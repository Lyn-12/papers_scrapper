1002000,"—The newly inaugurated Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals, which was created under the auspices of the National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health, is intended to stimulate current research and new investigations in the study of cardiovascular and other complex biomedical signals. The resource has 3 interdependent components. PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is a library of open-source …",Ary L Goldberger and Luis AN Amaral and Leon Glass and Jeffrey M Hausdorff and Plamen Ch Ivanov and Roger G Mark and Joseph E Mietus and George B Moody and Chung-Kang Peng and H Eugene Stanley,9475,4750758308263025680,circulation,23,e215-e220,Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,"PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet: components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals",https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.cir.101.23.e215,101,2000,/scholar?cites=4750758308263025680,Jo0G0c0AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC

1002001,"We study the statistical properties of a variety of diverse  real-world networks. We present evidence of the occurrence of three  classes of small-world networks: (a) scale-free  networks, characterized by a vertex connectivity distribution that  decays as a power law; (b) broad-scale networks,  characterized by a connectivity distribution that has a power law  regime followed by a sharp cutoff; and (c) single-scale  networks, characterized by a connectivity distribution with a fast  decaying tail. Moreover, we note for the classes of broad-scale and  single-scale networks that there are constraints limiting the addition  of new links. Our results suggest that the nature of such constraints  may be the controlling factor for the emergence of different classes of  networks.",Luıs A Nunes Amaral and Antonio Scala and Marc Barthelemy and H Eugene Stanley,3826,5604438367247770653,Proceedings of the national academy of sciences,21,11149-11152,National Academy of Sciences,Classes of small-world networks,https://www.pnas.org/content/97/21/11149.short,97,2000,/scholar?cites=5604438367247770653,Jo0G0c0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C

1002002,"High-throughput techniques are leading to an explosive growth in the size of biological databases and creating the opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of life and disease. Interpretation of these data remains, however, a major scientific challenge. Here, we propose a methodology that enables us to extract and display information contained in complex networks 1, 2, 3. Specifically, we demonstrate that we can find functional modules 4, 5 in complex networks, and classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra-and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a ‘cartographic representation’of complex networks. Metabolic networks 6, 7, 8 are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability 9. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms.

1002003,"According to classical concepts of physiologic control, healthy systems are self-regulated to reduce variability and maintain physiologic constancy. Contrary to the predictions of homeostasis, however, the output of a wide variety of systems, such as the normal human heartbeat, fluctuates in a complex manner, even under resting conditions. Scaling techniques adapted from statistical physics reveal the presence of long-range, power-law correlations, as part of multifractal cascades operating over a wide range of time scales. These scaling properties suggest that the nonlinear regulatory systems are operating far from equilibrium, and that maintaining constancy is not the goal of physiologic control. In contrast, for subjects at high risk of sudden death (including those with heart failure), fractal organization, along with certain nonlinear interactions, breaks down. Application of fractal analysis may provide new …",Ary L Goldberger and Luis AN Amaral and Jeffrey M Hausdorff and Plamen Ch Ivanov and C-K Peng and H Eugene Stanley,2177,2154374958833537422,Proceedings of the national academy of sciences,suppl 1,2466-2472,National Academy of Sciences,Fractal dynamics in physiology: alterations with disease and aging,https://www.pnas.org/content/99/suppl_1/2466.short,99,2002,/scholar?cites=2154374958833537422,Jo0G0c0AAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C

Here we investigate the delicate biomechanics of the fly’s minute antennal hearing organs and show that they look and work like a lock and key. Rotating in response to sound, the antenna’s distal segment mechanically activates the auditory receptors—thereby ‘unlocking’the mechanism arista oscillates as a stiff rod, with its vibration velocity continuously decreasing from tip to base. Remarkably, this oscillation is accompanied by rotation of the third segment.

We find that the worldwide air transportation network is a scale-free small-world network. In contrast to the prediction of scale-free network models, however, we find that the most connected cities are not necessarily the most central, resulting in anomalous values of the centrality. We demonstrate that these anomalies arise because of the multicommunity structure of the network. We identify the communities in the air transportation network and show that the community structure cannot be explained solely based on geographical constraints and that geopolitical considerations have to be taken into account.

1002007,"Agents in creative enterprises are embedded in networks that inspire, support, and evaluate their work. Here, we investigate how the mechanisms by which creative teams self-assemble determine the structure of these collaboration networks. We propose a model for the self-assembly of creative teams that has its basis in three parameters: team size, the fraction of newcomers in new productions, and the tendency of incumbents to repeat previous collaborations. The model suggests that the emergence of a large connected community of practitioners can be described as a phase transition. We find that team assembly mechanisms determine both the structure of the collaboration network and team performance for teams derived from both artistic and scientific fields.",Roger Guimera and Brian Uzzi and Jarrett Spiro and Luis A Nunes Amaral,1171,750656149951477932,Science,5722,697-702,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Team assembly mechanisms determine collaboration network structure and team performance,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/308/5722/697.abstract,308,2005,/scholar?cites=750656149951477932,Jo0G0c0AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC

Directed unipartite networks only have one type of node, but links have an origin and an end.

A caveat of this approach is that the relevance of global properties hinges on the premise that networks are homogeneous, whereas most real-world networks have a markedly modular structure.

Recent research suggest that team work is of crucial importance to cutting-edge scientific research, but little is known about how teamwork leads to greater creativity. Indeed, for many team activities, it is not even clear how to assign credit to individual team members. Remarkably, at least in the context of sports, there is usually a broad consensus on who are the top performers and on what qualifies as an outstanding performance.  Methodology/Principal Findings In order to determine how individual features can be quantified, and as a test bed for other team-based human activities, we analyze the performance of players in the European Cup 2008 soccer tournament.

1002048,"Studying the interaction between a system's components and the temporal evolution of the system are two common ways to uncover and characterize its internal workings. Recently, several maps from a time series to a network have been proposed with the intent of using network metrics to characterize time series. Although these maps demonstrate that different time series result in networks with distinct topological properties, it remains unclear how these topological properties relate to the original time series. Here, we propose a map from a time series to a network with an approximate inverse operation, making it possible to use network statistics to characterize time series and time series statistics to characterize networks. As a proof of concept, we generate an ensemble of time series ranging from periodic to random and confirm that application of the proposed map retains much of the information encoded in the original time series (or networks) after application of the map (or its inverse). Our results suggest that network analysis can be used to distinguish different dynamic regimes in time series and, perhaps more importantly, time series analysis can provide a powerful set of tools that augment the traditional network analysis toolkit to quantify networks in new and useful ways.",Andriana SLO Campanharo and M Irmak Sirer and R Dean Malmgren and Fernando M Ramos and Luís A Nunes Amaral,178,15795584081319018964,PloS one,8,e23378,Public Library of Science,Duality between time series and networks,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023378,6,2011,/scholar?cites=15795584081319018964,Jo0G0c0AAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC

Simply put, statistical physicists have determined that physical systems which consist of a large number of interacting particles obey universal laws that are independent of the microscopic details.

This may help to build a more complete characterization of the nature and processes behind firm growth.To date, the study of firm dynamics has primarily focused on whether small firms on average have higher growth rates than large firms.

Our approach uses fundamental engineering principles, together with a limited set of experimentally derived facts, and provides quantitatively accurate predictions of performance under a range of physiologically relevant conditions. We generated detailed time-resolved experimental data to evaluate the ability of our model to describe the dynamics of C. elegans reproduction.

1002127,"Yan is an ETS-domain transcription factor responsible for maintaining Drosophila eye cells in a multipotent state. Yan is at the core of a regulatory network that determines the time and place in which cells transit from multipotency to one of several differentiated lineages. Using a fluorescent reporter for Yan expression, we observed a biphasic distribution of Yan in multipotent cells, with a rapid inductive phase and slow decay phase. Transitions to various differentiated states occurred over the course of this dynamic process, suggesting that Yan expression level does not strongly determine cell potential. Consistent with this conclusion, perturbing Yan expression by varying gene dosage had no effect on cell fate transitions. However, we observed that as cells transited to differentiation, Yan expression became highly heterogeneous and this heterogeneity was transient. Signals received via the EGF Receptor were necessary for the transience in Yan noise since genetic loss caused sustained noise. Since these signals are essential for eye cells to differentiate, we suggest that dynamic heterogeneity of Yan is a necessary element of the transition process, and cell states are stabilized through noise reduction.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08924.001",Nicolás Peláez and Arnau Gavalda-Miralles and Bao Wang and Heliodoro Tejedor Navarro and Herman Gudjonson and Ilaria Rebay and Aaron R Dinner and Aggelos K Katsaggelos and Luís AN Amaral and Richard W Carthew,27,9222379221067719008,Elife,,e08924,eLife Sciences Publications Limited,Dynamics and heterogeneity of a fate determinant during transition towards cell differentiation,https://elifesciences.org/articles/08924,4,2015,/scholar?cites=9222379221067719008,Jo0G0c0AAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC

Using this conceptual framework as a guide, we empirically quantify the relation between trading activity—measured by the number of transactions N—and the price change G (t) for a given stock, over a time interval [t, t+ Δt]. We relate the time-dependent standard deviation of price changes—volatility—to two microscopic quantities: the number of transactions N (t) in Δt and the variance W 2 (t) of the price changes for all transactions in Δt. We find that the long-ranged volatility correlations are largely due to those of N. We then argue that the tail-exponent of the distribution of N is insufficient to account for the tail-exponent of P {G> x …",H Eugene Stanley and Luis A Nunes Amaral and Xavier Gabaix and Parameswaran Gopikrishnan and Vasiliki Plerou,19,3107357874330656804,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,1-4,126-137,North-Holland,Quantifying economic fluctuations,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437101005040,302,2001,/scholar?cites=3107357874330656804,Jo0G0c0AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC

Progress was made possible by a remarkable combination of experiment and phenomenological theory. To help conceptualize the problem, the Ising model came to play a key role, and indeed most of the ideas that emerged—save one—were tested on this model system. 2 The Ising model is defined as a set of classical spins localized on the sites of a lattice.

The number of genomic, proteomic and metabolomic datasets has increased dramatically over the last two decades, far outstripping the pace of curation efforts. Here, we tackle the challenge of curating metabolic network reconstructions. We predict organismal metabolic networks using sequence homology and a global metabolic network constructed from all available organismal networks. While sequence homology has been a standard to annotate metabolic networks it has been faulted for its lack of predictive power.

However, the nature of these neural interactions and their relation to reading performance are still poorly understood. Functional connectivity analyses of fMRI data can be used to characterize the nature of interactivity of distributed brain networks, yet most previous studies have focused on connectivity during task-free (i.e., “resting state”) conditions. Here, we report new methods for assessing task-related functional connectivity using data-driven graph theoretical methods and describe how large-scale patterns of connectivity relate to individual variability in reading performance among children. We found that connectivity patterns of subjects performing a reading task could be decomposed hierarchically into multiple sub-networks, and we observed stronger long-range interaction between sub-networks in subjects with higher task accuracy. Additionally, we found a network of hub regions known to be critical to reading that displays increased short-range synchronization in higher accuracy subjects. These individual differences in task-related functional connectivity reveal that increased interaction between distant regions, coupled with selective local integration within key regions, is associated with better reading performance.

Experimental studies have shown that the SD sequence facilitates start codon recognition and enhances translation initiation by directly interacting with the highly conserved anti-SD sequence on the 30S ribosomal subunit. However, the proportion of SD-led genes within a genome varies across species and the factors governing this variation in translation initiation mechanisms remain largely unknown.

This complexity and the availability of large number of recorded matches make chess an ideal model systems for the study of population-level learning of a complex system. We systematically investigate the move-by-move dynamics of the white player’s advantage from over seventy thousand high level chess matches spanning over 150 years. We find that the average advantage of the white player is positive and that it has been increasing over time. Currently, the average advantage of the white player is 0.17 pawns but it is exponentially approaching a value of 0.23 pawns with a characteristic time scale of 67 years. We also study the diffusion of the move dependence of the white player’s advantage and find that it is non-Gaussian, has long-ranged anti-correlations and that after an initial period with no diffusion it becomes super-diffusive. We find that the duration of the non-diffusive period, corresponding to the opening stage of a match, is increasing in length and exponentially approaching a value of 15.6 moves with a characteristic time scale of 130 years. We interpret these two trends as a resulting from learning of the features of the game.

The identification of the fundamental unit operations allowed chemical engineering to focus on the processes as opposed to the product, which in turn has enabled the discipline to move into a multitude of new directions. The application of chemical engineering principles to biological processes at the cell-to-tissue scale has been particularly successful, leading a number of prominent departments to change their names to include some variant of ‘‘Biological.’’Yet the emphasis of the research in these departments has largely remained focused on the smallest biological scales, missing the opportunity to tackle the most complex and interconnected biological system on Earth—the biosphere.

1002165,"The existence of over- and under-represented sequence motifs in genomes provides evidence of selective evolutionary pressures on biological mechanisms such as transcription, translation, ligand-substrate binding, and host immunity. In order to accurately identify motifs and other genome-scale patterns of interest, it is essential to be able to generate accurate null models that are appropriate for the sequences under study. While many tools have been developed to create random nucleotide sequences, protein coding sequences are subject to a unique set of constraints that complicates the process of generating appropriate null models. There are currently no tools available that allow users to create random coding sequences with specified amino acid composition and GC content for the purpose of hypothesis testing. Using the principle of maximum entropy, we developed a method that generates unbiased random sequences with pre-specified amino acid and GC content, which we have developed into a python package. Our method is the simplest way to obtain maximally unbiased random sequences that are subject to GC usage and primary amino acid sequence constraints. Furthermore, this approach can easily be expanded to create unbiased random sequences that incorporate more complicated constraints such as individual nucleotide usage or even di-nucleotide frequencies. The ability to generate correctly specified null models will allow researchers to accurately identify sequence motifs which will lead to a better understanding of biological processes as well as more effective engineering of biological systems.",Sophia S Liu and Adam J Hockenberry and Andrea Lancichinetti and Michael C Jewett and Luís AN Amaral,9,4662591259512776387,PLoS computational biology,11,e1005184,Public Library of Science,NullSeq: a tool for generating random coding sequences with desired amino acid and GC contents,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005184,12,2016,/scholar?cites=4662591259512776387,Jo0G0c0AAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC

1002175,"Social groups of interacting agents display an ability to coordinate in the absence of a central authority, a phenomenon that has been recently amplified by the widespread availability of social networking technologies. Models of opinion formation in a population of agents have proven a very useful tool to investigate these phenomena that arise independently of the heterogeneities across individuals and can be used to identify the factors that determine whether widespread consensus on an initial small majority is reached. Recently, we introduced a model in which individual agents can have conservative and partisan biases. Numerical simulations for finite populations showed that while the inclusion of conservative agents in a population enhances the population's efficiency in reaching consensus on the initial majority opinion, even a small fraction of partisans leads the population to converge on the opinion initially held by a minority. To further understand the mechanisms leading to our previous numerical results, we investigate analytically the noise driven transition from a regime in which the population reaches a majority consensus (efficient), to a regime in which the population settles in deadlock (non-efficient). We show that the mean-field solution captures what we observe in model simulations. Populations of agents with no opinion bias show a continuous transition to a deadlock regime, while populations with an opinion bias, show a discontinuous transition between efficient and partisan regimes.

We therefore analyzed age-resolved transcriptomic data from 17 mouse organs and 51 human organs using unsupervised machine learning to identify the architectural and regulatory characteristics most informative on the differential expression of genes with age.

We also demonstrate that in a mouse model of healthy aging, length-driven transcriptome imbalance correlates with changes in expression of splicing factor proline and glutamine rich (Sfpq), which regulates transcriptional elongation according to gene length.

1002187,"We empirically quantify the relation between trading activity — measured by the number of transactions N — and the price change G(t) for a given stock, over a time interval [t, t + Δt]. We relate the time-dependent standard deviation of price changes—volatility—to two microscopic quantities: the number of transactions N(t) in Δt and the variance W 2(t) of the price changes for all transactions in Δt. We find that the long-ranged volatility correlations are largely due to those of N. We then argue that the tail-exponent of the distribution of N is insufficient to account for the tail-exponent of P{G > x}. Our results suggest that the fat tails of the distribution P{G > x} arises from W, which has a power-law distribution with an exponent consistent with that of G.",P Gopikrishnan and V Plerou and X Gabaix and LAN Amaral and HE Stanley,2,7356601797577828617,,,12-17,"Springer, Tokyo",Price fluctuations and market activity,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-66993-7_2,,2002,/scholar?cites=7356601797577828617,Jo0G0c0AAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC

1002188,"Even under healthy, basal conditions, physiologic systems show erratic fluctuations resembling those found in dynamical systems driven away from an equilibrium state. Do such “nonequilibrium” fluctuations simply reflect the fact that physiologic systems are being constantly perturbed by external and intrinsic uncorrelated noise? Or, do these fluctuations actually contain “hidden” information about the underlying nonequilibrium control mechanisms? We report some recent attempts to understand the dynamics of complex physiologic fluctuations by adapting and extending concepts and methods developed very recently in statistical physics. Specifically, we focus on interbeat interval variability as an important quantity to help elucidate possibly nonhomeostatic physiologic variability because (i) the heart rate is under direct neuroautonomic control, (ii) interbeat interval variability is readily measured by noninvasive …",HE Stanley and Luis AN Amaral and AL Goldberger and S Havlin and P Ch Ivanov and C-K Peng,2,155657444801818840,AIP Conference Proceedings,1,133-145,American Institute of Physics,Monofractal and multifractal approaches to complex biomedical signals,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1302377,502,2000,/scholar?cites=155657444801818840,Jo0G0c0AAAAJ:vDZJ-YLwNdEC

1002191,"Female representation has been slowly but steadily increasing in many sectors of society. One sector where one would expect to see gender parity is the movie industry, yet the representation of females in most functions within the U.S. movie industry remain surprisingly low. Here, we study the historical patterns of female representation among actors, directors, and producers in an attempt to gain insights into the possible causes of the lack of gender parity in the industry. Our analyses reveals a remarkable temporal coincidence between the collapse in female representation across all functions and the advent of the Studio System, a period when the major Hollywood studios controlled all aspects of the industry. Female representation among actors, directors, producers and writers dropped to extraordinarily low values during the emergence and consolidation of the Studio System that in some cases have not yet recovered to pre-Studio System levels. In order to explore some possible mechanisms behind these patterns, we investigate the association between the gender balance of actors, writers, directors, and producers and a number of economic indicators, movie industry indicators, and movie characteristics. We find robust, strong, and significant associations which are consistent with an important role for the gender of decision makers on the gender balance of other industry functions. While in no way demonstrating causality, our findings add new perspectives to the discussions of the reasons for female under-representation in fields such as computer science and medicine, that have also experienced dramatic changes in female representation.",Luís A Nunes Amaral and João AG Moreira and Murielle L Dunand and Heliodoro Tejedor Navarro and Hyojun Ada Lee,1,387552169874006309,PloS one,4,e0229662,Public Library of Science,Long-term patterns of gender imbalance in an industry without ability or level of interest differences,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229662,15,2020,/scholar?cites=387552169874006309,Jo0G0c0AAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC

These advances were initially driven by information-poor empirical networks and theoretical analysis of unweighted and undirected graphs. Recently, information-rich empirical data complex networks supported the development of more sophisticated models that include edge directionality and weight properties, and multiple layers. Many studies still focus on unweighted undirected description of networks, prompting an essential question: how to identify when a model is simpler than it must be?

Physician under-recognition of ARDS is a significant barrier to LTVV use. We propose a computational method that addresses some of the limitations of the current approaches to automated measurement of whether ARDS is recognized by physicians.   Objective To quantify patient and physician factors affecting physicians’ tidal volume selection and to build a computational model of physician recognition of ARDS that accounts for these factors.   Design, setting, and participants In this cross-sectional study, electronic health record data were collected for 361 ARDS patients and 388 non-ARDS hypoxemic (control) patients in nine adult intensive care units at four hospitals between June 24 and December 31, 2013.   Methods Standardized tidal volumes (mL/kg predicted body weight) were chosen as a proxy for physician decision-making behavior. Using data-science approaches, we quantified the effect of eight factors (six severity of illness, two physician behaviors) on selected standardized tidal volumes in ARDS and control patients. Significant factors were incorporated in computational behavioral models of physician recognition of ARDS.   Results Hypoxemia severity and ARDS documentation in physicians’ notes were associated with lower standardized tidal volumes in the ARDS cohort. Greater patient height was associated with lower standardized tidal volumes (which is already normalized for height) in both ARDS and control patients.

1002194,"High-throughput experimental techniques and bioinformatics tools make it possible to obtain reconstructions of the metabolism of microbial species. Combined with mathematical frameworks such as flux balance analysis, which assumes that nutrients are used so as to maximize growth, these reconstructions enable us to predict microbial growth. Although such predictions are generally accurate, these approaches do not give insights on how different nutrients are used to produce growth, and thus are difficult to generalize to new media or to different organisms. Here, we propose a systems-level phenomenological model of metabolism inspired by the virial expansion.

1002195,"The ability of microbial species to consume compounds found in the environment to generate commercially-valuable products has long been exploited by humanity. The untapped, staggering diversity of microbial organisms offers a wealth of potential resources for tackling medical, environmental, and energy challenges. Understanding microbial metabolism will be crucial to many of these potential applications. Thermodynamically-feasible metabolic reconstructions can be used, under some conditions, to predict the growth rate of certain microbes using constraint-based methods. While these reconstructions are powerful, they are still cumbersome to build and, because of the complexity of metabolic networks, it is hard for researchers to gain from these reconstructions an understanding of why a certain nutrient yields a given growth rate for a given microbe. Here, we present a simple model of biomass production that accurately reproduces the predictions of thermodynamically-feasible metabolic reconstructions. Our model makes use of only: i) a nutrient's structure and function, ii) the presence of a small number of enzymes in the organism, and iii) the carbon flow in pathways that catabolize nutrients. When applied to test organisms, our model allows us to predict whether a nutrient can be a carbon source with an accuracy of about 90% with respect to in silico experiments. In addition, our model provides excellent predictions of whether a medium will produce more or less growth than another () and good predictions of the actual value of the in silico biomass production.",Samuel MD Seaver and Marta Sales-Pardo and Roger Guimerà and Luís A Nunes Amaral,1,6770090656432156160,PLoS Comput Biol,11,e1002762,Public Library of Science,Phenomenological model for predicting the catabolic potential of an arbitrary nutrient,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002762,8,2012,/scholar?cites=6770090656432156160,Jo0G0c0AAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC

Combining these techniques with quantitative microscopy enables researchers to rigorously compare RNA or protein expression across the resultant clones.

1002200,"Allostery governing two conformational states is one of the proposed mechanisms for catch‐bond behavior in adhesive proteins. In FimH, a catch‐bond protein expressed by pathogenic bacteria, separation of two domains disrupts inhibition by the pilin domain. Thus, tensile force can induce a conformational change in the lectin domain, from an inactive state to an active state with high affinity. To better understand allosteric inhibition in two‐domain FimH (H2 inactive), we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the lectin domain alone, which has high affinity (HL active), and also the lectin domain stabilized in the low‐affinity conformation by an Arg‐60‐Pro mutation (HL mutant).
