1009001,A new on-line learning algorithm which minimizes a statistical dependency among outputs is derived for blind separation of mixed signals. The dependency is measured by the average mutual information (MI) of the outputs. The source signals and the mixing matrix are unknown except for the number of the sources. The Gram-Charlier expansion instead of the Edgeworth expansion is used in evaluating the MI. The natural gradient approach is used to minimize the MI. A novel activation function is proposed for the on-line learning algorithm which has an equivariant property and is easily implemented on a neural network like model. The validity of the new learning algorithm are verified by computer simulations.,Shun-ichi Amari and Andrzej Cichocki and Howard Hua Yang,2916,5446763710069107402,,,757-763,,A new learning algorithm for blind signal separation,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1115-a-new-learning-algorithm-for-blind-signal-separation.pdf,,1996,/scholar?cites=5446763710069107402,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C

1009003,"This book provides a broad survey of models and efficient algorithms for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). This includes NMF’s various extensions and modifications, especially Nonnegative Tensor Factorizations (NTF) and Nonnegative Tucker Decompositions (NTD). NMF/NTF and their extensions are increasingly used as tools in signal and image processing, and data analysis, having garnered interest due to their capability to provide new insights and relevant information about the complex latent relationships in experimental data sets. It is suggested that NMF can provide meaningful components with physical interpretations; for example, in bioinformatics, NMF and its extensions have been successfully applied to gene expression, sequence analysis, the functional characterization of genes, clustering and text mining. As such, the authors focus on the algorithms that are most useful in practice, looking at the fastest, most robust, and suitable for large-scale models. Key features: Acts as a single source reference guide to NMF, collating information that is widely dispersed in current literature, including the authors’ own recently developed techniques in the subject area.

1009008,"Blind source separation (BSS) and independent component analysis (ICA) are generally based on a wide class of unsupervised learning algorithms and they found potential applications in many areas from engineering to neuroscience. A recent trend in BSS is to consider problems in the framework of matrix factorization or more general signals decomposition with probabilistic generative and tree structured graphical models and exploit a priori knowledge about true nature and structure of latent (hidden) variables or sources such as spatio-temporal decorrelation, statistical independence, sparseness, smoothness or lowest complexity in the sense eg, of best predictability. The possible goal of such decomposition can be considered as the estimation of sources not necessary statistically independent and parameters of a mixing system or more generally as finding a new reduced or hierarchical and structured representation for the observed (sensor) data that can be interpreted as physically meaningful coding or blind source estimation. The key issue is to find a such transformation or coding (linear or nonlinear) which has true physical meaning and interpretation. We present a review of BSS and ICA, including various algorithms for static and dynamic models and their applications. The paper mainly consists of three parts:(1) BSS algorithms for static models (instantaneous mixtures);(2) extension of BSS and ICA incorporating with sparseness or non-negativity constraints;(3) BSS algorithms for dynamic models (convolutive mixtures).",Seungjin Choi and Andrzej Cichocki and Hyung-Min Park and Soo-Young Lee,530,2298468057868141971,Neural Information Processing-Letters and Reviews,1,1-57,,Blind source separation and independent component analysis: A review,http://www.academia.edu/download/48190005/Blind_source_separation_and_independent_20160819-6154-6wy5zx.pdf,6,2005,/scholar?cites=2298468057868141971,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC

Standard clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means method) also can be used for estimating the mixing matrix if the sources are sufficiently sparse. Compared with the DUET, the TIFROM methods, and standard clustering algorithms, with the authors' proposed method, a broader class of problems can be solved, because the required key condition on sparsity of the sources can be considerably relaxed.

1009025,"In this paper we develop several algorithms for non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in applications to blind (or semi blind) source separation (BSS), when sources are generally statistically dependent under conditions that additional constraints are imposed such as nonnegativity, sparsity, smoothness, lower complexity or better predictability. We express the non-negativity constraints using a wide class of loss (cost) functions, which leads to an extended class of multiplicative algorithms with regularization. The proposed relaxed forms of the NMF algorithms have a higher convergence speed with the desired constraints. Moreover, the effects of various regularization and constraints are clearly shown.

In this book we describe two large classes of analog integrated circuits:• switched capacitor (SC) networks,• continuous-time CMOS (unswitched) circuits. SC networks are sampled-data systems in which electric charges are transferred from one point to another at regular discrete intervals of time and thus the signal samples are stored and processed. Other circuits belonging to this class of sampled-data systems are charge transfer devices (CTD) and charge coupled dev ices (CCD).

1009047,"Medical studies have shown that EEG of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is “slower” (i.e., contains more low-frequency power) and is less complex compared to age-matched healthy subjects. The relation between those two phenomena has not yet been studied, and they are often silently assumed to be independent. In this paper, it is shown that both phenomena are strongly related. Strong correlation between slowing and loss of complexity is observed in two independent EEG datasets: (1) EEG of predementia patients (a.k.a. Mild Cognitive Impairment; MCI) and control subjects; (2) EEG of mild AD patients and control subjects. The two data sets are from different patients, different hospitals and obtained through different recording systems. The paper also investigates the potential of EEG slowing and loss of EEG complexity as indicators of AD onset.

It is known that the independent signals in the observed mixtures can be successfully extracted except for their order and scales. In order to resolve the indeterminacy of scales, most learning algorithms impose some constraints on the magnitudes of the recovered signals. However, when the source signals are nonstationary and their average magnitudes change rapidly, the constraints force a rapid change in the magnitude of the separating matrix. This is the case with most applications (e.g., speech sounds, electroencephalogram signals). It is known that this causes numerical instability in some cases.

In the present article, we study the differential-geometrical structure of a manifold induced by a divergence function. It consists of a Riemannian metric, and a pair of dually coupled affine connections, which are studied in information geometry. The class of Bregman divergences are characterized by a dually flat structure, which is originated from the Legendre duality. A dually flat space admits a generalized Pythagorean theorem. The class of f-divergences, defined on a manifold of probability distributions, is characterized by information monotonicity, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence belongs to the intersection of both classes.

1009072,"In this paper, fully connected recurrent neural networks are investigated for blind separation of sources. For these networks, a new class of unsupervised on-line learning algorithms are proposed. These algorithms are the generalization of the Hebbian/anti-Hebbian rule. They are not only biologically plausible but also theoretically sound. An important property of these algorithms is that the performance of the networks is independent of the mixing matrix and the scaling factor of the input sources. This property is veri ed by analyses and simulations. I. IntroductionThe problem of multi-channel blind separation of sources such as the\cocktail-party"" problem arises in diverse elds in neural computation (including hearing and olfactory systems) and in applied science (including radar, speech processing and digital communication). The problem is how to separate signal sources from the sensor output in which the sources are mixed in an unknown channel, a multiple-input multipleoutput linear system. The problem is to recover the original waveforms of the sources. In the\cocktailparty"" problem, a person who wants to listen to a single speaker or locate a sound source must lter out noise and interferences such as other people's voice and echoes. An under water sonar system has to solve a similar problem in order to recognize a target. The area of blind separation is closely related to the modeling and signal processing problems in neuroscience. Animals and human beings have remarkable capabilities to localize sounds and to recognize speeches. They can also recognize di erent odors in a complicated environment by their olfactory systems …",Shun-ichi Amari and Andrzej Cichocki and Howard H Yang,124,7998072374721884559,Proc. Int. Symp.

In the canonical P300 BCI approach, items on a monitor flash briefly to elicit the necessary ERPs. Very recent work has shown that this approach may yield lower performance than alternate paradigms in which the items do not flash but instead change in other ways, such as moving, changing colour or changing to characters overlaid with faces.   Methodology/Principal Findings The present study sought to extend this research direction by parametrically comparing different ways to change items in a P300 BCI. Healthy subjects used a P300 BCI across six different conditions. Three conditions were similar to our prior work, providing the first direct comparison of characters flashing, moving, and changing to faces. Three new conditions also explored facial motion and emotional expression. The six conditions were compared across objective measures such as classification accuracy and bit rate as well as subjective measures such as perceived difficulty. In line with recent studies, our results indicated that the character flash condition resulted in the lowest accuracy and bit rate. All four face conditions (mean accuracy >91%) yielded significantly better performance than the flash condition (mean accuracy = 75%).

1009094,"Here we report that a specific form of yoga can generate controlled high-frequency gamma waves. For the first time, paroxysmal gamma waves (PGW) were observed in eight subjects practicing a yoga technique of breathing control called Bhramari Pranayama (BhPr). To obtain new insights into the nature of the EEG during BhPr, we analyzed EEG signals using time-frequency representations (TFR), independent component analysis (ICA), and EEG tomography (LORETA). We found that the PGW consists of high-frequency biphasic ripples. This unusual activity is discussed in relation to previous reports on yoga and meditation. It is concluded this EEG activity is most probably non-epileptic, and that applying the same methodology to other meditation recordings might yield an improved understanding of the neurocorrelates of meditation.",François B Vialatte and Hovagim Bakardjian and Rajkishore Prasad and Andrzej Cichocki,103,2744255602600129042,Consciousness and cognition,4,977-988,Academic Press,EEG paroxysmal gamma waves during Bhramari Pranayama: a yoga breathing technique,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810008000056,18,2009,/scholar?cites=2744255602600129042,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC

Most of the existing algorithms for the PARAFAC, especially the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm need to compute Khatri–Rao products of tall factors and multiplication of large matrices, and due to this require high computational cost and large memory and are not suitable for very large-scale-problems. Hence, PARAFAC for large-scale data tensors is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on a modified ALS algorithm which computes Hadamard products, instead Khatri–Rao products, and employs relatively small matrices.

An efficient SSVEP-based BCI system in shorter time with higher accuracy in recognizing SSVEP has been pursued by many studies. This paper introduces a novel multiway canonical correlation analysis (Multiway CCA) approach to recognize SSVEP. This approach is based on tensor CCA and focuses on multiway data arrays. Multiple CCAs are used to find appropriate reference signals for SSVEP recognition from different data arrays. SSVEP is then recognized by implementing multiple linear regression (MLR) between EEG and optimized reference signals. The proposed Multiway CCA is verified by comparing to the standard CCA and power spectral density analysis (PSDA).

First, we review the current state of the art of blind deconvolution using statespace models, then give a new insight into blind deconvolution in the state-space framework.

The information backpropagation approach is developed for training the internal parameters. In order to compensate for the model bias and reduce the e ect of noise, we introduce the Kalman lter to the blind deconvolution setting.

1009101,Many of the most widely accepted methods for reliable detection of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) utilize canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA uses pure sine and cosine reference templates with frequencies corresponding to the visual stimulation frequencies. These generic reference templates may not optimally reflect the natural SSVEP features obscured by the background EEG. This paper introduces a new approach that utilizes spatio-temporal feature extraction with multivariate linear regression (MLR) to learn discriminative SSVEP features for improving the detection accuracy. MLR is implemented on dimensionality-reduced EEG training data and a constructed label matrix to find optimally discriminative subspaces.

Second, the BCI system often misclassifies the EEG signals as commands, although the subject is not performing any task.

We propose a quasi-Newton approach for determining this saddle point. This enables us to obtain a family of separation algorithms which, based on higher order statistics, yields unbiased estimates even in the presence of large Gaussian noise and has the interesting property of local isotropic convergence.

The new learning equations for the hidden layer are different from our previous learning equations for the output layer. The natural gradient descent method is applied in maximizing entropy and minimizing mutual information.

The main motivation for using a multi {layer network instead of a single layer one for the blind separation problem is to improve the performance and robustness of separation while applying local learning rules.

In this paper, by exploiting the uniqueness of CPD and the relation of a tensor in Kruskal form and its unfolded tensor, we propose a fast approach to deal with this problem.

1009245,"Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and related methods like Adaptive Factor Analysis (AFA) are promising novel approaches for elimination of artifacts and noise from biomedical signals, especially EEG/MEG data. However, most of the methods require manual detection and classification of interference components. Main objective of this paper is to detect and eliminate noise and some artifacts automatically by computer using criteria for classification, ordering and detection of noisy and random signals. The automatic detection and on-line elimination of noise and other interferences is especially important for long recordings, eg EEG/MEG recording during sleep. In this paper we focus mainly on the problem of'cleaning'or enhancement of noisy EEG/MEG data from noise and undesired interferences using several techniques: ICA and HOS measure of Gaussianity (to detect and eliminate Gaussian noise), linear predictor (to detect iid sources and classify temporally structured sources) and Hurst exponent (to detect randomness in independent components and classify independent signals).

1009247,In this paper a neural network approach to the on-line solution of linear inequality systems is considered. Three different techniques are discussed and for each technique a novel neural network implementation is proposed. The first technique is a standard penalty method implemented as an analog neural network. The second technique is based on the transformation of inequality constraints into equality constraints with simple bounds on the variables. The transformed problem is then solved using least squares (LS) and least absolute values (LAV) optimisation criteria. The third technique makes use of the regularised total least squares criterion (RTLS).

SES may be applied to generic one-dimensional and multi-dimensional point processes, however, the paper mainly focusses on point processes in time-frequency domain. The average event similarity is in that case described by two parameters: the average frequency offset between events in the time-frequency plane, and the variance of the frequency offset (“frequency jitter”); SES then consists of five parameters in total. Those parameters quantify the synchrony of oscillatory events, and hence, they provide an alternative to existing synchrony measures that quantify amplitude or phase synchrony. The pairwise alignment of point processes is cast as a statistical inference problem, which is solved by applying the maxproduct algorithm on a graphical model. The SES parameters are determined from the resulting pairwise alignment by maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation.

Computer simulation experiments con rm the validity of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that it is useful extension of existing neural network solutions to blind separation problem as extraction of particular source signals with prede ned stochastic characteristic is possible. I. IntroductionIn blind separation problem, the task is to recover original signals from their linear mixture without knowing the mixing coe cients. Such kind of problem occurs in many areas of science and engineering, eg, in biomedical signal processing (ECG or EEG), speech recognition (cocktail party problem), image enhancement and in telecommunication [1, 3-6, 8-11]. Most of the known e cient algorithms separate signals simultaneously under an assumption that the number of sources is known [1, 3, 4, 9, 11].

1009297,"EN A multiway blind source separation (MBSS) method is developed to decompose large-scale tensor (multiway array) data. Benefitting from all kinds of well-established constrained low-rank matrix factorization methods, MBSS is quite flexible and able to extract unique and interpretable components with physical meaning. The multilinear structure of Tucker and the essential uniqueness of BSS methods allow MBSS to estimate each component matrix separately from an unfolding matrix in each mode. Consequently, alternating least squares (ALS) iterations, which are considered as the workhorse for tensor decompositions, can be avoided and various robust and efficient dimensionality reduction methods can be easily incorporated to pre-process the data, which makes MBSS extremely fast, especially for large-scale problems. Identification and uniqueness conditions are also discussed. Two practical issues dimensionality reduction and estimation of number of components are also addressed based on sparse and random fibers sampling. Extensive simulations confirmed the validity, flexibility, and high efficiency of the proposed method. We also demonstrated by simulations that the MBSS approach can successfully extract desired components while most existing algorithms may fail for ill-conditioned and large-scale problems.",Guoxu Zhou and Andrzej Cichocki,26,4541923938856860263,Bulletin of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

1009305,"Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and its extension known as nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) are emerging techniques that have been proposed recently. The goal of NMF/NTF is to decompose a nonnegative data matrix into a product of lower-rank nonnegative matrices or tensors (ie, multiway arrays). An NMF approach similar to independent component analysis (ICA) or sparse component analysis (SCA) is very useful and promising for decomposing highdimensional datasets into a lower-dimensional space. A great deal of interest has been given very recently to NMF models and techniques due to their capability of providing new insights and relevant information on the complex latent relationships in experimental datasets, and due to providing meaningful components with physical or physiological interpretations. For example, in bioinformatics, NMF and its extensions have been successfully applied to gene expression, sequence analysis, functional characterization of genes, clustering, and text mining. The main difference between NMF and other classical factorizations such as PCA, SCA, or ICA methods relies on the nonnegativity, and usually also additional constraints such as sparseness, smoothness, and/or orthogonality imposed on the models. These constraints tend to lead to a parts-based representation of the data, because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations of data items. In this way, the nonnegative components or factors produced by this approach can be interpreted as parts of the data.

The most challenging problem is related to determination of model complexity (ie, multilinear rank), especially when noise and missing data are present. In addition, existing methods cannot take into account uncertainty information of latent factors, resulting in low generalization performance. To address these issues, we present a class of probabilistic generative Tucker models for tensor decomposition and completion with structural sparsity over multilinear latent space. To exploit structural sparse modeling, we introduce two group sparsity inducing priors by hierarchial representation of Laplace and Student-t distributions, which facilitates fully posterior inference. For model learning, we derived variational Bayesian inferences over all model (hyper) parameters, and developed efficient and scalable algorithms based on multilinear operations.

1009319,"We present a novel framework for tensor valued Gaussian processes (GP) regression, which exploits a covariance function defined on tensor representation of data inputs. In this way, we bring together the powerful GP methods supported by Bayesian inference and higher-order tensor analysis techniques into one framework. This enables us to account for the underlying structure of data within the model, providing a powerful framework for structural data analysis, such as 3D video sequences. To this end, we propose a new kernel function with tensor arguments under the assumption of generative models, in the form of product kernels where a symmetrical Kullback-Leibler divergence measure is exploited to define the covariance function for tensorial data. A fully Bayesian treatment is employed to estimate the hyperparameters and infer the predictive distributions.

1009320,"Objective. EEG has great potential as a cost-effective screening tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the specificity of EEG is not yet sufficient to be used in clinical practice. In an earlier study, we presented preliminary results suggesting improved specificity of EEG to early stages of Alzheimer's disease. The key to this improvement is a new method for extracting sparse oscillatory events from EEG signals in the time-frequency domain. Here we provide a more detailed analysis, demonstrating improved EEG specificity for clinical screening of MCI (mild cognitive impairment) patients. Methods. EEG data was recorded of MCI patients and age-matched control subjects, in rest condition with eyes closed. EEG frequency bands of interest were 𝜃 (3.5–7.5 Hz), 𝛼1 (7.5–9.5 Hz),  𝛼2 (9.5–12.5 Hz), and 𝛽  (12.5–25 Hz). The EEG signals were transformed in the time-frequency domain using complex Morlet wavelets; the resulting time-frequency maps are represented by sparse bump models. Results. Enhanced EEG power in the 𝜃  range is more easily detected through sparse bump modeling; this phenomenon explains the improved  EEG specificity obtained in our previous studies. Conclusions. Sparse bump modeling yields informative features in EEG signal.

In this approach, an adaptive recursive bandpass filter is employed for estimating and tracking the centre frequency associated with each EEG wave.

This coefficient, having an absolute value less than 1, represents an efficient distinct feature for each EEG specific wave, and its time function reflects the non-stationarity behaviour of the EEG signal.

Second, we consider the issue of separating sources in the frequency domain. We introduce a modified correlation matrix of observed signals and perform CBSS by diagonalization of the matrix. Third, we propose a method that can diagonalize the modified correlation matrix by solving a so-called normal equation for CBSS.

Due to the redundant information contained in multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, the classification accuracy of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems may deteriorate to a large extent. Channel selection methods can help to remove task-independent electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and hence improve the performance of BCI systems. However, in different frequency bands, brain areas associated with motor imagery are not exactly the same, which will result in the inability of traditional channel selection methods to extract effective EEG features. New Method. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a novel method based on common spatial pattern- (CSP-) rank channel selection for multifrequency band EEG (CSP-R-MF). It combines the multiband signal decomposition filtering and the CSP-rank channel selection methods to select significant channels, and then linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to calculate the classification accuracy.

In general, P300-based BCIs need to be trained, offline, for a considerable period of time, which causes users to become fatigued. This reduces the efficiency and performance of the system. In order to shorten calibration time and improve system performance, we introduce the concept of a generic model set. We used ERP data from 116 participants to train the generic model set. The resulting set consists of ten models, which are trained by weighted linear discriminant analysis (WLDA). Twelve new participants were then invited to test the validity of the generic model set.

Thus far, spatial information was not examined in depth in SSSEP BCI, because frequency information was regarded as the main concern of SSSEP analysis.

Although background music can influence emotion and performance in other task environments, and many users may wish to listen to music while using a BCI, auditory and other BCIs are typically studied without background music. Some work has explored the possibility of using polyphonic music in auditory BCI systems. However, this approach requires users with good musical skills, and has not been explored in online experiments. Our hypothesis was that an auditory BCI with background music would be preferred by subjects over a similar BCI without background music, without any difference in BCI performance. We introduce a simple paradigm (which does not require musical skill) using percussion instrument sound stimuli and background music, and evaluated it in both offline and online experiments. The result showed that subjects preferred the auditory BCI with background music. Different performance measures did not reveal any significant performance effect when comparing background music vs. no background.

1009420,"Low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) continue to face major challenges in providing high-quality and universally accessible health care. Researchers, policy makers, donors, and program implementers consistently strive to develop and provide innovative approaches to eliminate geographical and financial barriers to health care access. Recently, interest has increased in using mobile health (mHealth) as a potential solution to overcome barriers to improving health care in LMICs. Moreover, with use increasing and cost decreasing for mobile phones and Internet, mHealth solutions are becoming considerably more promising and efficient. As part of mHealth solutions, biomedical signals collection and processing may play a major role in improving global health care. Information extracted from biomedical signals might increase diagnostic precision while augmenting the robustness of health care workers’ clinical decision making.

1009422,"We propose a method for feature extraction from clinical color images, with application in classification of skin lesions. Proposed feature extraction method is based on tensor decomposition of the clinical color image of skin lesion. Since color image is naturally represented as a three-way tensor, it is reasonable to use multi-way techniques to capture the underlying information contained in the image. Extracted features are elements of the core tensor in the corresponding multi-way decomposition, and represent spatial-spectral profile of the lesion. In contrast to common methods that exploit either texture or spectral diversity of the tumor only, the proposed approach simultaneously captures spatial and spectral characteristics. The procedure is tested on a problem of noninvasive diagnosis of melanoma from the clinical color images of skin lesions, with overall sensitivity 82.1% and specificity 86.9%.

1009423,"In commenting on the review by Wacker and Witte [1], we would like to applaud the authors’ emphasis on the importance of being able to treat signals with time-varying properties: this feature is universal in time series derived from measurements on living systems. From a physics perspective, life always corresponds to a thermodynamically open system, for which energy and matter are being exchanged freely with the environment. Consequently, the oscillatory processes associated with life have natural frequencies and amplitudes that are continuously modulated by external influences. From the perspective of mathematics, they are non-autonomous oscillators and must be treated as such.The authors have provided a systematic review of the main methods currently available for timefrequency analysis of biomedical signals. The continuous wavelet transform has indeed been the main work-horse for the analysis of such time-series, ever since it was introduced for the study of oscillatory processes in eg heart rate variability [2, 3] and blood flow [4]; and the other methods reviewed [1] certainly have their merits. We would like to point out, however, that there are additional approaches of which the reader should also be aware.

This kind of algorithms leads to large matrices, and requires large memory for temporal variables. Hence decomposition of large-scale tensor is still a challenging problem for NTF.

The goal of BSS can be considered as estimation of true physical sources and parameters of a mixing system, while objective of GCA is finding a new reduced or hierarchical and structured representation for the observed (sensor) data that can be interpreted as physically meaningful coding or blind signal decompositions. The key issue is to find a such transformation or coding which has true physical meaning and interpretation.

For instance, when the solvability conditions are satisfied, it can be applied to cases in which: (i) the channel has zeros on the unit circle or outside of the unit circle; (ii) there are fewer sensors than sources; (iii) the source is temporarily dependent.

This is particularly advantageous when the levels of noise are high, the “active” channel changes its spatial location with time, and also for spatio-temporal processes where several channels contain meaningful information, such as in the case of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain activity monitoring. To provide insight into the dynamics of brain electrical responses, spatial sonification of multichannel EEG is performed, whereby the information from active channels is fused into music-like audio.

To fill this gap, we propose a deep nsNMF method coined by the fact that it possesses a deeper architecture compared with standard nsNMF. The deep nsNMF not only gives part-based features due to the nonnegativity constraints but also creates higher level, more abstract features by combing lower level ones.

They have emerged as alternatives to the traditional model-based approaches whenever the unknown dynamics are hard to characterize. Source separation has been at the heart of datadriven approaches and has found wide applicability in areas as diverse as biomedicine, communications, finance, geophysics, and remote sensing. Historically, the source separation problem has been posed with flexible and general assumptions and minimal priors, hence leading to the designation blind source separation (BSS). The first methodology for successful BSS was independent component analysis (ICA), and today, source separation includes a broader range of topics that emphasize incorporation of various priors and different types of decompositions to take the natural dimensionality of the observed data into account. New trends of research include the joint analysis of large-scale heterogeneous multidimensional sets of data, eg., associated to multimodal data acquisition as in hyperspectral or brain imaging. In addition, underdetermined problems, ie., those with a weak diversity and a large number of sources, are practically very interesting and can be solved through the use of additional priors such as sparsity.

The proposed method obtains the solution through maximization of a contrast function that exploits the similarity of the temporal envelope of the speech spectrum.

This parameterization is exploited to best measure the similarity of the speech spectrum and to obtain solutions that are robust against noise and outliers.

In order to take into account the underlying multimodes structure information within the model, we propose a framework of probabilistic product kernels for tensorial data based on a generative model assumption. More specifically, it can be interpreted as mapping tensors to probability density function space and measuring similarity by an information divergence. Since tensor kernels enable us to model input tensor observations, the proposed tensor-variate GP is considered as both a generative and discriminative model. Furthermore, a fully variational Bayesian treatment for multiclass GP classification with multinomial probit likelihood is employed to estimate the hyperparameters and infer the predictive distributions.

1009487,"We present an approach for blind separation of acoustic sources produced from multiple speakers mixed in realistic room environments. We first transform recorded signals into the time-frequency domain to make mixing become instantaneous. We then separate the sources in each frequency bin based on an independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm. For the present paper, we choose the complex version of fixedpoint iteration (CFPI), ie the complex version of FastICA, as the algorithm. From the separated signals in the time-frequency domain, we reconstruct output-separated signals in the time domain. To solve the so-called permutation problem due to the indeterminacy of permutation in the standard ICA, we propose a method that applies a special property of the CFPI cost function. Generally, the cost function has several optimal points that correspond to the different permutations of the outputs. These optimal points are isolated by some non-optimal regions of the cost function. In different but neighboring bins, optimal points with the same permutation are at almost the same position in the space of separation parameters. Based on this property, if an initial separation matrix for a learning process in a frequency bin is chosen equal to the final separation matrix of the learning process in the neighboring frequency bin, the learning process automatically leads us to separated signals with the same permutation as that of the neighbor frequency bin. In each bin, but except the starting one, by chosen the initial separation matrix in such a way, the permutation problem in the time domain reconstruction can be avoided.

1009497,"A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a setup permitting the control of external devices by decoding brain activity. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used for decoding brain activity since it is non-invasive, cheap, portable, and has high temporal resolution to allow real-time operation. Due to its poor spatial specificity, BCIs based on EEG can require extensive training and multiple trials to decode brain activity (consequently slowing down the operation of the BCI). On the other hand, BCIs based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are more accurate owing to its superior spatial resolution and sensitivity to underlying neuronal processes which are functionally localized. However, due to its relatively low temporal resolution, high cost, and lack of portability, fMRI is unlikely to be used for routine BCI.

To solve this problem, a novel visual-based BCI system based on covert attention and feature attention had been proposed and was called the gaze-independent BCI. Color and shape difference between stimuli and backgrounds have generally been used in examples of gaze-independent BCIs. Recently, a new paradigm based on facial expression change had been presented, and obtained high performance. However, some facial expressions were so similar that users couldn’t tell them apart. Especially they were presented at the same position in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. Consequently, the performance of BCIs is reduced. New Method: In this paper, we combined facial expressions and colors to optimize the stimuli presentation in the gaze-independent BCI. This optimized paradigm was called the colored dummy face pattern. It is suggested that different colors and facial expressions could help subjects to locate the target and evoke larger event-related potentials (ERPs). In order to evaluate the performance of this new paradigm, two other paradigms were presented, called the grey dummy face pattern and the colored ball pattern. Comparison with Existing Method(s): The key point that determined the value of the colored dummy faces stimuli in BCI systems were whether dummy face stimuli could obtain higher performance than grey faces or colored balls stimuli.

The criterion to judge performance of NMF and NTF is based on psychology knowledge of MMN and P3a. MMN is elicited by an oddball paradigm and may be proportionally modulated by the attention. So, participants are usually instructed to ignore the stimuli. However the deviant stimulus inevitably attracts some attention of the participant towards the stimuli. Thus, P3a often follows MMN. As a result, if P3a was larger, it could mean that more attention would be attracted by the deviant stimulus, and then MMN could be enlarged.

1009550,"We propose new algorithms for singular value decomposition (SVD) of very large-scale matrices based on a low-rank tensor approximation technique called the tensor train (TT) format. The proposed algorithms can compute several dominant singular values and corresponding singular vectors for large-scale structured matrices given in a TT format. The computational complexity of the proposed methods scales logarithmically with the matrix size under the assumption that both the matrix and the singular vectors admit low-rank TT decompositions. The proposed methods, which are called the alternating least squares for SVD (ALS-SVD) and modified alternating least squares for SVD (MALS-SVD), compute the left and right singular vectors approximately through block TT decompositions. The very large-scale optimization problem is reduced to sequential small-scale optimization problems, and each core tensor of the block TT decompositions can be updated by applying any standard optimization methods. The optimal ranks of the block TT decompositions are determined adaptively during iteration process, so that we can achieve high approximation accuracy. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted for several types of TT-structured matrices such as Hilbert matrix, Toeplitz matrix, random matrix with prescribed singular values, and tridiagonal matrix. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared with standard SVD algorithms and TT-based algorithms developed for symmetric eigenvalue decomposition.",Namgil Lee and Andrzej Cichocki,8,16414412273415296628,arXiv preprint arXiv:1410.6895,,,,Very large-scale singular value decomposition using tensor train networks,https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6895,,2014,/scholar?cites=16414412273415296628,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:beqBT5984LEC

This method allowed us to improve signal analysis, by accessing EEG prominent activities on a trial-by-trial basis; which in turn allowed us to access reliably specific signatures in LFP and EEG signals (1, 2).

1009575,"Alternative least squares (ALS) algorithm is considered as a “work-horse” algorithm for general tensor factorizations. A common form of this algorithm for nonnegative tensor factorizations (NTF) is always combined with a nonlinear projection (rectifier) to enforce nonnegative entries during the estimation. Such simple modification often provides acceptable results for general data. However, this does not establish an appropriate ALS algorithm for NTF. This kind of ALS algorithm often converges slowly, or cannot converge to the desired solution, especially for collinear data. To this end, in this paper, we reinvestigate the nonnegative quadratic programming, propose a recursive method for solving this problem. Then, we formulate a novel ALS algorithm for NTF.

1009596,"The paper presents a novel model for classification of EEG data based on independent component analysis (ICA) as a feature extraction technique, and on evolving fuzzy neural networks–as a classification modeling technique. One of the problems in such models is that some of EEG channels and model variables are redundant,‘noisy’, and have a detrimental effect on the performance of the whole system. Here the problem of removing the ‘noisy’independent components is explored through applying an exhaustive a-posteriori search algorithm. In the experiment performed and reported in the paper single trial EEG data from four different stimulus conditions are transformed into independent components via ICA. One-by-one, individual independent components from each possible pairing of the stimuli are suppressed and the residual data are projected, through the estimated mixing matrix, back to the EEG electrodes. Feature vectors are extracted from the resulting data and are used to train and test a two-class EFuNN classifier. The independent components whose suppression leads to the best performance enhancement are considered to be the noise components. After all six possible pairings of the four stimuli have been used, the identified noise components are removed from the data and, after a back-projection and feature extraction, the residual data is used to train and test a four class EFuNN.

1009633,"Different non-invasive brain imaging techniques are presently available to provide images of the human functional cortical activity, based on hemodynamic metabolic or electromagnetic measurements. However, static images of brain regions activated during particular tasks do not convey the information of how these regions communicate with each other. Cortical connectivity estimation aims at describing these interactions as connectivity patterns which hold the direction and strength of the information flow between cortical areas. So far, the causality between brain signals has been assessed by using the time-varying information derived from hemodynamic or electromagnetic signals recorded at the scalp or cortical level. However, the causality estimation from these brain functional waveforms will depict a single pattern of connectivity involving several brain areas, for each time segment or in every frequency band analyzed. Since it is well known that the brain does not produce any “single waveform” but rather engages several distributed cortical areas in order to process information, a question arose about the appropriateness of the estimation of the functional connectivity between waveforms. In particular, the question is whether instead of estimating the causality between single waveforms derived from the different cortical or scalp areas it is possible to estimate the causality between “spatial patterns of brain cortical activations”. In fact, it is reasonable to pose the question if it could be more interesting to estimate the causality (in the sense of the Granger) between the activation of distributed cortical systems or just observe the causality between …",Hovagim Bakardjian and Andrzej Cichocki and Febo Cincotti and Donatella Mattia and Fabio Babiloni and M Grazia Marciani and F De Vico Fallani and Fumikazu Miwakeichi and Yoko Yamaguchi and Pablo Martinez and Serenella Salinari and Andrea Tocci and Laura Astolfi,6,8047606251047292644,International Journal of Bioelectromagnetism,1,II/1-II/18,,Estimate of causality between cortical spatial patterns during voluntary movements in normal subjects,http://www.ijbem.org/volume8/number1/2-19.htm,8,2006,/scholar?cites=8047606251047292644,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC

We first apply a robust independent component analysis (ICA) approach to the observed sensor signals for the separation of the superimposed EP signals. Next, the desired EP components are estimated by matched-filtering of the separated signals. The impulse response of such a matched filter can be computed based on third-order cumulants of the filter input signal. Therefore, due to the tolerance of the third-order cumulants to both Gaussian and any symmetrically distributed non-Gaussian noise or interference, the filter impulse response will be matched with the desired signal alone.

The problem of the curse of dimensionality in such solutions is also analyzed. The authors consider the cases in which deep networks are guaranteed to avoid the curse of dimensionality. They argue that the key aspect of convolutional networks is the locality at each level of layered signal processing. Paper [3], co-authored by A. Novikov, M. Trofimov, and I. Oseledets, introduces the so-called exponential machines, serving as a predictor that models the interactions between features of any orders. The main idea is to represent the exponentially large tensor of parameters in a factorized format known as the tensor train. The tensor train format regularizes the model and allows to control the number of underlying parameters. The stochastic Riemannian optimization procedure was developed to train the model.Paper [4], by V. Lebedev and V. Lempitsky, deals with a very important problem of speeding-up computation in convolutional neural networks, required due to the very large size of such architectures. Several research directions for speeding up CNNs have been presented and discussed. They include tensor decompositions, weight quantization, weight pruning and teacher-student approaches.

1009657,"Digital mammography is one of the most widely used approaches for breast cancer diagnosis. Many researchers have demonstrated the superiority of machine learning methods in breast cancer diagnosis using different mammography databases. Since these methods often have different pros and cons, which may confuse doctors and researchers, an elaborate comparison and examination among them is urgently needed for practical breast cancer diagnosis. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative study of the state-of-the-art machine learning methods that are promising in breast cancer diagnosis. For this purpose we analyze the largest mammography diagnosis database: Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). We considered various approaches for feature extraction including principal component analysis (PCA), nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), spatial-temporal discriminant analysis (STDA) and those for classification including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), random forests (RaF), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), as well as deep learning methods including convolutional neural networks (CNN) and stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE).

1009658,"Reducing noise in a video sequence is of vital important in many real-world applications. One popular method is block matching collaborative filtering. However, the main drawback of this method is that noise standard deviation for the whole video sequence is known in advance. In this paper, we present a tensor based denoising framework that considers 3D patches instead of 2D patches. By collecting the similar 3D patches non-locally, we employ the low-rank tensor decomposition for collaborative filtering. Since we specify the non-informative prior over the noise precision parameter, the noise variance can be inferred automatically from observed video data. Therefore, our method is more practical, which does not require knowing the noise variance.

It is shown that if a fast sampling rate is used to obtain the discrete time observed data, learning to solve blind source separation and deconvolution tasks can be very difficult. This is due to the data covariance matrix becoming almost singular. We propose a discrete time model based on alternative discrete time operators which is capable of overcoming the problems and giving significantly improved performance under the conditions described.",Andrew D Back and Andrzej Cichocki,5,13740494583638170578,,,637-640,,Blind Source Separation and Deconvolution of Fast Sampled Signals.,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e23c/ace388483003432faef5b3107df37c0638f0.pdf,,1997,/scholar?cites=13740494583638170578,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:GFxP56DSvIMC

Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of MI-based BCI-feedback training in post-stroke rehabilitation.

At first, multi-way delay embedding transform (MDT) is employed to represent time series as low-rank block Hankel tensors (BHT). Then, the higher-order tensors are projected to compressed core tensors by applying Tucker decomposition. At the same time, the generalized tensor Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is explicitly used on consecutive core tensors to predict future samples. In this manner, the proposed approach tactically incorporates the unique advantages of MDT tensorization (to exploit mutual correlations) and tensor ARIMA coupled with low-rank Tucker decomposition into a unified framework. This framework exploits the low-rank structure of block Hankel tensors in the embedded space and captures the intrinsic correlations among multiple TS, which thus can improve the forecasting results, especially for multiple short time series.

1009696,"Estimating cognitive or affective states from brain signals is a key but challenging step in the creation of passive brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. So far, estimating mental workload or emotions from EEG signals is only feasible with modest classification accuracies, thus leading to unreliable neuroadaptive applications. However, recent machine learning algorithms, notably Riemannian geometry based classifiers (RGC) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), have shown to be promising for other BCI systems, eg, motor imagery-BCIs. However, they have not been formally studied and compared together for cognitive or affective states classification. This paper thus explores such machine learning algorithms, proposes new variants of them, and benchmarks them with classical methods to estimate both mental workload and affective states (Valence/Arousal) from EEG signals. We study these approaches with both subject-specific and subject-independent calibration, to go towards calibration-free systems. Our results suggested that a CNN obtained the highest mean accuracy, although not significantly so, in both conditions for the mental workload study, followed by RGCs. However, this same CNN underperformed in both conditions for the emotion data set, a data set with small training data. On the contrary, RGCs proved to have the highest mean accuracy with the Filter Bank Tangent Space classifier (FBTSC) we introduced in this paper. Our results thus contributed to improve the reliability of cognitive and affective states classification from EEG. They also provide guidelines about when to use which machine learning algorithm.",Aurélien Appriou and Andrzej Cichocki and Fabien Lotte,4,3659919385448352389,"IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Magazine",,,,Modern machine learning algorithms to classify cognitive and affective states from electroencephalography signals,https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02483908/file/IEEE_system_man_cybernetics_new.pdf,,2020,/scholar?cites=3659919385448352389,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:MUibKfyVdmgC

1009721,"Humans interact with the environment by gathering information through multiple afferent sensory channels. That is why the efficient compression and blending of the information flow from different sensory modalities used by the extensive cortical networks in the human brain for decision making is vital for immediate reaction and survival in humans and animals. In spite of numerous studies available to date, including electroencephalographic (EEG) studies [1], the exact time course of the early interplay between the sensor-specific cortices, as well as between them and the prefrontal cortex, still remains a significant challenge. One of the reasons for that lack of knowledge is the diversity of multimodal responses and pathways, recruited specifically as the result of factors such as stimulus type (speech, touch, smell, vision) and characteristics (saliency, sparsity, synchronization, spatial separation, degree of conflict). Factors like anticipation and attention [2] could also influence the responses strongly. Multimodal interactions in the brain have been shown to involve both enhancement [3] and inhibition [4], depending on the afferent stimuli, activating regions from the insula and the superior colliculus to the right temporo-parietal junction and the anterior ectosylvian sulcus [5].

To date, many researchers have designed optimized visual paradigms based on the face stimuli to elicit ERPs during BCI control. These ERPs are not limited to P300 components and also include other types of ERP, which are used to improve the performance of system. Additionally, previous studies have also shown that color stimuli may be used to improve the performance of ERP-based BCIs.

In this paper trading on the stock exchange is interpreted into a game with a Markov property consisting of states, actions, and rewards. A system for trading the fixed volume of a financial instrument is proposed and experimentally tested; this is based on the asynchronous advantage actor-critic method with the use of several neural network architectures.

1009742,"Canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition is an important task in many applications. Many times, the true tensor rank is not known, or noise is present, and in such situations, different existing CP decomposition algorithms provide very different results. In this letter, we introduce a notion of  sensitivity  of CP decomposition and suggest to use it as a side criterion (besides the fitting error) to evaluate different CP decomposition results. Next, we propose a novel variant of a Krylov-Levenberg-Marquardt CP decomposition algorithm which may serve for CP decomposition with a constraint on the sensitivity. In simulations, we decompose order-4 tensors that come from convolutional neural networks. We show that it is useful to combine the CP decomposition algorithms with an error-preserving correction.",Petr Tichavský and Anh-Huy Phan and Andrzej Cichocki,3,605818033317863322,IEEE Signal Processing Letters,11,1653-1657,IEEE,Sensitivity in Tensor Decomposition,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8846103/,26,2019,/scholar?cites=605818033317863322,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:Yp96WNAcdNsC

1009745,"Electroencephalography (EEG) signals may provide abundant information reflecting the developmental changes in brain status. It usually takes a long time to finally judge whether a brain is dead, so an effective pre-test of brain states method is needed. In this paper, we present a hybrid processing pipeline to differentiate brain death and coma patients based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of power spectral density, complexity features, and feature fusion for group analysis. In addition, time-varying power spectrum and complexity were observed based on the analysis of individual patients, which can be used to monitor the change of brain status over time. Results showed three major differences between brain death and coma groups of EEG signal: slowing, increased complexity, and the improvement on classification accuracy with feature fusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme for joint general analysis and time-varying state monitoring. Delta-band relative power spectrum density and permutation entropy could effectively be regarded as potential features of discrimination analysis on brain death and coma patients.

In a practical BCI system, the whole segment of EEG is discarded when a portion of that segment is contaminated by extreme noise or artifacts. This leads to the weakness that the BCI system cannot output decoding results during the period of that discarded segment.

Musical training has structural and functional effects on the brain.

Electroencephalography was performed using a 60-channel electrode cap. Morlet wavelet time-frequency analysis was performed and root mean square was calculated for each frequency band. RESULTS: During music listening, gamma activity (30 to 50 Hz) was significantly decreased in all regions, especially the prefrontal cortex. During music imaging, gamma activity was significantly decreased in the entire brain in musicians, but was increased in the frontal lobe in non-musicians.CONCLUSIONS: Musicians have significantly lower frontal gamma activity during music listening and music imaging than resting state, possibly due to a trained ability to integrate implicit memory from acoustic memory and direct inner consciousness toward selfreference and attention.

1009767,"NONLINEAR signal processing using neural networks inherited the dominant mean-squared error criteria from linear adaptive filtering theory due to a number of appealing properties exhibited by second-order statistical optimality criteria under the linear model. In linear filtering of Gaussian distributed signals, second order statistics such as variance and correlation completely describe the data distribution and their interactions. In the nonlinear model framework, where signals are not normally Gaussian distributed, this is not the case anymore.As the goal of adaptive system’s training is to transfer onto the parameters of the nonlinear model as much information as possible about the signals’ underlying statistical and dynamical structure, one certainly needs to consider the higher order statistics of the data. Descriptors used to quantify information, such as entropy and divergence (or its special case, mutual information) appear as leading candidates to build this new information theoretic criteria. The process of designing optimal signal processing filters based on information theoretic criteria is referred to as information theoretic filtering (ITF) and the process of learning or adaptation with the new cost function is named information theoretic learning (ITL).

1009796,"Objective: Schizophrenia seriously affects the quality of life. To date, both simple (linear discriminant analysis) and complex (deep neural network) machine learning methods have been utilized to identify schizophrenia based on functional connectivity features. The existing simple methods need two separate steps (ie, feature extraction and classification) to achieve the identification, which disables simultaneous tuning for the best feature extraction and classifier training. The complex methods integrate two steps and can be simultaneously tuned to achieve optimal performance, but these methods require a much larger amount of data for model training. Methods: To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, we proposed a multi-kernel capsule network (MKCapsnet), which was developed by considering the brain anatomical structure. Kernels were set to match with partition sizes of brain anatomical structure in order to capture interregional connectivities at the varying scales. With the inspiration of widely-used dropout strategy in deep learning, we developed vector dropout in the capsule layer to prevent overfitting of the model. Results: The comparison results showed that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we compared performances using different parameters and illustrated the routing process to reveal characteristics of the proposed method. Conclusion: MKCapsnet is promising for schizophrenia identification. Significance: Our study not only proposed a multi-kernel capsule network but also provided useful information in the parameter setting, which is informative for further studies using a capsule network …",Tian Wang and Anastasios Bezerianos and Andrzej Cichocki and Junhua Li,2,10060631948667340465,arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.12827,,,,Multi-Kernel Capsule Network for Schizophrenia Identification,https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12827,,2019,/scholar?cites=10060631948667340465,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:oG-63-_xH24C

In previous studies, a flip stimulus (rotating the background area of the character) that was based on apparent motion, suffered from less refractory effects. However, its performance was not improved significantly. In addition, a presentation paradigm that used a “zooming” action (changing the size of the symbol) has been shown to evoke relatively higher P300 amplitudes and obtain a better BCI performance.

Wherein, BEEG contains one's unique intrinsic brainprint, which was supposed to be a low-rank characteristic. To analyse more precisely, short time Fourier Transform (STFT) are exerted to expand time series EEG into time-frequency domain.

1009802,"Canonical polyadic decomposition of tensor is to approximate or express the tensor by sum of rank-1 tensors. When all or almost all components of factor matrices of the tensor are highly collinear, the decomposition becomes difficult. Algorithms, e.g., the alternating algorithms, require plenty of iterations, and may get stuck in false local minima. This paper proposes a novel method for such decompositions. The method injects one or a few rank-1 tensors into the data tensor in order to control the decompositions of the rank-expanded data, while still preserving the estimation accuracy of the original tensor. To achieve this, we develop a method to automatically generate the injected tensor which satisfies a specific estimation accuracy such that this tensor should not dominate rank-1 tensors of the data tensor, but is still able to be retrieved with a sufficient accuracy.

1009809,"Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals are generally non-stationary, however, nearly stationary brain responses, such as steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), can be recorded in response to repetitive stimuli. Although Fourier transform has precise resolution with long time windows (5 or 10 s for instance) to extract SSVEP response (1-100 Hz ranges), its resolution with shorter windows decreases due to the Heisenberg-Gabor uncertainty principle. Therefore, it is not easy to extract evoked responses such as SSVEP within short EEG epochs. This limits the information transfer rate of SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces. In order to circumvent this limitation, we concatenate EEG signals recorded simultaneously from different channels, and we Fourier analyze the resulting sequence. From this constructed signal, high frequency resolution can be obtained with time epochs as small as only 1 s, which improves SSVEPs classification.

As the technology has matured in recent years, more emphasis will be given to applications for healthy users, in addition to its vital basic function to help disabled subjects. A noninvasive approach based on EEG with only a few sensors has been very successful. Even though BMI communication can be achieved in a number of ways, either by using brain responses to externally-driven stimulation, or by recognition of internal brain states, each approach has its own advantages and shortfalls. One BMI paradigm which has the potential to offer superior recognition performance and high number of independent commands is the Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) approach.

1009853,"In our previous studies several interesting dynamic phenomena have been discovered in chaotic neural networks with third-order continuous-time neurons. The considered network had only local interactions between the nodes. Depending on the connection structure and initial conditions imposed (which can be considered as external stimulation) for each neuron the array exhibits various kinds of spatially ordered chaotic waves: target waves, checkerboard patterns, auto-wave-like behavior and spatial memory effect. The patterns with visible spatial regularity (as opposed to spatial chaos) emerging from cooperation of a large number of chaotic dynamic elements are referred to as self-organization.

1009872,"Mapping brain dynamics into mental states to understand behavior [1] and describing social interactions between people [2] is a great challenge for physics of complex systems. During resting state, when people are not performing any specific tasks, different quasi-stable networks can be extracted from the functional Magnetic Resonance (fMRI) recordings of the human brain signals [3]. Moreover, different brain regions have natural frequencies of oscillations coupling cortex and thalamus structures (corticothalamic loops). This has been shown by perturbing selected corticothalamic loops using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and analyzing high-density electroencephalograms to measure their natural frequency [4]. Such functional coupling patterns across distributed brain regions have stable core features for various task states, ranging from simple passive fixation to complex classification tasks [5]. These large-scale networks may also be activated during longer resting-state activity, reflecting the functional architecture of cortical networks [6] and thus can serve as a starting point for the analysis of general brain function.One way to see fingerprints of individual brain areas activity, developed recently by Keitel and Gross [7], is based on the local power spectra. Spectral fingerprints were obtained from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings in the resting state.

1009876,"The gait patterns of older adults were measured and analyzed to develop a practical device to reduce the risk of falls. The gait measurements were performed on healthy older adults (n= 28) aged over 55 during usual walking using an optical motion capture system and an inertial measurement unit with a 3-axis gyro sensor and a 3-axis accelerometer placed on the hip over the sacrum. Various stages of gait patterns were investigated to estimate and compare participants’ feet trajectories and body movements. Chronological age did not correlate with minimum foot clearance (MFC) during the swing phase (correlation coefficient, r= 0.22, p> 0.05) as an index of the risk of fall. Significant correlations were found between MFC and waist rotation along the rostro-caudal axis (yawing, r= 0.40, p< 0.05), between waist rotation and body mass index (r=-0.44, p< 0.05), and between one-leg standing duration (OLSD) and waist rotation along the anteriorposterior axis (rolling, r= 0.44, p< 0.05). MFC and OLSD were not significantly correlated (r= 0.16, p> 0.05), suggesting their independence.

1009878,"In CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor decomposition, degeneracy often occurs in some difficult scenarios, eg, when the rank exceeds the tensor dimension, or when the loading components are highly collinear in several or all modes, or when CPD does not have an optimal solution. In such the cases, norms of some rank-1 terms become significantly large and cancel each other. This makes algorithms getting stuck in local minima while running a huge number of iterations does not improve the decomposition. In this paper, we propose an error preservation correction method to deal with such problem. Our aim is to seek a new tensor whose norms of rank-1 tensor components are minimised in an optimization problem, while it preserves the approximation error. An alternating correction algorithm and an all-atone algorithm have been developed for the problem. In addition, we propose a novel CPD with a bound constraint on a norm of the rank-one tensors.

1009880,We propose a new method for computing low-rank approximations of Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses (MPPs) of large-scale matrices using tensor networks. The computed pseudoinverses can be useful for solving or preconditioning large-scale overdetermined or underdetermined systems of linear equations. The computation is performed efficiently and stably based on the modified alternating least squares (MALS) scheme using low-rank TT decomposition. The large-scale optimization problem is reduced to sequential smaller-scale problems for which any standard and stable algorithms can be applied. Regularization technique is further introduced in order to alleviate illconditioning and obtain low-rank solutions. Numerical simulation results illustrate that the pseudoinverses of a wide class of non-square or non-symmetric matrices admit good approximate low-rank TT approximations. It is demonstrated that the computational cost of the proposed method is only logarithmic in the matrix size given that the TT-ranks of a data matrix and its approximate pseudoinverse are bounded. It is illustrated that a strongly non-symmetric convection-diffusion problem can be efficiently solved by using the preconditioners computed by the proposed method.,Namgil Lee and Andrzej Cichocki,1,12409549243093193470,arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.01959,,,,Regularized Computation of Approximate Pseudoinverse of Matrices Using Low-Rank Tensor Train Decompositions,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrzej_Cichocki2/publication/277895438_Regularized_Computation_of_Approximate_Pseudoinverse_of_Matrices_Using_Low-Rank_Tensor_Train_Decompositions/links/566803da08aea62726ef7352.pdf,,2015,/scholar?cites=12409549243093193470,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:8Em2iVsdh7EC

1009905,"It is well known that the electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are useful techniques for the study of brain dynamics, due to their high temporal resolution. However, it is known that the spatial resolution of the standard EEG is rather low, due to the different electrical conductivities of brain, skull, and scalp that markedly blur the EEG potential distributions, making the localization of the underlying cortical generators problematic. In the last ten years, a body of mathematical techniques, known as high-resolution EEG, was developed to estimate more precisely the cortical activity from non-invasive EEG measurements. Such techniques include the use of a large number of scalp electrodes, realistic models of the head derived from magnetic resonance images (MRIs), and advanced processing methodologies related to the solution of the so-called “inverse problem,” that is, the estimation of the brain activity (ie, electromagnetic generators) from the EEG/MEG measurements. The approach implies both the use of thousands of equivalent current dipoles as a source model and the realistic head models, reconstructed from magnetic resonance images, as the volume conductor medium. The use of geometrical constraints on the position of the neural source or sources within the head model generally reduces the solution space (ie, the set of all possible combinations of the cortical dipoles strengths). An additional constraint is to force the dipoles to explain the recorded data with a minimum or a low amount of energy (minimum-norm solutions).

It has been suggested that the BP is able to produce neuronal change and thus level of consciousness of the human brain. The EEG signal recorded over the surface of the scalp is the result of the synchronized activities of neurons in the cortex. It is the combination of such neuronal oscillators that results into different spontaneous cognitive activities of the brain. Thus finding the locations of such neuronal sources in the cortex is important and can be performed using source localization techniques. The source identification was performed on band-passed (0-35 Hz and 35 Hz to 80 Hz) EEG data for both the pre-BP and BP conditions.

Because more than 50% of the states in the United States have at least one place called “Brighton,” for many delegates, the stay was really like a home away from home. For those interested in heritage, there were more than 3,360 listed buildings in Brighton and Hove, more than 500 to choose from for every day of ICASSP.

1009959,"The central task in graph-based unsupervised feature selection (GUFS) depends on two folds, one is to accurately characterize the geometrical structure of the original feature space with a graph and the other is to make the selected features well preserve such intrinsic structure. Currently, most of the existing GUFS methods use a two-stage strategy which constructs graph first and then perform feature selection on this fixed graph. Since the performance of feature selection severely depends on the quality of graph, the selection results will be unsatisfactory if the given graph is of low-quality. To this end, we propose a joint graph learning and unsupervised feature selection (JGUFS) model in which the graph can be adjusted to adapt the feature selection process. The JGUFS objective function is optimized by an efficient iterative algorithm whose convergence and complexity are analyzed in detail.

Despite enormous diversity in physical and physiological signal generating mechanisms in such applications, the mathematical background at the core of the majority of signal detection, estimation, classification or fusion algorithms is common to most practical applications, both current and future. It is important to note that we consider the notion of signals in a general sense, to include not only signals processed and manipulated by computers or smart devices but also by means of biological systems such as our brains. Such biological systems process information from sensors in an intelligent way to perform even the most complex of tasks such as recognizing objects, sounds, and taste or smooth navigation in complex and cluttered environments.

One of many potential causes could be that for many first time users, performing MI is new and difficult, and can thus lead to unclear MI EEG patterns. Therefore, calibrating an MI-BCI on such unclear EEG examples can lead to suboptimal EEG features and BCIs.

Traditional methods of canonical polyadic decomposition of such tensors, namely the alternating least squares, can be used, but a presence of a large number of false local minima can make the problem hard. Usually, multiple random initializations are advised in such cases, but the question is how many such random initializations are sufficient to get a good chance of finding the right solution.

For this study the input face set was a 4-D array, with two spatial dimensions, color the third dimension, and the population of different faces forming the fourth dimension.

This study aimed to elucidate the prediction of conversion to AD and cognitive decline by FA values in uncinate fasciculus (UF) in aMCI patients.METHODS Twenty-two aMCI patients were evaluated for their UF FA values by a tractography-based method with DTI and cognitive performance by neuropsychological testing at baseline and after a 3-year follow-up. Patients were divided into 2 groups after 3 years: 14 aMCI-stable (aMCI-aMCI) and 8 AD-conversion (aMCI-AD).",Kazuko Hiyoshi-Taniguchi and Naoya Oishi and Chihiro Namiki and Jun Miyata and Toshiya Murai and Andrzej Cichocki and Hidenao Fukuyama,0,,,,,,Clinical Investigative Study,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.725.5254&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,2014,,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:I9VVr87FQe4C

1009987,"Tensors are a generalization of vectors and matrices to higher dimensions that can naturally represent the multidimensional structured data. Based on multilinear algebra, tensor factorizations enable us to effectively capture the hidden structure of the data, which is usually available as a priori information on the data nature. Hence it attracts much interest on unsupervised learning and data exploratory. In this paper, we firstly present some basic concept of tensor factorization and multilinear algebra, then a novel framework for tensor variate Gaussian processes (GP) regression is introduced, which exploits a covariance function defined on tensor representation of data inputs. In this way, we bring together the powerful GP methods supported by Bayesian inference and higher-order tensor analysis techniques into one framework. This enables us to account for the underlying data structure within the model, providing a powerful framework for structural data analysis, such as 3D video sequences.

1009989,"A novel near-lossless compression algorithm for multichannel electroencephalogram (MC-EEG) is proposed based on matrix/tensor decomposition models. MC-EEG is represented in suitable multiway (multidimensional) forms to efficiently exploit temporal and spatial correlations simultaneously. Several matrix/tensor decomposition models are analyzed in view of efficient decorrelation of the multiway forms of MC-EEG. A compression algorithm is built based on the principle of “lossy plus residual coding,” consisting of a matrix/tensor decomposition-based coder in the lossy layer followed by arithmetic coding in the residual layer. This approach guarantees a specifiable maximum absolute error between original and reconstructed signals. The compression algorithm is applied to three different scalp EEG datasets and an intracranial EEG dataset, each with different sampling rate and resolution. The proposed algorithm achieves attractive compression ratios compared to compressing individual channels separately. For similar compression ratios, the proposed algorithm achieves nearly fivefold lower average error compared to a similar wavelet-based volumetric MC-EEG compression algorithm.",K Srinivasan and Justin Dauwels and M Ramasubba Reddy and Andrzej Cichocki,0,,,,,,Near-lossless multichannel EEG compression based on matrix and tensor decompositions,https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/101371,,2013,,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:fNcQ33DWWncC

1010000,"Several clinical studies have reported that EEG synchrony is affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this paper a frequency band analysis of AD EEG signals is presented, with the aim of improving the diagnosis of AD using EEG signals. In this paper, multiple synchrony measures are assessed through statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U test), including correlation, phase synchrony and Granger causality measures. Moreover, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is conducted with those synchrony measures as features. For the data set at hand, the frequency range (5-6Hz) yields the best accuracy for diagnosing AD, which lies within the classical theta band (4-8Hz). The corresponding classification error is 4.88% for directed transfer function (DTF) Granger causality measure. Interestingly, results show that EEG of AD patients is more synchronous than in healthy subjects within the optimized range 5-6Hz, which is in sharp contrast with the loss of synchrony in AD EEG reported in many earlier studies. This new finding may provide new insights about the neurophysiology of AD.

In the second stage, the residual is quantized and coded. Through such two-stage approach, one can control the maximum error (worst-case distortion).

1010010,"Medical studies have shown that EEG of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is “slower” (i.e., contains more low-frequency power) and is less complex compared to age-matched healthy subjects. The relation between those two phenomena has not yet been studied, and they are often silently assumed to be independent. In this paper, it is shown that both phenomena are strongly related. Strong correlation between slowing and loss of complexity is observed in two independent EEG datasets: (1) EEG of predementia patients (a.k.a. Mild Cognitive Impairment; MCI) and control subjects; (2) EEG of mild AD patients and control subjects. The two data sets are from different patients, different hospitals and obtained through different recording systems. The paper also investigates the potential of EEG slowing and loss of EEG complexity as indicators of AD onset. In particular, relative power and complexity measures are used as features to classify the MCI and MiAD patients versus age-matched control subjects. When combined with two synchrony measures (Granger causality and stochastic event synchrony), classification rates of 83% (MCI) and 98% (MiAD) are obtained.

This work aimed at using the multiway array decomposition (MAD) method to extract discriminative features from electroencephalograms (EEGs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We applied modified versions of three MAD methods (ie the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), Tucker3 model, and nonnegative tensor decomposition (NTD)) to multi-site recorded EEGs in AD and age-and sex-matched healthy subjects. Feedforward multilayer Perceptron was used and trained to validate and optimize for classification of AD using two independent EEG databases. We showed, using another independent EEG dataset, that the MAD approach exhibited larger than 90% of classification accuracy for AD, which outperformed supervised spectral-spatial filters or other previous conventional EEG analyses.",Charles-Francois Vincent Latchoumane and Francois-Benois Vialatte and Andrzej Cichocki and Jaeseung Jeong,0,,,,958-963,APSIPA ASC,Multiway Array Decomposition Analysis for Classification of Alzheimer’s disease,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles-Francois_Vincent_Latchoumane/publication/289206429_Multiway_array_decomposition_analysis_for_classification_of_Alzheimer's_disease/links/58ef3134a6fdcc61cc1287e0/Multiway-array-decomposition-analysis-for-classification-of-Alzheimers-disease.pdf,,2010,,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:71d7Y1FijdoC

False positive errors are critical in this application. To reduce false positive errors, we develop a nonparametric classifier based on convex hulls. Compared to existing linear binary classifiers, we show that the convex hull-based classifier easily removes ambiguous regions on a feature space determined by common spatial patterns, which result in false positive and negative errors.

1010021,"We propose a new procedure for fast and robust extraction of the Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) for an asynchronous multi-command Brain Computer Interface (BCI). The SSVEPs were elicited by means of small reversal flickering checkerboards displayed on a monitor screen. In order to extract the SSVEPs we applied a new algorithm based on Constrained Independent Component Analysis with references (CICAr). A set of references defined as rectangular half-cycle-square periodic signals with the same frequencies as the frequencies of the flickering checkerboards were added into equality and inequality constraints, in order to extract in each moment the stronger elicited SSVEP activities. The final decision stage of the BCI system is performed by means of multiple statistical tests using surrogate data to contrast the reliability of the extracted SSVEPs by the CICAr algorithm, achieving a good discrimination when a subject is gazing or not gazing at a checkerboard. The proposed procedure does not require a classifier; therefore, it is not necessary to perform any calibration or training session to tune any classifier parameter, hence a plug and play BCI system. The algorithm has been tested with recorded EEG data of 4 healthy subjects from previously published real-time SSVEP-based BCI experiments.

In this paper, it is explored whether loss in EEG synchrony can be used to diagnose AD at an early stage.

It is observed that both Granger causality and stochastic event synchrony indicate statistically significant loss of EEG synchrony, for the two data sets; those two synchrony measures are then combined as features in linear and quadratic discriminant analysis (with crossvalidation), yielding classification rates of 83% and 88% for the pre-dementia data set and mild AD data set respectively.

1010054,Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from eight Japanese speakers while they listened to Japanese and Spanish sentences (approximately 51 s each). The sentences were modulated in amplitude by a binary m-sequence and played forward or backward. A circular cross-correlation function was computed between the EEG signals and the m-sequence and averaged across subjects. Independent component analysis of the averaged function revealed a component source response which was obtained only for the comprehensible Japanese and not for the incomprehensible sentences. The present study has thus shown that a one-minute-long EEG signal is sufficient for the assessment of speech comprehension.,Hiroshige Takeichi and S Koyama and A Matani and A Cichocki,0,,International Congress Series,,83-86,Elsevier,Speech comprehension assessed by electroencephalography with m-sequence technique,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0531513107000593,1301,2007,,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:pYKElYtJMmwC

1010055,Studies using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) have reported electrophysiological responses to semantically and/or grammatically anomalous words embedded in a sentence for decades. Here we have successfully developed a technique with which we can objectively estimate the level of listeners' speech comprehension using continuous speech sounds without linguistic anomalies. We used minute-long speech sounds whose amplitudes were modulated by an m-sequence (pseudorandom binary sequence). Eelectroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from Japanese speakers and were cross-correlated with the m-sequence. We identified a signal peak which was found only for comprehensible but not for incomprehensible (backward-played Japanese and Spanish) speech stimuli in an independent component cross-correlation function. The correlation time of the signal peak was 400 ms and the peak …,Hiroshige Takeichi and Sachiko Koyama and Andrzej Cichocki,0,,,,1531-1534,IEEE,Measuring Sentence Processing by Electroencephalography (EEG): New Technique Using M-Sequence Modulation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4382003/,,2007,,wpZDx1cAAAAJ:ndLnGcHYRF0C

Then we present iterative algorithms for the IRE minimization, through the projection approximation.
