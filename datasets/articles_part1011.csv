1011000,"Correlating the activation foci identified in functional imaging studies of the human brain with structural (e.g., cytoarchitectonic) information on the activated areas is a major methodological challenge for neuroscience research. We here present a new approach to make use of three-dimensional probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps, as obtained from the analysis of human post-mortem brains, for correlating microscopical, anatomical and functional imaging data of the cerebral cortex. We introduce a new, MATLAB based toolbox for the SPM2 software package which enables the integration of probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps and results of functional imaging studies. The toolbox includes the functionality for the construction of summary maps combining probability of several cortical areas by finding the most probable assignment of each voxel to one of these areas. Its main feature is to provide several measures …",Simon B Eickhoff and Klaas E Stephan and Hartmut Mohlberg and Christian Grefkes and Gereon R Fink and Katrin Amunts and Karl Zilles,3487,11463033453410128722,Neuroimage,4,1325-1335,Academic Press,A new SPM toolbox for combining probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps and functional imaging data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381190400792X,25,2005,/scholar?cites=11463033453410128722,wjpISMAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C

ALE assesses the overlap between foci based on modeling them as probability distributions centered at the respective coordinates. In this Human Brain Project/Neuroinformatics research, the authors present a revised ALE algorithm addressing drawbacks associated with former implementations. The first change pertains to the size of the probability distributions, which had to be specified by the used. To provide a more principled solution, the authors analyzed fMRI data of 21 subjects, each normalized into MNI space using nine different approaches.

Nevertheless, questions concerning which areas consistently contribute to these networks irrespective of the particular experimental design and how such processing may be lateralized remain unresolved. The current study aimed at identifying cortical areas consistently involved in action observation and imitation by combining activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis with probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps.

1011003,"Several recent reports in large, independent samples have demonstrated the influence of motion artifact on resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rsfc-MRI). Standard rsfc-MRI preprocessing typically includes regression of confounding signals and band-pass filtering. However, substantial heterogeneity exists in how these techniques are implemented across studies, and no prior study has examined the effect of differing approaches for the control of motion-induced artifacts. To better understand how in-scanner head motion affects rsfc-MRI data, we describe the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics of motion artifacts in a sample of 348 adolescents.

The insula has hence been ascribed an integrative role, linking information from diverse functional systems. Nevertheless, various anatomical and functional studies in humans and non-human primates also indicate a functional differentiation of this region. In order to investigate this functional differentiation as well as the mechanisms of the functional integration in the insula, we performed activation-likelihood-estimation (ALE) meta-analyses of 1,768 functional neuroimaging experiments.

While these microstructurally defined maps have already been successfully used in the analysis of somatosensory, motor or language functions, several conceptual issues in the analysis of structure–function relationships still demand further clarification. In this paper, we demonstrate the principle approaches for anatomical localisation of functional activations based on probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps by exemplary analysis of an anterior parietal activation evoked by visual presentation of hand gestures.

ALE analysis involves modelling these foci as probability distributions whose width is based on empirical estimates of the spatial uncertainty due to the between-subject and between-template variability of neuroimaging data. ALE results are assessed against a null-distribution of random spatial association between experiments, resulting in random-effects inference. In the present revision of this algorithm, we address two remaining drawbacks of the previous algorithm.

To extend those findings we developed three paradigms to assess all three core components of empathy (emotion recognition, perspective taking and affective responsiveness) and clarify to which extent gender affects the neural correlates of empathic abilities. A functional MRI study was performed with 12 females (6 during their follicular phase, 6 during their luteal phase) and 12 males, measuring these tasks as well as self-report empathy …",Birgit Derntl and Andreas Finkelmeyer and Simon Eickhoff and Thilo Kellermann and Dania I Falkenberg and Frank Schneider and Ute Habel,419,10551170658721412986,Psychoneuroendocrinology,1,67-82,Pergamon,Multidimensional assessment of empathic abilities: neural correlates and gender differences,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453009003151,35,2010,/scholar?cites=10551170658721412986,wjpISMAAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC

These differing task demands are likely to elicit quantifiably different patterns of neural activity on top of a potentially consistent core network. The current study identified consistent activations across 70 motor learning experiments using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis.

The right hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus were the only regions noted to have increased GMV in patients.

Our neuroinformatic analysis was based on a neuroimaging meta-analysis of perspective-taking that yielded two separate clusters in the ventral and dorsal mPFC, respectively.

The right parahippocampal gyrus showed increased connectivity with the rIFG in patients as compared to controls. Reduced connectivity with the rIFG in patients was found for the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

The representation of discrepancies between expected and actual rewards/punishments—prediction error—is thought to update the expected value of actions and predictive stimuli. Electrophysiological and lesion studies have suggested that mesostriatal prediction error signals control behavior through synaptic modification of cortico-striato-thalamic networks. Signals in the ventromedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex are implicated in representing expected value. To obtain unbiased maps of these representations in the human brain, we performed a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that had employed algorithmic reinforcement learning models across a variety of experimental paradigms.

Network-level functional characterization further revealed that on the one hand, all interconnected regions are part of a network involved in memory processes. On the other hand, sub-networks are formed when emotion, language, social cognition and reasoning processes are required. Thus, the IPC-region that is dysregulated in both depression and schizophrenia is functionally connected to a network of regions which, depending on task demands may form sub-networks. These results therefore indicate that dysregulation of left IPC in depression and schizophrenia might not only be connected to deficits in audiovisual integration, but is possibly also associated to impaired memory and deficits in emotion processing in these patient groups.",Veronika I Müller and Edna C Cieslik and Angela R Laird and Peter T Fox and Simon B Eickhoff,49,3392503238696223034,Frontiers in human neuroscience,,268,Frontiers,Dysregulated left inferior parietal activity in schizophrenia and depression: functional connectivity and characterization,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00268/full,7,2013,/scholar?cites=3392503238696223034,wjpISMAAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C

Little is known, however, about changes in interregional integration underlying a dedifferentiation across different functional systems. In a large sample (n = 399) of healthy adults aged from 18 to 85 years, we analyzed age-dependent differences in resting-state (task-independent) functional connectivity (FC) of a set of brain regions derived from a previous fMRI study. In that study, these regions had shown an age-related loss of activation specificity in visual-attention (superior parietal area 7A and dorsal premotor cortex) or sensorimotor (area OP4 of the parietal operculum) tasks. In addition to these dedifferentiated regions, the FC analysis of the present study included “task-general” regions associated with both attention and sensorimotor systems (rostral supplementary motor area and bilateral anterior insula) as defined via meta-analytical co-activation mapping. Within this network, we observed both selective increases and decreases in resting-state FC with age. In line with regional activation changes reported previously, we found diminished anti-correlated FC for inter-system connections (i.e., between sensorimotor-related and visual attention-related regions). Our analysis also revealed reduced FC between system-specific and task-general regions, which might reflect age-related deficits in top-down control possibly leading to dedifferentiation of task-specific brain activity.

1011239,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by typical extrapyramidal motor features and increasingly recognized non-motor symptoms such as working memory (WM) deficits. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated differences in neuronal activation during a motor WM task in 23 non-demented PD patients and 23 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Participants had to memorize and retype variably long visuo-spatial stimulus sequences after short or long delays (immediate or delayed serial recall). PD patients showed deficient WM performance compared to controls, which was accompanied by reduced encoding-related activation in WM-related regions. Mirroring slower motor initiation and execution, reduced activation in motor structures such as the basal ganglia and superior parietal cortex was detected for both immediate and delayed recall. Increased activation in limbic, parietal and cerebellar regions was found during delayed recall only. Increased load-related activation for delayed recall was found in the posterior midline and the cerebellum. Overall, our results demonstrate that impairment of WM in PD is primarily associated with a widespread reduction of task-relevant activation, whereas additional parietal, limbic and cerebellar regions become more activated relative to matched controls. While the reduced WM-related activity mirrors the deficient WM performance, the additional recruitment may point to either dysfunctional compensatory strategies or detrimental crosstalk from “default-mode” regions, contributing to the observed impairment.",Claudia Rottschy and Alexandra Kleiman and Imis Dogan and Robert Langner and Shahram Mirzazade and Martin Kronenbuerger and Cornelius Werner and N Jon Shah and Jörg B Schulz and Simon B Eickhoff and Kathrin Reetz,35,1995050284977510835,PLoS One,4,e61786,Public Library of Science,Diminished activation of motor working-memory networks in Parkinson's disease,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061786,8,2013,/scholar?cites=1995050284977510835,wjpISMAAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC

1011280,"The field of social neuroscience has made considerable progress in unraveling the neural correlates of human cooperation by making use of brain imaging methods. Within this field, neuroeconomic research has drawn on paradigms from experimental economics, such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Trust Game.

Cooperation, however, does not equate with that perspective, but relies on additional psychological processes and events, including shared intentions and mutually coordinated joint action. These additional facets of cooperation have been successfully addressed by research in developmental psychology, cognitive science, and social philosophy. Corresponding neuroimaging data, however, is still sparse. Therefore, in this paper, we present a juxtaposition of these mutually related but mostly independent trends in cooperation research. We propose that the neuroscientific study of cooperation could benefit from paradigms and concepts employed in developmental psychology and social philosophy. Bringing both to a neuroimaging environment might allow studying the neural correlates of cooperation by using formal models of decision-making as well as capturing the neural responses that underlie joint action scenarios, thus, promising to advance our understanding of the nature of human cooperation.",Denis Alexander Engemann and Danilo Bzdok and Simon B Eickhoff and Kai Vogeley and Leonhard Schilbach,26,17191955623455271288,Frontiers in human neuroscience,,148,Frontiers,Games people play—toward an enactive view of cooperation in social neuroscience,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00148/full,6,2012,/scholar?cites=17191955623455271288,wjpISMAAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC
1011281,"When stimulus intensity in simple reaction-time tasks randomly varies across trials, detection speed usually improves after a low-intensity trial. With auditory stimuli, this improvement was often found to be asymmetric, being greater on current low-intensity trials. Our study investigated (1) whether asymmetric sequential intensity adaptation also occurs with visual stimuli; (2) whether these adjustments reflect decision-criterion shifts or, rather, a modulation of perceptual sensitivity; and (3) how sequential intensity adaptation and its underlying mechanisms are affected by mental fatigue induced through prolonged performance. In a continuous speeded detection task with randomly alternating high- and low-intensity visual stimuli, the reaction-time benefit after low-intensity trials was greater on subsequent low- than high-intensity trials. This asymmetry, however, only developed with time on task (TOT). Signal-detection analyses showed that the decision criterion transiently became more liberal after a low-intensity trial, whereas observer sensitivity increased when the preceding and current stimulus were of equal intensity. TOT-induced mental fatigue only affected sensitivity, which dropped more on low- than on high-intensity trials. This differential fatigue-related sensitivity decrease selectively enhanced the impact of criterion down-shifts on low-intensity trials, revealing how the interplay of two perceptual mechanisms and their modulation by fatigue combine to produce the observed overall pattern of asymmetric performance adjustments to varying visual intensity in continuous speeded detection.

1011284,"The importance of integrating research findings is incontrovertible and procedures for coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) such as Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) have become a popular approach to combine results of fMRI studies when only peaks of activation are reported.

Like classical meta-analyses, coordinate-based meta-analyses can be subject to different forms of publication bias which may impact results and invalidate findings. The file drawer problem refers to the problem where studies fail to get published because they do not obtain anticipated results (e.g. due to lack of statistical significance).

Such impairments may result from the likewise prevalent executive deficits in these patients. However, studies investigating this relationship are rare. Moreover, most studies to date have only assessed impairments in unimodal emotional processing, whereas in real life, emotions are primarily conveyed through more than just one sensory channel. The current study therefore aimed at investigating multi-modal emotional processing in patients with depression and to assess the relationship between emotional and neurocognitive impairments. 41 patients suffering from major depression and 41 never-depressed healthy controls participated in an audiovisual (faces-sounds) emotional integration paradigm as well as a neurocognitive test battery. Our results showed that depressed patients were specifically impaired in the processing of positive auditory stimuli as they rated faces significantly more fearful when presented with happy than with neutral sounds. Such an effect was absent in controls. Findings in emotional processing in patients did not correlate with BDI-scores. Furthermore, neurocognitive findings revealed significant group differences for two of the tests. The effects found in audiovisual emotional processing, however, did not correlate with performance in the neurocognitive tests. In summary, our results underline the diversity of impairments going along with depression and indicate that deficits found for unimodal emotional processing cannot trivially be generalized to deficits in a multi …",Sophie Doose-Grünefeld and Simon B Eickhoff and Veronika I Müller,13,11766517428895534796,Frontiers in integrative neuroscience,,3,Frontiers,Audiovisual emotional processing and neurocognitive functioning in patients with depression,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2015.00003/full,9,2015,/scholar?cites=11766517428895534796,wjpISMAAAAAJ:OBSaB-F7qqsC

Using this finding as a seed region, we further examined and compared networks as reflected by resting state connectivity, meta-analytic-connectivity modeling, structural covariance and probabilistic tractography.

A growing literature suggests that DNNs outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of neuroimaging applications, yet there are few direct comparisons of relative utility. Here, we compared the performance of three DNN architectures and a classical machine learning algorithm (kernel regression) in predicting individual phenotypes from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns. One of the DNNs was a generic fully-connected feedforward neural network, while the other two DNNs were recently published approaches specifically designed to exploit the structure of connectome data. By using a combined sample of almost 10,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and UK Biobank, we showed that the three DNNs do not outperform kernel regression across a wide range of behavioral and demographic measures. Furthermore, the generic feedforward neural network exhibited similar performance to the two state-of-the-art connectome-specific DNNs. We conclude with suggestions on future neuroimaging DNN research, including comparisons with stronger baseline algorithms, minimum sample sizes, transparency of hyperparameter tuning and code availability.

Many associations between psychometric data, particularly intelligence and personality measures and local variations of brain cortical thickness (CT) have been reported.

Here, we empirically investigated the replicability of associations of an extended range of psychometric variables and CT in a large cohort of healthy adults. Our analyses revealed low likelihood of significant associations. Furthermore, significant associations from exploratory analyses showed overestimated effect sizes and were rarely replicable in an independent sample.

However, most prediction studies are underpowered, relying on less than a few hundred participants, leading to low reliability and inflated prediction performance.

The key observation is that many large-scale datasets collect a wide range inter-correlated phenotypic measures. Therefore, a unique phenotype from a boutique study likely correlates with (but is not the same as) some phenotypes in some large-scale datasets. Meta-matching exploits these correlations to boost prediction in the boutique study. We applied meta-matching to the problem of predicting non-brain-imaging phenotypes using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Using the UK Biobank (N = 36,848), we demonstrated that meta-matching can boost the prediction of new phenotypes in small independent datasets by 100% to 400% in many scenarios.

1011436,"Current approaches to cerebral cortex parcellation with resting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) can be divided into local (eg, fcMRI gradients) and global (eg, clustering) approaches. Previous work suggests that local and global approaches capture complementary aspects of brain organization. Here we propose a novel hidden Markov Random Field model that fuses local connectivity gradients with global functional connectivity similarities. The resulting parcellation compares favorably with a state-of-the-art parcellation in terms of (1) parcel homogeneity in two different datasets and (2) agreement with cytoarchitectonic and visuotopic boundaries.PurposeCerebral cortical areas are fundamental units of brain function and historically defined by local transitions in microarchitecture 1, 2. The idea of local transitions was adopted by resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) parcellations using functional connectivity gradients 3. Consequently, local approaches appeared to capture cytoarchitectonic boundaries 4. These local approaches contrasted with global approaches 5-8 that directly or indirectly maximized the functional homogeneity within parcels. Here we combined both local and global approaches in a single fusion model yielding a cortical parcellation with excellent parcel homogeneity and alignment with cytoarchitectonic and visuotopic areal boundaries.MethodsWe utilized rs-fMRI data from the Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP 9).

Functional neuroimaging provides a powerful tool for the localization of function, which allows testing hypotheses about structure-function relationships.

Such understanding would provide insights into their role in functional networks, and form the anatomical basis of the functional segregation of this region as shown in recent in-vivo imaging studies. Here, we investigated the cytoarchitecture of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lateral OFC) in serial histological sections of ten human postmortem brains by image analysis and a statistically reproducible approach to detect borders between cortical areas. Profiles of the volume fraction of cell bodies were therefore extracted from digitized histological images, describing laminar changes from the layer I/layer II boundary to the white matter. As a result, four new areas, Fo4-7, were identified. Area Fo4 was mainly found in the anterior orbital gyrus, Fo5 anteriorly in the inferior frontal gyrus, Fo6 in the lateral orbital gyrus, and Fo7 in the lateral orbital sulcus. Areas differed in cortical thickness, abundance and size of pyramidal cells in layer III and degree of granularity in layer IV.

Recent work suggests that resting-state and task-state functional connectivity can predict specific traits at the individual level. However, the focus of most studies on single behavioral traits has come at the expense of capturing broader relationships across behaviors. Here, we utilized a large-scale dataset of 1858 typically developing children to estimate whole-brain functional network organization that is predictive of individual differences in cognition, impulsivity-related personality, and mental health during rest and task states. Predictive network features were distinct across the broad behavioral domains: cognition, personality and mental health. On the other hand, traits within each behavioral domain were predicted by highly similar network features. This is surprising given decades of research emphasizing that distinct brain networks support different mental processes. Although tasks are known to modulate the functional connectome, we found that predictive network features were similar between resting and task states.

Based on analyses in two independent large-scale cohorts, we report high levels of within-pipeline reliability of the absolute cortical thickness-estimates and comparable spatial patterns of cortical thickness-estimates across all pipelines. Within each individual, absolute regional thickness differed between pipelines, indicating that in-vivo thickness measurements are only a proxy of actual thickness of the cortex, which shall only be compared within the same software package and thickness estimation technique.

A major challenge toward this aim, however, is the presence of multiple organizational principles in the brain, most fundamentally, the coexistence of regional specialization in structure as well as function and functional integration, that is, connectivity. This chapter first outlines these fundamental principles before summarizing current approaches for assessing and modeling connectivity in the human brain: (i) Structural (or anatomical) connectivity analysis delineates and characterizes fiber tracts connecting distant brain regions; (ii) functional connectivity assesses the presence of coherent or correlated activity across the brain in either a task-free or task-driven state; and (iii) effective connectivity provides models of context …",Simon B Eickhoff and Christian Grefkes,2,14193887928911814926,,,213-226,"Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg",Modeling connectivity in health and disease: examples from the motor system,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-34342-1_17,,2013,/scholar?cites=14193887928911814926,wjpISMAAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC

1011480,"For decades, schizophrenia has been primarily conceptualized as a disorder of high-order cognitive functions with deficits in executive brain regions. Yet due to the increasing reports of early sensory processing deficit, recent models focus more on the developmental effects of impaired sensory process on high-order functions. The present study examined whether this pathological interaction relates to an overarching system-level imbalance, specifically a disruption in macroscale hierarchy affecting integration and segregation of unimodal and transmodal networks. We applied a novel combination of connectome gradient and stepwise connectivity analysis to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to characterize the sensorimotor-to-transmodal cortical hierarchy organization (96 patients vs. 122 controls). Using these techniques, we demonstrated compression of the cortical hierarchy organization in schizophrenia, with a prominent compression from the sensorimotor region and a less prominent compression from the frontal-parietal region, resulting in a diminished separation between sensory and fronto-parietal cognitive systems. Further analyses suggested reduced differentiation related to atypical functional connectome transition from unimodal to transmodal brain areas.

1011481,"Personality traits are key indices of inter-individual variation. Personality is heritable and has been associated with brain structure and function. To date, it is unknown whether the relationship between personality and brain macrostructure can be explained by genetic factors. In a large-scale twin sample (Human Connectome Project, n=1106), we performed genetic correlation analyses to evaluate whether personality traits (NEO-FFI) and local brain structure have a shared genetic basis. We found a genetic overlap between personality traits and local cortical thickness in 11 of 22 observed phenotypic associations in predominantly frontal cortices. In these regions the proportion of phenotypic covariance accounted for by shared genetic effects was between 82% and 100%. Second, in the case of Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness, the phenotypic correlation between personality and local cortical thickness was observed to reflect genetic, more than environmental, factors. Our observations indicate that genetic factors influence the relationship between personality traits and local brain structure. Importantly, associations between personality traits and local brain structure observed in the HCP sample only partly replicate in two independent large-scale samples of unrelated individuals (GSP: n=926, eNKI: n=792). Taken together, our findings suggest that shared genetic mechanisms impact the relationship between personality and local brain structure, but that phenotypic associations are, to a large extent, weak and non-generalizable.

We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the CCS in four cohorts (discovery, n=2,271), followed by meta-analysis, and replication in a fifth cohort (n=865). Secondary genetic and clinical imaging analyses were performed in two major depressive disorder case/control cohorts (n=967 cases and n=508 controls). Results: The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17076061 on chromosome 5q35.2 was associated with the CCS at genome-wide significance and replicated. Psychiatric cross-disorder polygenic risk scores were associated with the CCS at nominal significance. However, no significant genome-wide overlap between genetic variants influencing the CCS and genetic risk for different disorders was found after correction for multiple testing. Further secondary analyses revealed a dependence of the association of the identified variant on interactions with age. Conclusions: We identified a significant association between a genetic variant and a transdiagnostic psychiatric marker.

Combining neuroimaging and behavioral genetic approaches in two independent large-scale datasets (n=1887) we demonstrate phenotypic and genetic correspondence between sleep, intelligence, and BMI. Sleep was associated with local thickness variation in frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices. Using a comprehensive multivariate approach, we identified two robust latent components highlighting the interdigitation of sleep, intelligence, BMI, and depression and their shared relation to regions in unimodal and heteromodal association cortices.

In this study, we thus address how the parameters of diffusion-weighted data processing for structural connectivity (SC) can influence the validation results of the whole-brain mathematical models and search for the optimal parameter settings. On this way, we simulate the functional connectivity by systems of coupled oscillators, where the underlying network is constructed from the empirical SC and evaluate the performance of the models for varying parameters of data processing. For this, we introduce a set of simulation conditions including the varying number of total streamlines of the whole-brain tractography (WBT) used for extraction of SC, cortical parcellations based on functional and anatomical brain properties and distinct model fitting modalities. We observed that the graph-theoretical network properties of structural connectome can be affected by varying tractography density and strongly relate to the model performance. We explored free parameters of the considered models and found the optimal parameter configurations, where the model dynamics closely replicates the empirical data.

In addition, we examined the activation profiles of each convergent brain region linked to cue-reactivity as seeds in task-dependent and task-independent functional connectivity analyses.

However, imaging neuroscience faces two problems:(1) the rapid growth of the fMRI literature and (2) the lack of a interdisciplinary unified up-to-date coding system, which leads to semantic confusion. The fully-automated fMRI database Neurosynth best addresses the first problem, while its older manually-curated counterpart, BrainMap, best tackles the second issue. This study investigates if the two databases reach similar conclusions despite their different approaches when decoding brain areas. Methods: We developed a correspondence scheme assigning appropriate Neurosynth terms to terms in the BrainMap taxonomy. This correspondence scheme enabled the comparison of decoding results across databases. The database output were behavioural functional profiles of brain areas showing consistent and selective associations derived by the Forward and Reverse Inference analyses. Eventually, we compared the functional profiles derived by fMRI databases with results from literature search in invasive, animal-based studies.

1011565,"Background: Organizational principles of brain structure and function are important for mediation of complex adaptive behavioral traits. When aspects of these hierarchical brain organizations go awry, maladaptive disease phenotypes with varying behavioral implications emerge. The hierarchical organizations of the neurobiological blueprints for adaptive behavior are governed by the role of genes, especially their expressive codes, in mediating molecular processes critical for the cellular and systems-level development and functions of the brain, which, in turn bridges the genetic effects on complex behavioral phenotypes. Although over ~10% of the United States adult population suffers from mood-related symptoms and disability, hierarchical gene expression modules underlying pathological brain phenotypes associated with diagnostic mood symptoms remains poorly undefined.  Methods: Here, we dissected anterior insula tissue identified to be reduced in volume in mood disorders and extracted RNA-samples from the dissected tissue in an independent postmortem mood disorder and unaffected control samples. We then performed RNA-sequencing with the RNA-samples to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lifetime diagnoses of a) bipolar disorder (BD; n=37), b) major depressive disorder (MDD; n=30) vs and c) non-psychiatric controls (n=33).

Further, using an age-prediction model fitted on gray-matter data of external datasets, we predicted study participants age from their structural scans.

1011571,"Personality traits are key indices of inter-individual variation. Personality is heritable and associated with brain structure and function. To date, it is unknown whether the relation between personality and brain macrostructure can be explained by shared genetic factors. In a large-scale twin sample, we show that key personality traits, e.g. agreeableness and extraversion, were genetically associated with thickness of specific brain regions. Second, we observed that spatial patterns of phenotypic and genetic correlations between personality and cortical thickness were significantly positive, suggesting a genetic basis for phenotypic associations. However, these findings did not replicate in two large-scale datasets of unrelated individuals. We were able to reconcile this discrepancy by probing the latent relation between personality and cortical thickness using a multivariate approach. Here we could uncover a latent association between personality traits and cortical thickness. This component accounted for 30% of the variance shared between personality traits and cortical thickness. The results of our multivariate analysis indicate that personality is associated with regions supporting lower-order sensory as well as integrative cognitive processes.

Illustrating this issue, the pluripotency across behavioral functions of the hippocampus still remains poorly explained from a functional neurobiological view. Recent endeavors in activation data aggregation could contribute to our understanding by revealing functional patterns and properties that can only be observed when pooling observations of brain functional signal across an extended range of behavioral conditions1. Here, we examined a well-acknowledged functional subdivision of the hippocampus in the light of activations databases. We first applied a behavioral profiling approach to each subregion based on two different databases of activation studies, we then searched for the number of functional dimensions processed by each subregion (ie functional dimensionality) at the subject level within a dataset of subjects scanned across a wide range of behavioral paradigms.We focused on a well-acknowledged tripartite (head, body and tail) model of the right hippocampus.

Our analysis capitalized on a novel unsupervised learning approach combined with extensive stability evaluation, as well as traditional factorization approaches, all applied to the same big dataset.Orthonormal projective non-negative matrix factorization (OPNMF), was used to derive a lowrank representation of the primary measures of the D-KEFS using age-corrected standardised scores from 334 healthy adults from the Enhanced Nathan Kline Institute–Rockland Sample [4]. Cross-validation was performed through repeated split-half assessment and the most stable and optimal factor solution was selected by measuring adjusted rand index, concordance index and variation of information.

To test whether analyses based on biological information would improve the convergence of results, gene ontology (GO) terms were used to group the findings from the published studies.

1011579,"DiscussionThe differences in clusterings highlight the influence of outliers. A negative correlation between PC n and distance dz implies low intrinsic dimensionality comes paired with connectivity that is more distant from the sample (Fig. 5). While assessment of group-level parcellations reveals that clustering results were only relatively stable across thresholds for k= 2 (Fig. 6), ample evidence suggests more than 2 clusters in the R-insula [5, 6, 7]. Thus, differences due to outliers in k> 2 clusterings are problematic. As linkage algorithms in hierarchical clustering as well as k-means clustering are sensitive to outliers [8], it is important to remove them by using a proper identification threshold. In the future we will focus on automatic identification of parameters that lead to biologically meaningful parcellations.Acknowledgments: This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, EI 816/11-1), the National Institute of Mental Health (R01-MH074457), the Helmholtz Portfolio Theme"" Supercomputing and Modeling for the Human Brain"" and and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement 785907 (HBP SGA2)",Niels Reuter and Sarah Genon and Shahrzad Kharabian and Tobias Kalenscher and Felix Hoffstaedter and Rainer Goebel and Simon Eickhoff and Kaustubh Patil,0,,,,,,The effect of outliers and their exclusion on resting-state connectivity-based parcellation,https://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/850083/files/nreuter_ohbm_2018_v4.pdf,,2018,,wjpISMAAAAAJ:nWoA1JPTheMC

1011581,"In schizophrenia (SCZ), dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been linked to the deficits in executive functions and attention. It has been suggested that, instead of considering the right DLPFC as a cohesive functional entity, it can be divided into two parts (anterior and posterior) based on its whole-brain connectivity patterns. Given these two subregions' differential association with cognitive processes, we investigated the functional connectivity (FC) profile of both subregions through resting-state data to determine whether they are differentially affected in SCZ. Resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained from 120 patients and 172 healthy controls (HC) at 6 different MRI sites. The results showed differential FC patterns for the anterior and posterior parts of the right executive control- related DLPFC in SCZ with the parietal, the temporal and the cerebellar regions, along with a convergent reduction of connectivity with the striatum and the occipital cortex. An increased psychopathology level was linked to a higher difference in posterior versus anterior FC for the left IFG/anterior insula, regions involved in higher-order cognitive processes. In sum, the current analysis demonstrated that even between two neighbouring clusters connectivity could be differentially disrupted in SCZ. Lacking the necessary anatomical specificity, such notions may in fact be detrimental to a proper understanding of SCZ pathophysiology.",Natalia Chechko and Edna C Cieslik and Veronika I Müller and Thomas Nickl-Jockschat and Birgit Derntl and Lydia Kogler and André Aleman and Renaud Jardri and Iris E Sommer and Oliver Gruber and Simon B Eickhoff,0,,Frontiers in psychiatry,,211,Frontiers,Differential resting-state connectivity patterns of the right anterior and posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) in Schizophrenia,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00211/full,9,2018,,wjpISMAAAAAJ:rqnDXT1GswoC

1011587,"In Germany, a public discussion has recently been initiated on age determination of young migrants without valid identity documents. With reference to the so-called Horvath clock it has been frequently asked whether methods for age estimation based on DNA methylation analysis can already be used in forensic practice. Against this background it was examined whether the epigenetic methods proposed so far for age estimation already meet the requirements that have to be met in the German legal system before being used in forensic practice. The epigenetic approach for age estimation is undoubtedly promising; however, it has to be concluded that this approach is not yet sufficiently mature for use in forensic practice, because essential research questions still remain unclear and the error ranges that can be anticipated from the published data still appear to be too high for an application in cases of young migrants with unknown age. After clarification of all relevant research questions and adequate optimization of appropriate methods with respect to their accuracy, it would be necessary to formulate scientific standards (from sampling to the details of expert opinions) and to establish further quality assurance strategies (e.aEurog. interlaboratory proficiency testing). Only in this way will it be possible to ensure a level of expertise that is indispensable in the forensic context in Germany.

1011588,"Abstract: Verbal fluency (VF) tasks are well-established parts of executive function (EF) batteries 
commonly used in neuropsychological assessment. In particular, it is thought that this task can 
provide a general idea about individual EF capacities while using a simple and ecologically 
valid paradigm. Nevertheless, it is still an open question which EF ability is really being measured 
or proxied by a VF task. Additionally, the switching component of this test is less regularly applied 
than the simple semantic component, even though it has been argued that the former is better 
at tapping into EF [1]. The present study aims to examine which EF is mostly involved in each 
of the different VF tasks.We tested 108 monolingual German speaking healthy subjects (mean

1011591,"Connectivity-Based Parcellation (CBP) identifies distinct subregions by clustering voxels based on their connectivity fingerprint [1]. In that context, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), and structural covariance (SC) provide complementary windows into regional differentiation. Due to its relatively high accessibility, RSFC-CBP has been most widely used to examine brain organization. While several denoising strategies can be used in that purpose, their effects on CBP has not yet been investigated. Here, we examined the reliability and reproducibility of RSFC-CBP as a function of different denoising approaches in one of the most studied brain regions, the hippocampus.Our VOI was defined based on micro-and macro-structure [2, 3, 4].

For cross-modal comparison SC-CBP was applied on grey matter probabilities modulated for non-linear transformations. MACM-CBP was performed based on coactivation profiles calculated across BrainMap studies [7]. In all cases, parcellation was performed by k-means for k= 2-7.

A frequently reported finding is that the effects of various common genetic variations are associated with structural changes in brain regions that are known to be affected in schizophrenia. Moreover, given that the diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on a constellation of clinical symptoms, rather than a common pathomechanism, a structural endophenotype might be easier to delineate, when recurring to biological criteria rather than diagnosis. Coordinate-based meta-analyses are powerful tools to potentially objectify these hypotheses, capitalizing on the wealth of the published literature in this field.MethodsWe then used the anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm on a total of 30 imaging genetics studies on schizophrenia variants.

In the right PMd inferior portion, one main region showing eye-field functions was highlighted, whereas the inferior portion of the left PMd was robustly subdivided into a rostral (left rostro-inferior PMd) and a caudal (left iPMd) subregions. While the left rostro-inferior PMd showed clear associations with abstract cognitive functions, the left iPMd showed associations with both visuo-motor and language functions. Recently, Glasser et al.[4] proposed a new bilateral area at the location of right and left iPMd that was activated for language processing, and thus labeled"" language Area 55b"". However, in our prior work we did not find significant associations with language functions in the right iPMd using our quantitative approach [1].

1011607,"A typical neuroimaging study will produce a 3D brain statistic image that summarises the evidence for activation during the experiment. However, for practical reasons those images are rarely published; instead, authors only report the (x, y, z) locations of local maxima in the statistic image. Neuroimaging meta-analyses use these foci from multiple studies to find areas of consistent activation across the human brain. However, current methods in the field do not account for study-specific characteristics. Therefore, we propose a fully Bayesian model based on log-Gaussian Cox processes that allows for the inclusion of study-specific variables. We present an efficient MCMC scheme based on the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate draws from the posterior.

1011630,"Background: Task-based fMRI studies of adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have revealed various ADHD-related dysfunctional brain regions, with heterogeneous findings across studies. Here, we used novel meta-analytic data-driven approaches to characterize the function and connectivity profile of ADHD-related dysfunctional regions consistently detected across studies. Methods: We first conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 24 task-based fMRI studies in adults with ADHD. Each ADHD-related dysfunctional region resulting from the ALE meta-analysis was then analyzed using functional decoding based on~ 7,500 fMRI experiments in the BrainMap database. This approach allows mapping brain regions to functions not necessarily tested in individual studies, thus suggesting possible novel functions for those regions. Additionally, ADHD-related dysfunctional regions were clustered based on their functional co-activation profiles across all the experiments stored in BrainMap (meta-analytic connectivity modeling). Results: ADHD-related hypoactivation was found in left putamen, left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), left temporal pole, and right caudate. Functional decoding mapped the left putamen and the left temporal lobe to cognitive aspects of music perception/reproduction and language semantics, respectively; both these regions clustered together based on their meta-analytic functional connectivity. Left inferior gyrus mapped to executive function tasks; right caudate mapped both to executive functions tasks and music-related processes.

1011634,"MethodsA volume of interest (VOI) was defined by merging PMd activation sites from several meta-analyses serving as robust functional localizers of the PMd while excluding primary sensorimotor areas. MACM-CBP6 was performed using Brainmap database. RSFC-CBP and PDT-CBP were performed on distinct datasets to ensure independent parcellation7. RSFC-CBP was computed on RS data of 124 healthy subjects (age: 39.5±11.5 yrs., 66 males) from the 1000BRAINS project8. The voxels’ time series (TS) were first cleaned from confounding effects using PCA denoising and global signal regression. RSFC was then computed by Pearson correlations between the TS of the VOI voxels and those of the rest of the brain. PDT-CBP9 was performed on DWI data of 20 healthy subjects (age: 18.5±. 76, 10 males) using FSL. Several cluster solutions (k solution) were examined with k-means for MACM-and RSFC-CBP and spectral clustering for PDT-CBP. The choice of the k solution was driven by task-based functional data (MACM) based on three criteria: variation of information, percentage of deviants, and silhouette value6.ResultsThe selected criteria jointly identified the 5-cluster (5k) solution as optimal across the range of functional studies from Brainmap database (Figure 1). Examination of stability across subjects following PDT-CBP further suggested that k= 5 may be considered a local optimum within 2≤ k≤ 6.

1011636,"Purpose: To investigate the distribution of co-activation patterns of the recently identified ventral visual areas FG1 and FG2 of the posterior fusiform gyrus using the novel meta-analytic approach Pa-MiNI (Pattern Mining in NeuroImaging).Materials and Methods: All neuroimaging experiments reporting activation foci within FG1 or FG2 were retrieved from the BrainMap database. The stereotaxic activation foci in standard reference space were analyzed with PaMiNI. Here, Gaussian mixture modeling was applied to the stereotaxic coordinates of all foci to identify the underlying brain regions of each dataset. Then, association analysis was performed to reveal frequent co-activations across the modeled brain regions. Results: Co-activation patterns of FG1 were mainly found within the visual system, ie in early visual areas, and were symmetrically distributed across both hemispheres. FG2 features several extra-visual co-activations, mainly to inferior frontal, premotor and parietal regions. Furthermore, the co-activations of FG2 showed clear lateralization to the left FG2.Conclusion: FG1 shows characteristics of an intermediate visual area between the early ventral visual cortex and the category-specific higher-order areas. Co-activation patterns of FG2 indicate that FG2 is a higher-order visual area that probably corresponds to the posterior fusiform face area and partly the visual word-form area.",J Caspers and SB Eickhoff and K Amunts and G Antoch and K Zilles,0,,RöFo-Fortschritte auf dem Gebiet der Röntgenstrahlen und der bildgebenden Verfahren,10,892-898,© Georg Thieme Verlag KG,PaMiNI-Derived Co-Activation Patterns Indicate Differential Hierarchical Levels for Two Ventral Visual Areas of the Fusiform Gyrus,https://d-nb.info/1169925251/34,187,2015,,wjpISMAAAAAJ:L_l9e5I586QC

1011638,"Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) effectively increases cortical excitability within the human brain (Huang et al., 2005). However, individual after-effects of iTBS vary between subjects, with a large proportion not responding at all in terms of changes in excitability (Ridding and Ziemann, 2010, Hamada et al., 2013). We here investigated whether subjects responding to iTBS show differential changes in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within the cortical motor system compared to subjects with no response and whether the application of multiple iTBS-blocks can alter responsiveness.We used a sham-stimulation controlled, single-blinded within-subject design to test for iTBS after-effects on (i) motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and (ii) resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in 16 healthy, right-handed subjects (m = 7, 27 ± 3 years). iTBS was applied over the left primary motor cortex …",C Nettekoven and LJ Volz and M Kutscha and E-M Pool and SB Eickhoff and GR Fink and C Grefkes,0,,Clinical Neurophysiology,8,e134,Elsevier,P82.

Little is known about the changes of the interplay of brain regions that enable the modulation of motor performance after stroke. In healthy subjects, an important feature of faster hand movements is mediated by a more effective coupling between distinct cortical and subcortical motor areas. But the mechanisms underlying the dynamic modulation of motor behavior in stroke patients related to motor impairment and recovery thereof are still unclear.We, therefore, investigated 10 chronic stroke patients with mild to moderate unilateral hand motor deficits and 10 healthy, age-matched controls by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Here, functional connectivity (FC) between these nodes representing both networks was studies using resting-state FC.Resting-state fMRI data of 200 healthy adults (age 44.1 ± 17.9; 79 male) were included in the cross correlation analysis of 9 bilateral nodes including frontal (FEF), supplementary (SEF), cingulate (CEF) and parietal eye fields (PEF), V5 and V6, as well as the superior colliculus (SupCol), the lateral geniculate body (CGL …",F Hoffstaedter and SB Eickhoff and P zu Eulenburg,0,,Clinical Neurophysiology,8,e70-e71,Elsevier,V11.

1011641,"Healthy elderly adults typically show greater regional activity in frontoparietal brain regions relative to young adults when performing motor control tasks (Ward and Frackowiak, 2003, Vallesi et al., 2011). However, the functional role of enhanced activity within the motor network is still a matter of debate. One hypothesis is that higher levels of neural activity reflect a compensatory mechanism to account for age-related decline in neural networks. We, therefore, used a systems-level approach to investigate networks dynamics underlying motor control in young and elderly subjects. We hypothesized that advanced aging is associated with reduced connectivity in the basic motor network, which is compensated by stronger influence of non-primary motor areas like prefrontal cortex.We scanned 12 young (age 22–33) and 12 elderly subjects (age 52–74) employing a computerized task involving both …",J Michely and LJ Volz and F Hoffstaedter and S Viswanathan and SB Eickhoff and GR Fink and C Grefkes,0,,Clinical Neurophysiology,8,e99,Elsevier,P101.

1011680,"Background: Acute peripheral facial nerve paralysis (Bell's palsy; idiopathic facial paralysis) is the most common mononeuropathy of all cranial nerves. A differential diagnosis of symptomatic causes (bacterial, viral or neoplastic) from the idiopathic aetiology can be challenging on the basis of clinical signs alone, especially when medical records lack typical symptoms such as Erythema chronicum migrans. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of cranial computed tomography (cCT) in the differential diagnostic work-up in patients with acute peripheral facial nerve paralysis. Methods: Data from 550 patients with peripheral facial nerve paralysis at the Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty of the RWTH Aachen, Germany, were analysed retrospectively. In addition to assessing the clinical results, imaging data were utilised to calculate the predictive value of neuroimaging in relation to facial nerve paralysis. Results: 80% of the patients received a cCT including imaging of the petrosal bone. Only in 3 patients (0.7%), did the imaging result in the diagnosis of facial palsy. In all 3 patients, however, a non-idiopathic facial nerve paralysis had already been diagnosed on the basis of the anamnesis and neurological/clinical examination (multiple cranial nerve involvement). Conclusion: In compliance with the guidelines of the German Association for Neurology, application of cCT is not indicated in the differential diagnosis of acute facial nerve paralysis without the existent of additional neurological deficiencies or signs of trauma or tumours.

1011684,"The organization of the cerebral cortex into distinct modules may be described along several dimensions, most importantly structure, connectivity and function. Functional neuroimaging provides a powerful tool for the localization of function, which allows testing hypotheses about structure—function relationships. This method is, however, intrinsically less well suited to delineate the organization of a particular brain region. While neuroimaging studies may thus test hypotheses about a functional differentiation between cortical modules, their potential for delineating those in a particular region of interest is limited. Identiﬁcation of cortical modules by differences in whole-brain connectivity proﬁles derived from diffusion tensor imaging or resting state correlations have therefore raised much recent interest. As these approaches, however, do not carry task-related informa-tion, the functional relevance of the obtained parcellation have so far remained largely elusive.The emergence of comprehensive databases for functional neuroimaging results provides a novel basis for delineating cortical modules by co-activation networks. Importantly, such approaches are data-driven in that they do not rely on a classiﬁcation of tasks or paradigms, but merely rely on the spatial pattern of whole brain co-activation proﬁles.

1011721,"Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder resulting in prominent impairments in social functioning. Thus, clinical research has focused on underlying deficits of emotion processing and their linkage to specific symptoms and neurobiological dysfunctions. Although there is substantial research investigating impairments in unimodal affect recognition, studies in schizophrenia exploring crossmodal emotion processing are rare. Therefore, event related potentials (ERPs) were measured in 15 patients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy controls while rating the expression of happy, fearful and neutral faces and concurrently being distracted by emotional or neutral sounds. Compared to controls patients with schizophrenia revealed significantly decreased P1 and elevated P2 amplitudes in response to all faces, independent of emotion or concurrent sound. Analysing these effects with regard to audiovisual (in) congruence revealed that, P1 amplitudes in patients were only reduced in response to emotionally incongruent stimulus pairs, whereas similar amplitudes between groups could be observed for congruent conditions. Correlation analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between general symptom severity (BPRS-V4) and P1 amplitudes in response to congruent audiovisual stimulus pairs. These results indicate that early visual processing deficits in schizophrenia are apparent during emotion processing but, depending on symptom severity, these deficits can be restored by presenting concurrent emotionally congruent sounds.",Tanja Kellermann and Sarah C Seligman and Bruce Turetsky and Simon B Eickhoff,0,,,,,,Modulation of Affective Face Processing Deficits in Schizophrenia by Congruent Emotional Sounds.,https://www.academia.edu/download/50919141/Modulation_of_Affective_Face_Processing_20161216-5575-1vakoln.pdf,,2012,,wjpISMAAAAAJ:XeErXHja3Z8C

1011724,"Background: Recovery of motor function after stroke varies considerably between patients. Techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are frequently used to identify predictors of clinical outcome. After stroke ipsilesional motor thresholds are often elevated and tend to decrease over time concurrent to recovery. Likewise, fMRI measures of effective connectivity among motor areas demonstrated pathological coupling to ipsilesional M1. In this study the relationship between the parameters of these two different brain-mapping tools was investigated in chronic stroke patients.Methods: 15 chronic stroke patients with a persistent motor deficit and 11 age-matched healthy subjects were scanned with fMRI while performing fist closure movements with the left or right hand.

1011725,"The>> Decade of the Brain<< had major influence on our understanding of the functional neuroanatomy. Based on PET, fMRI, MEG and other neuroimaging techniques, numerous papers on>> neural correlates of...<< have been published. In the wake of this explosion of papers came novel techniques to meta-analyse the wealth of data, which further improved our knowledge on structure-function relationships in the brain. We now know that very few brain areas are specialised for one particular function, but rather, like Broca's region, are organised in fashions described as>> networks<< by some authors. The notion of a network, however, implies more than coincidental activation: It implies understanding of the interplay of the network nodes. Statistical software packages for the analysis of neuroimaging data thus provide us with novel approaches to investigate the connectivity within networks functionally and causally. The present talk demonstrates the development in using connectivity analyses for better understanding the functional neuroanatomy of language processing. We demonstrate how the combination of the Jülich cytoarchitectonic probabilistic brain atlas in combination with connectivity analysis provides insights into the dynamics within the language network around Broca's region that exceeds the traditional GLM approach, since connectivity analysis may detect subtle differences which are not tapped by simple region-wise comparisons of amplitudes of the hemodynamic response function.",Stefan Heim and Simon B Eickhoff,0,,Studientexte zur Sprachkommunikation: Elektronische Sprachsignalverarbeitung 2011,,59-65,"TUDpress, Dresden",Deeper insights into the role of Broca’s region in language processing by connectivity analysis,http://www.essv.de/paper.php?id=11,,2011,,wjpISMAAAAAJ:4oJvMfeQlr8C

1011751,"Q2 INTRODUCTION It has now been approximately 50 years since the identification of the first human aneuploid conditions (1, 2). In the intervening half-century, research on the genesis of aneuploidy has addressed three basic questions: How frequent (and clinically important) is aneuploidy? What is the parental and meiotic/mitotic source of the extra or missing chromosome? What are the underlying non-disjunctional mechanisms that yield aneuploidy? The first of these questions has now been answered: aneuploidy is astonishingly common and extremely important clinically in our species. No fewer than 5% of all clinically recognized pregnancies are trisomic or monsomic. Most of these terminate in utero, making aneuploidy the leading known cause of miscarriage but some (eg trisomy 21) are compatible with livebirth, making aneuploidy the leading cause of congenital birth defects and mental retardation (3).",Terry Hassold,0,,Human Molecular Genetics,1-5,,,AUTHOR QUERIES-TO BE ANSWERED BY THE CORRESPONDING AUTHOR,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Terry_Hassold/publication/5934232_Hassold_T_Hall_H_Hunt_P_The_origin_of_human_aneuploidy_where_we_have_been_where_we_are_going_Hum_Mol_Genet_16_R203-R208/links/577d5bac08aeaee3b27e3a9c/Hassold-T-Hall-H-Hunt-P-The-origin-of-human-aneuploidy-where-we-have-been-where-we-are-going-Hum-Mol-Genet-16-R203-R208.pdf,16,2007,,wjpISMAAAAAJ:NDuN12AVoxsC

1011761,"There is significant interest in using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) to predict behavior (Finn et al., 2015). Accurate estimates of predictive validity require at least a few hundred subjects (Poldrack et al., 2019). Larger sample sizes also yield better prediction performance (He et al., 2020). The sample size requirement is easily satisfied by large-scale neuroimaging studies (eg, UK Biobank; Sudlow et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2016). However, small studies of rare diseases or phenotypes might face sample size issues. Here, we propose “meta-matching”, a simple approach that significantly improves behavior prediction of small samples by exploiting large datasets with completely different behaviors. The key insight is that most behaviors are correlated, so behavior X from a small study is probably correlated with some behavior Y in a large study. Thus, a predictive model built from behavior Y in the large study might still be useful for predicting X in the small study. Using the UK Biobank dataset (N= 37848) with 67 behaviors, our metamatching with kernel ridge regression (KRR) or fully connected neural network (FNN) approach significantly outperformed the KRR baseline by large margins. FNN meta-matching outperformed KRR meta-matching. By adding finetuning to metamatching FNN, the performance further improved.

However, the extent of potential shared neurobiological disturbances related to reappraisal impairment is incompletely understood. This study, therefore, aimed to identify neurobiological substrates of disturbed reappraisal using a transdiagnostic approach by performing a quantitative coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) on reappraisal tasks across various mental disorders. Following the best-practice guidelines for neuroimaging meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, ScienceDirect and Web of Science databases for whole-brain neuroimaging studies published through February 2020 that compared brain activation in patients with mental disorders and matched healthy controls during a reappraisal task. Out of 1608 publications, we retrieved 32 publications with 1240 unique individuals, providing sufficient power for conducting CBMA using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method. The reported peak coordinates for the patient/control difference in selected articles were extracted and several ALE analyses were performed to identify spatial convergence. Surprisingly, neither the pooled ALE analysis nor additional analyses restricting to in-/decreased contrasts and more homogeneous grouping of coordinates (ie, regulation direction, stimulus valence and disorder category) provided significant convergent findings.

In line with this perspective, humans decide in accordance with the maximum expected utility, ie, aiming to maximize their gains. Accumulative evidence of scientific research has critically challenged this view, by demonstrating that we, as humans, do not make our decisions from a pure rational perspective. In this work, we intended to consolidate the last decades of scientific research examining the neurobiological correlates associated with different value modulators of goal-directed decision-making. We aggregated the data from neuroimaging studies assessing human decision-making under risk and uncertainty, temporal discounting and social decision-making. Using an activation likelihood estimation approach, we identified patterns of consistent brain activation across studies. Consistent patterns of brain activation were observed for the right insula for risk and uncertainty, norm compliance and reciprocity. On the other hand, choosing delayed rewards was associated with consistent brain activation in frontal, parietal and cingulate regions. Together, these results provide a comprehensive summary of decision-making processing, constituting a unique combination of neuroimaging findings associated with the different value modulators of decision-making.",PS Moreira and A Coelho and JM Soares and P Morgado and G Bellucci and C Feng and PR Almeida and F Krueger and S Eickhoff and P Costa,0,,,,19,,A threat to reason?

Here, we examined whether the connectivity patterns of functional systems affected in schizophrenia (SCZ), Parkinson’s disease (PD), or normal aging equally translate into high classification accuracies for these conditions. We compared classification performance between pre-defined networks for each group and, for any given network, between groups. Separate support vector machine classifications of 86 SCZ patients, 80 PD patients, and 95 older adults relative to their matched healthy/young controls, respectively, were performed on functional connectivity in 12 task-based, meta-analytically defined networks using 25 replications of a nested 10-fold cross-validation scheme. Classification performance of the various networks clearly differed between conditions, as those networks that best classified one disease were usually non-informative for the other. For SCZ, but not PD, emotion-processing, empathy, and cognitive action control networks distinguished patients most accurately from controls. For PD, but not SCZ, networks subserving autobiographical or semantic memory, motor execution, and theoryof-mind cognition yielded the best classifications. In contrast, young–old classification was excellent based on all networks and outperformed both clinical classifications.

1011768,"[en] The hippocampus is a plastic brain structure that has been associated with a range of behavioral aspects but also shows vulnerability to the most frequent neurocognitive diseases. Different aspects of its organization have been revealed by studies probing its different neurobiological properties. In particular, histological work has shown a pattern of differentiation along the proximal-distal dimension, while studies examining functional properties and large-scale functional integration have primarily highlighted a pattern of differentiation along the anterior posterior dimension. To better understand how these organizational dimensions underlie the pattern of structural covariance (SC) in the human hippocampus, we here applied a non-linear decomposition approach, disentangling the major modes of variation, to the pattern of grey matter volume correlation of hippocampus voxels with the rest of the brain in a sample of 377 healthy young adults. We additionally investigated the consistency of the derived gradients in an independent sample of life-span adults and also examined the relationships between these major modes of variations and the patterns derived from microstructure and functional connectivity mapping. Our results showed that similar major modes of SC-variability are identified across the two independent datasets. The major dimension of variation found in SC runs along the hippocampal anterior-posterior axis and followed closely the principal dimension of functional differentiation, suggesting an influence of network level interaction in this major mode of morphological variability.

In the present study, we performed an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis, and performed follow-up analysis of functional connectivity and functional decoding of identified regions. We report several salient findings that extend prior work in this area. First, an alteration in reward-related activation was observed in the right ventral striatum, but this was not solely driven by hypoactivation in the SCZ group compared to healthy controls. Second, the region was characterized by functional connectivity primarily with the lateral prefrontal cortex and supplementary motor area (SMA), as well as subcortical regions such as the thalamus which show structural deficits in SCZ. Finally, although the meta-analysis showed no regions outside of the ventral striatum to be significantly altered, regions with higher functional connectivity showed a greater number of sub-threshold foci.

1011775,"The aim of this study was to provide a computational system model of effective connectivity in the human brain underlying overt speech production. Meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies and functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired during a verbal fluency task revealed a core network consisting of Brodmann’s area (BA) 44 in Broca’s region, anterior insula, basal ganglia, cerebellum, premotor cortex (PMC, BA 6) and primary motor cortex (M1, areas 4a/4p). Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) indicated the highest evidence for a system architecture featuring the insula in a serial position between BA 44 and two parallel nodes (cerebellum/basal ganglia), from which information converges onto the PMC and finally M1. Parameter inference revealed that effective connectivity from the insular relay into the cerebellum/basal ganglia is primarily task driven (preparation) while the output into the cortical motor system strongly depends on the actual word production rate (execution). DCM hence allowed not only a quantitative characterization of the human speech production network, but also the distinction of a preparatory and an executive subsystem within it.

Voxels within the histologically defined human amygdala were clustered into distinct groups based on their brain-wide coactivation maps. Using this approach, connectivity-based parcellation divided the amygdala into three distinct clusters that are highly consistent with earlier microstructural distinctions. Meta-analytic connectivity modelling then revealed the derived clusters’ brain-wide connectivity patterns, while meta-data profiling allowed their functional characterization. These analyses revealed that the amygdala’s laterobasal nuclei group was associated with coordinating high-level sensory input, whereas its centromedial nuclei group was linked to mediating attentional, vegetative, and motor responses. The often-neglected superficial nuclei group emerged as particularly sensitive to olfactory and probably social information processing. The results of this model-free approach support the concordance of structural, connectional, and functional organization in the human amygdala and point to the importance of acknowledging the heterogeneity of this region in neuroimaging research.

This study aims to investigate gray matter (GM) correlates of visuospatial and verbal WM, conceptualized as performance on the Block tapping task and Digit span task. Whole brain and regional voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses were used to investigate the association of GM volume (GMV) with performance on both forward and backward recall versions of both tasks. Analyses were performed on T1-weighted imaging data of 765 subjects (age: 55–80 years, 413 male) from the “1000BRAINS” study (Caspers et al., 2014). Regional analyses included regions of the extended multiple demand network (Camilleri et al., 2018) which can be seen as a substrate of executive processes, subsuming WM. Age and gender were included as covariates of no interest. None of the whole-brain analyses yielded any significant correlation between GMV and task performance.

However, a growing number of studies report that the respon-46 siveness to rTMS/TBS shows high inter-individual variability, some-47 times even resulting in no overall alteration of cortical excitability48 (Hamada et al., 2013; Hinder et al., 2014; López-Alonso et al., 2014). 49 Recent studies suggest that 50%-73% of subjects are non-responders 50 to rTMS/TBS (Hamada et al., 2013; Hinder et al., 2014). 51 To date, the reasons for this inter-individual variability remain 52 poorly understood. Hamada et al.(2013) suggested that the differential 53 recruitment of subtypes of cortical interneurons embedded in different 54 cortico-cortical circuits may account for about 50% of the inter-55 individual variability.

The rationale for using the prior standard deviation as the effect size threshold γ is that it equates to a ‘‘background noise level’’that is generic to the brain as a whole.
