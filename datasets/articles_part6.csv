6000,"A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton–proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb− 1 collected at s= 7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb− 1 at s= 8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H→ Z Z (⁎)→ 4 ℓ, H→ γ γ and H→ W W (⁎)→ e ν μ ν in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H→ Z Z (⁎), W W (⁎), b b¯ and τ+ τ− in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H→ Z Z (⁎)→ 4 ℓ and H→ γ γ channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0±0.4 (stat)±0.4 (sys) GeV is presented.

6001,"The simulation software for the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider is being used for large-scale production of events on the LHC Computing Grid. This simulation requires many components, from the generators that simulate particle collisions, through packages simulating the response of the various detectors and triggers.

6007,"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN promises a major step forward in the understanding of the fundamental nature of matter. The ATLAS experiment is a general-purpose detector for the LHC, whose design was guided by the need to accommodate the wide spectrum of possible physics signatures.

In the focus are the investigation of the electroweak symmetry breaking and linked to this the search for the Higgs boson as well as the search for Physics beyond the Standard Model. In this report a detailed examination of the expected performance of the ATLAS detector is provided, with a major aim being to investigate the experimental sensitivity to a wide range of measurements and potential observations of new physical processes. An earlier summary of the expected capabilities of ATLAS was compiled in 1999 [1]. A survey of physics capabilities of the CMS detector was published in [2].

6008,"The jet energy scale and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of  corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38 pb−1. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-k  t  algorithm with distance parameters R=0.4 or R=0.6. Jet energy and angle corrections are determined from Monte Carlo simulations to calibrate jets with transverse momenta p T≥20 GeV and pseudorapidities |η|<4.5. The jet energy systematic uncertainty is estimated using the single isolated hadron response measured in situ and in test-beams, exploiting the transverse momentum balance between central and forward jets in events with dijet topologies and studying systematic variations in Monte Carlo simulations.

The results are based on the complete pp collision data sample recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider at centre-of-mass energies of s= 7 TeV and s= 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 25 fb− 1. Evidence for Higgs boson production through vector-boson fusion is reported. Results of combined fits probing Higgs boson couplings to fermions and bosons, as well as anomalous contributions to loop-induced production and decay modes, are presented. All measurements are consistent with expectations for the Standard Model Higgs boson.",Georges Aad and Tatevik Abajyan and Brad Abbott and Jalal Abdallah and S Abdel Khalek and Rosemarie Aben and B Abi and M Abolins and OS AbouZeid and H Abramowicz and H Abreu and Y Abulaiti and BS Acharya and L Adamczyk and DL Adams and TN Addy and J Adelman and S Adomeit and T Adye and S Aefsky and T Agatonovic-Jovin and JA Aguilar-Saavedra and M Agustoni and SP Ahlen and A Ahmad and M Ahsan and G Aielli and TPA Åkesson and G Akimoto and AV Akimov and MA Alam and J Albert and S Albrand and MJ Alconada Verzini and M Aleksa and IN Aleksandrov and F Alessandria and C Alexa and G Alexander and G Alexandre and T Alexopoulos and M Alhroob and M Aliev and G Alimonti and L Alio and J Alison and BMM Allbrooke and LJ Allison and PP Allport and SE Allwood-Spiers and J Almond and A Aloisio and R Alon and A Alonso and F Alonso and A Altheimer and B Alvarez Gonzalez and MG Alviggi and K Amako and Y Amaral Coutinho and C Amelung and VV Ammosov and SP Amor Dos Santos and A Amorim and S Amoroso and N Amram and C Anastopoulos and LS Ancu and N Andari and T Andeen and CF Anders and G Anders and KJ Anderson and A Andreazza and V Andrei and XS Anduaga and S Angelidakis and P Anger and A Angerami and F Anghinolfi and AV Anisenkov and N Anjos and A Annovi and A Antonaki and M Antonelli and A Antonov and J Antos and F Anulli and M Aoki and L Aperio Bella and R Apolle and G Arabidze and I Aracena and Y Arai and ATH Arce and S Arfaoui and JF Arguin and S Argyropoulos and E Arik and M Arik and AJ Armbruster and O Arnaez and V Arnal and O Arslan and A Artamonov and G Artoni and S Asai and N Asbah and S Ask and B Åsman and L Asquith and K Assamagan and R Astalos and A Astbury and M Atkinson and NB Atlay and B Auerbach and E Auge and K Augsten and M Aurousseau and G Avolio and D Axen and G Azuelos and Y Azuma and MA Baak and C Bacci and AM Bach and H Bachacou and K Bachas and M Backes and M Backhaus and J Backus Mayes and E Badescu and P Bagiacchi and P Bagnaia and Y Bai and DC Bailey and T Bain and JT Baines and OK Baker and S Baker and P Balek and F Balli and E Banas and Sw Banerjee and D Banfi and A Bangert and V Bansal and HS Bansil and L Barak,1459,686220583956310503,Physics Letters B,1-3,88-119,North-Holland,Measurements of Higgs boson production and couplings in diboson final states with the ATLAS detector at the LHC,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269313006369,726,2013,/scholar?cites=686220583956310503,jB7gVJAAAAAJ:TEVcCiyi8yIC
