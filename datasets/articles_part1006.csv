Electron antineutrinos from the reactors were detected by a liquid scintillation calorimeter located at a distance of about 1 km. The detector was constructed in a tunnel protected from cosmic rays by a 300 MWE rock overburden.

1006014,"A generation of neutrino experiments have established that neutrinos mix and probably have mass. The mixing phenomenon points to processes beyond those of the Standard Model, possibly at the Grand Unification energy scale. A extensive sequence of of experiments will be required to measure precisely all the parameters of the neutrino mixing matrix, culminating with the discovery and study of leptonic CP violation. As a first step, extensions of conventional pion/kaon decay beams, such as off-axis beams or low-energy super-beams, have been considered. These could yield first observations of  transitions at the atmospheric frequency, which have not yet been observed, and a first measurement of . Experiments with much better flux control can be envisaged if the neutrinos are obtained from the decays of stored particles. One such possibility is the concept of beta beams provided by the decays of radioactive nuclei, that has been developed within the context of these studies.

Two effects are observed at either low or high energy. At low energy, the collected charge significantly decreases because of the limited ion range and energy straggling in the thick epitaxial layer. Because of this limited range effect, using low energy ions for SEB testing can significantly underestimate the SEB rate. At high energy, the presence of thick source bond wires, which partially cover the die area, as typically encountered in power MOSFETs, induce a large shadowing effect.

1006052,"The experience gained with the current generation of X-ray telescopes like Chandra and XMM-Newton has shown that low energy “soft” protons can pose a severe threat to the possibility to exploit scientific data, reducing the available exposure times by up to 50% and introducing a poorly reproducible background component.

Their contribution to the residual background will be even higher for ATHENA with respect to previous missions, given the much higher collecting area of the mirrors, even if the instruments will likely suffer no significant radiation damage from this particles flux.

This is an important issue for Athena, as no X-ray telescope has been deployed at L2 so far and the soft proton environment there is poorly known. We analyze data from the Artemis and Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft and find that fluxes of both solar and geomagnetospheric origin significantly contribute to the soft proton populations in earth's magnetotail. We then estimate the background from the measured fluxes in Athena's X-ray instruments and compare it with the science …",Dušan Budjáš and Petteri Nieminen and Piers Jiggens and Giovanni Santin and Eamonn Daly,4,688415990545934796,IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science,8,1965-1971,IEEE,Soft Proton Fluxes in and Around the Earth’s Magnetotail,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7883943/,45,2017,/scholar?cites=688415990545934796,h1AqFSwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC

Free charge carriers generated in areas in absence of electric field but near the depletion region may reach the latter through diffusion processes, then being collected by drift forces in the p-n junction of the semiconductor.

1006102,"The helium (4He) component of the primary particles in the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) spectrum makes significant contributions to total astronaut radiation exposure. He projectile ions are also desirable for direct applications in ion therapy. They contribute smaller projectile fragmentation compared to Carbon (12C) ions and smaller lateral beam spreading compared to protons. Space radiation protection and ion therapy applications need reliable nuclear reaction models and transport codes for energetic particles in matter. Neutrons and light ions (1H, 2H, 3H, 3He, 4He) are the most important secondary particles produced in space radiation and ion therapy nuclear reactions; these particles penetrate deeply and make large contributions to dose equivalent.

In order to correctly predict the dose received by astronauts and devices the simulation models must have good applicability and produce accurate results from 10 MeV/u up to 10 GeV/u, where the most radioactive hazardous particles are present in the spectra. Appropriate models should also provide a good description of electromagnetic interactions down to very low energies (10 eV/u-10 MeV/u) for understanding the damage mechanisms due to long-term low doses. Predictions of biological dose during long interplanetary journeys also need models for hadronic interactions of energetic heavy ions extending higher energies (10 GeV/u-100 GeV/u, but possibly up to 1 TeV/u).

1006118,"Detecting life in the Solar System is one of the great challenges of new upcoming space missions. One way to detect organic matter on extra-terrestrial objects could be the use of biochips. A biochip is composed of biological sensitive systems called ligands (like antibodies) fixed on a slide, which allow the detection of specific organic molecules, called biomarkers. In the case of measurements on site (from samples extracted from the planetary soil) the main concern is to ensure the survival of the biochip during the full mission. Space radiation seems to be a critical parameter, requiring a detailed investigation of the biochip behaviour under such conditions. In particular, the survival ability of the ligands must be studied, as well as slide's alterations. In this abstract, we present first simulation results of the radiation environment encountered during a Mars mission. For this purpose, two tools based on the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit have been used: GRAS and PLANETOCOSMICS. Simulations are divided into two distinct phases: the Earth-Mars travel and the stay on Mars. Earth-Mars travel and doses calculations in the biochip have been studied with the GRAS tool. Thanks to PLANETOCOSMICS we simulate the interaction of GCR (Galactic Cosmic Rays) and SPE (Solar Protons Events) spectra with Mars atmosphere and soil in order to better quantify the radiation environment at soil level. During these two phases, particles and energies involved are different.

1006126,"The Anaphe project is an ongoing effort to provide an Object Oriented software environment for data analysis in HENP experiments. A range of commercial and public domain libraries is used to cover basic functionalities; on top of these libraries a set of HENP-specific C++ class libraries for histogram management, fitting, plotting and ntuple-like data analysis has been developed. In order to comply with the user requirements for a command-line driven tool, we have chosen to use a scripting language (Python) as the front-end for a data analysis tool. The loose coupling provided by the consequent use of (AIDA compliant) Abstract Interfaces for each component in combination with the use of shared libraries for their implementation provides an easy integration of existing libraries into modern scripting languages thus allowing for rapid application development. This integration is simplified even further using a specialised toolkit (SWIG) to create"" shadow classes"" for the Python language, which map the definitions of the Abstract Interfaces almost at a one-to-one level.

Simulation work through the Monte Carlo technique can provide unique and valuable solutions allowing, for example the prediction of biological DNA damages, such as DNA single and double-strand breaks. The Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation tool-kit, an open source set of libraries developed for understanding the passage of particles through matter, covers a large variety of application domains, ranging from high energy physics to space and medical applications. The Geant4-DNA project, initiated by the European Space Agency and sponsored by the French Research National Agency, aims at providing Geant4 with new capabilities specific for radiobiology applications, including:-) Elementary physical interactions down to the sub-eV scale;-) Water radiolysis, diffusion and interactions between molecules and DNA;-) a detailed geometry of biological cells at the DNA scale. Applications are foreseen for long duration manned space exploration programs as well as for the use of radiation in the medical sector (eg, particle therapy and imaging) where radiation effects at the cellular level are of concern. An overview of the Geant4-DNA project, its recent developments and current status will be presented.
