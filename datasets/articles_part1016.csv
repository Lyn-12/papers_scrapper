1016000,"The continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide due to anthropogenic emissions is predicted to lead to significant changes in climate 1. About half of the current emissions are being absorbed by the ocean and by land ecosystems 2, but this absorption is sensitive to climate 3, 4 as well as to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations 5, creating a feedback loop. General circulation models have generally excluded the feedback between climate and the biosphere, using static vegetation distributions and CO 2 concentrations from simple carbon-cycle models that do not include climate change 6.

1016001,"The Earth's climate is determined by a number of complex connected physical, chemical and biological processes occurring in the atmosphere, land and ocean. The radiative properties of the atmosphere, a major controlling factor of the Earth's climate, are strongly affected by the biophysical state of the Earth's surface and by the atmospheric abundance of a variety of trace constituents. These constituents include long-lived greenhouse gases (LLGHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO {sub 2}), methane (CH {sub 4}) and nitrous oxide (N {sub 2} O), as well as other radiatively active constituents such as ozone and different types of aerosol particles. The composition of the atmosphere is determined by processes such as natural and anthropogenic emissions of gases and aerosols, transport at a variety of scales, chemical and microphysical transformations, wet scavenging and surface uptake by the land and terrestrial ecosystems, and by the ocean and its ecosystems. These processes and, more generally the rates of biogeochemical cycling, are affected by climate change, and involve interactions between and within the different components of the Earth system. These interactions are generally nonlinear and may produce negative or positive feedbacks to the climate system.

1016005,"Climate models have continued to be developed and improved since the AR4, and many models have been extended into Earth System models by including the representation of biogeochemical cycles important to climate change. These models allow for policy-relevant calculations such as the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions compatible with a specified climate stabilization target. In addition, the range of climate variables and processes that have been evaluated has greatly expanded, and differences between models and observations are increasingly quantified using ‘performance metrics’. In this chapter, model evaluation covers simulation of the mean climate, of historical climate change, of variability on multiple time scales and of regional modes of variability. This evaluation is based on recent internationally coordinated model experiments, including simulations of historic and paleo climate, specialized experiments designed to provide insight into key climate processes and feedbacks and regional climate downscaling.

Carbon dioxide concentration increases may make a further contribution to warming by inducing a physiological response of the global vegetation—a reduced stomatal conductance, which suppresses transpiration 2. Moreover, a CO 2-enriched atmosphere and the corresponding change in climate may also alter the density of vegetation cover, thus modifying the physicalcharacteristics of the land surface to provide yet another climate feedback 3, 4, 5, 6.

This paper describes the consolidation of these advances in the modelling of carbon fluxes and stores, in both the vegetation and soil, in version 2.2 of JULES. Features include a multi-layer canopy scheme for light interception, including a sunfleck penetration scheme, a coupled scheme of leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, representation of the effects of ozone on leaf physiology, and a description of methane emissions from wetlands. JULES represents the carbon allocation, growth and population dynamics of five plant functional types. The turnover of carbon from living plant tissues is fed into a 4-pool soil carbon model.

To date, these models indicate that the relevant carbon cycle uncertainties are smaller than the uncertainties in physical climate feedbacks and emissions.

The objective is to assess the robustness of the simulated climate change, and its possible sensitivity to the land surface scheme. Despite the use of identical SST anomalies, the four GCMs do not predict similar monsoon responses on the regional scale. All models produce a stronger warming over the Asian continent than over the Indian Ocean, but this warming is not a good predictor of the monsoon response to increased CO2 level. There is a significant spread in the summer precipitation anomalies despite a general weakening of the monsoon circulation, showing that the response of the monsoon rainfall is not solely related to the changes in the large-scale dynamics. In a warmer climate, the monsoon precipitation can increase despite a weakening of the monsoon flow, due to an increase in the atmospheric water content. For decades to come, the increase in the atmospheric water content could be more important than the increase in the land-sea thermal gradient for understanding the evolution of the monsoon precipitation.

1016088,"Scenarios that limit global warming to below 2 C by 2100 assume significant land-use change to support large-scale carbon dioxide (CO 2) removal from the atmosphere by afforestation/reforestation, avoided deforestation, and Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). The more ambitious mitigation scenarios require even greater land area for mitigation and/or earlier adoption of CO 2 removal strategies. Here we show that additional land-use change to meet a 1.5 C climate change target could result in net losses of carbon from the land.

However, the strength of the coupling between the land surface and precipitation is still highly uncertain, with climate‐model derived estimates differing by an order of magnitude. Here a statistical model of vegetation greenness is used to estimate the vegetation‐rainfall coupling strength in the Sahel, based on monthly satellite‐derived vegetation index and meteorological data.

OBGC models are now integral components of Earth system models (ESMs), but they compete for computing resources with higher resolution dynamical setups and with other components such as atmospheric chemistry and terrestrial vegetation schemes. As such, the choice of OBGC in ESMs needs to balance model complexity and realism alongside relative computing cost. Here we present an intercomparison of six OBGC models that were candidates for implementation within the next UK Earth system model (UKESM1). The models cover a large range of biological complexity (from 7 to 57 tracers) but all include representations of at least the nitrogen, carbon, alkalinity and oxygen cycles. Each OBGC model was coupled to the ocean general circulation model Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) and results from physically identical hindcast simulations were compared.

This carbon feedback depends on the physical state of the permafrost. We have therefore included improved physical permafrost processes in JULES (Joint UK Land Environment Simulator), which is the land-surface scheme used in the Hadley Centre climate models.    The thermal and hydraulic properties of the soil were modified to account for the presence of organic matter, and the insulating effects of a surface layer of moss were added, allowing for fractional moss cover. These processes are particularly relevant in permafrost zones. We also simulate a higher-resolution soil column and deeper soil, and include an additional thermal column at the base of the soil to represent bedrock. In addition, the snow scheme was improved to allow it to run with arbitrarily thin layers.    Point-site simulations at Samoylov Island, Siberia, show that the model is now able to simulate soil temperatures and thaw depth much closer to the observations. The root mean square error for the near-surface soil temperatures reduces by approximately 30%, and the active layer thickness is reduced from being over 1 m too deep to within 0.1 m of the observed active layer thickness.

Such climate-carbon cycle feedbacks will therefore influence the amount of carbon emissions required to stabilise atmospheric CO2 levels.

While noting that the potential for human enhancement of the land carbon sink through changes in land management practices is finite in size and duration, it recommends that methods used in the production of forest and agricultural crops should be modified to reflect their short-term role in absorbing carbon dioxide.

1016105,"© Author(s) 2015. There is a large amount of organic carbon stored in permafrost in the northern high latitudes, which may become vulnerable to microbial decomposition under future climate warming. In order to estimate this potential carbon-climate feedback it is necessary to correctly simulate the physical dynamics of permafrost within global Earth system models (ESMs) and to determine the rate at which it will thaw. Additional new processes within JULES, the land-surface scheme of the UK ESM (UKESM), include a representation of organic soils, moss and bedrock and a modification to the snow scheme; the sensitivity of permafrost to these new developments is investigated in this study. The impact of a higher vertical soil resolution and deeper soil column is also considered. Evaluation against a large group of sites shows the annual cycle of soil temperatures is approximately 25 % too large in the standard JULES version, but this error is corrected by the model improvements, in particular by deeper soil, organic soils, moss and the modified snow scheme. A comparison with active layer monitoring sites shows that the active layer is on average just over 1 m too deep in the standard model version, and this bias is reduced by 70 cm in the improved version. Increasing the soil vertical resolution allows the full range of active layer depths to be simulated; by contrast, with a poorly resolved soil at least 50 % of the permafrost area has a maximum thaw depth at the centre of the bottom soil layer.

The impact of vegetation variability on climate is analysed by using multivariate regressions of boundary layer fluxes and properties, with respect to soil moisture and vegetation fraction. Dynamic vegetation is found to significantly increase the variance in the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes. Vegetation growth always causes evapotranspiration to increase, but its impact …",Michel Crucifix and Richard A Betts and Peter M Cox,42,7468136443408271517,Climate Dynamics,5,457-467,Springer-Verlag,Vegetation and climate variability: a GCM modelling study,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00382-004-0504-z.pdf,24,2005,/scholar?cites=7468136443408271517,7S1cuNwAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC

These model results are qualitatively consistent with soil carbon projections published by Jenkinson almost two decades ago.

Models with and without the extra self‐heating from microbial respiration have been shown to yield significantly different results.

Past studies with JULES have demonstrated the important role of the land surface in the Earth System. Different versions of JULES have been 5 employed to quantify the effects on the land carbon sink of separately changing atmospheric aerosols and tropospheric ozone, and the response of methane emissions from wetlands to climate change. There was a need to consolidate these and other advances into a single model code so as to be able to study interactions in a consistent manner. This paper describes the consolidation of these advances into the modelling 10 of carbon fluxes and stores, in the vegetation and soil, in version 2.2 of JULES. Features include a multi-layer canopy scheme for light interception, including a sunfleck penetration scheme, a coupled scheme of leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, representation of the effects of ozone on leaf physiology, and a description of methane emissions from wetlands. JULES represents the carbon allocation, growth 15 and population dynamics of five plant functional types. The turnover of carbon from living plant tissues is fed into a 4-pool soil carbon model. The process-based descriptions of key ecological processes and trace gas fluxes in JULES mean that this community model is well-suited for use in carbon cycle, climate change and impacts studies, either in standalone mode or as the land component of a coupled Earth system model. 20",DB Clark and LM Mercado and S Sitch and CD Jones and N Gedney and MJ Best and M Pryor and GG Rooney and RLH Essery and E Blyth and O Boucher and RJ Harding and PM Cox,38,13993888353167605975,Geosci.

WUE is expected to increase with atmospheric CO2, but to decline with increasing atmospheric evaporative demand – which can arise from increases in near-surface temperature or decreases in relative humidity. We have used Δ13C measurements from tree-rings, along with eddy-covariance measurements from Fluxnet sites, to estimate the sensitivities of WUE to changes in CO2 and atmospheric humidity deficit. This enables us to reconstruct fractional changes in WUE, based on changes in atmospheric climate and CO2, for the entire period of the instrumental global climate record. We estimate that overall WUE increased from 1900 to 2010 by 48 ± 22 %, which is more than double that simulated by the latest Earth System Models.

In numerical weather prediction models it is especially important to reproduce the observed diurnal cycle in screen-level temperature, which requires an accurate representation of the surface temperature, and therefore an accurate and computationally efficient representation of soil heat storage and transfer. We present a technique for analysing the accuracy of numerical soil temperature schemes, and a methodology for choosing the optimal layer thicknesses for schemes with a given number of layers.

This paper describes adJULES in a data assimilation framework and demonstrates its ability to improve the model–data fit using eddy-covariance measurements of gross primary production (GPP) and latent heat (LE) fluxes. adJULES also has the ability to calibrate over multiple sites simultaneously.

1016135," Climate sensitivity to CO2 remains the key uncertainty in projections of future climate change. Transient climate response (TCR) is the metric of temperature sensitivity that is most relevant to warming in the next few decades and contributes the biggest uncertainty to estimates of the carbon budgets consistent with the Paris targets. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is vital for understanding longer-term climate change and stabilisation targets. In the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5), the stated “likely” ranges (16 %–84 % confidence) of TCR (1.0–2.5 K) and ECS (1.5–4.5 K) were broadly consistent with the ensemble of CMIP5 Earth system models (ESMs) available at the time. However, many of the latest CMIP6 ESMs have larger climate sensitivities, with 5 of 34 models having TCR values above 2.5 K and an ensemble mean TCR of 2.0±0.4 K. Even starker, 12 of 34 models have an ECS value above 4.5 K. On the face of it, these latest ESM results suggest that the IPCC likely ranges may need revising upwards, which would cast further doubt on the feasibility of the Paris targets.Here we show that rather than increasing the uncertainty in climate sensitivity, the CMIP6 models help to constrain the likely range of TCR to 1.3–2.1 K, with a central estimate of 1.68 K. We reach this conclusion through an emergent constraint approach which relates the value of TCR linearly to the global warming from 1975 onwards. This is a period when the signal-to-noise ratio of the net radiative forcing increases strongly, so that uncertainties in aerosol forcing become progressively less problematic. We find a consistent emergent constraint on TCR when …",Femke JMM Nijsse and Peter M Cox and Mark S Williamson,17,17016672536875624206,Earth System Dynamics,3,737-750,Copernicus GmbH,Emergent constraints on transient climate response (TCR) and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) from historical warming in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models,https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/11/737/2020/,11,2020,/scholar?cites=17016672536875624206,7S1cuNwAAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC

1016140,"Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are used for studying historical and future changes to vegetation and the terrestrial carbon cycle. JULES (the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) represents the land surface in the Hadley Centre climate models and in the UK Earth System Model. Recently the number of plant functional types (PFTs) in JULES was expanded from five to nine to better represent functional diversity in global ecosystems. Here we introduce a more mechanistic representation of vegetation dynamics in TRIFFID, the dynamic vegetation component of JULES, which allows for any number of PFTs to compete based solely on their height; therefore, the previous hardwired dominance hierarchy is removed. With the new set of nine PFTs, JULES is able to more accurately reproduce global vegetation distribution compared to the former five PFT version. Improvements include the coverage of trees within tropical and boreal forests and a reduction in shrubs, the latter of which dominated at high latitudes. We show that JULES is able to realistically represent several aspects of the global carbon (C) cycle. The simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) is within the range of observations, but simulated net primary productivity (NPP) is slightly too high.

1016142,"Palaeo-records from China demonstrate that the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) is dominated by abrupt and large magnitude monsoon shifts on millennial timescales, switching between periods of high and weak monsoon rains. It has been hypothesized that over these timescales, the EASM exhibits two stable states with bifurcation-Type tipping points between them. Here we test this hypothesis by looking for early warning signals of past bifurcations in speleothem δ18O records from Sanbao Cave and Hulu Cave, China, spanning the penultimate glacial cycle. We find that although there are increases in both autocorrelation and variance preceding some of the monsoon transitions during this period, it is only immediately prior to the abrupt monsoon shift at the penultimate deglaciation (Termination II) that statistically significant increases are detected. To supplement our data analysis, we produce and analyse multiple model simulations that we derive from these data. We find hysteresis behaviour in our model simulations with transitions directly forced by solar insolation. However, signals of critical slowing down, which occur on the approach to a bifurcation, are only detectable in the model simulations when the change in system stability is sufficiently slow to be detected by the sampling resolution of the data set. This raises the possibility that the early warning ""alarms"" were missed in the speleothem data over the period 224-150 kyr and it was only at the monsoon termination that the change in the system stability was sufficiently slow to detect early warning signals.",Zoe Amber Thomas and Frank Kwasniok and Christopher Andrew Boulton and Peter M Cox and RT Jones and TM Lenton and CSM Turney,13,16334428210136523425,,,,Copernicus Publications,Early warnings and missed alarms for abrupt monsoon transitions,https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/20978,,2015,/scholar?cites=16334428210136523425,7S1cuNwAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC

For example, coupled climate–carbon cycle models that represent land-use change simulate total land carbon stores at 2100 that vary by as much as 600 Pg C, given the same emissions scenario. This large uncertainty is associated with differences in how key processes are simulated in different models, and illustrates the necessity of determining which models are most realistic using rigorous methods of model evaluation.

When C4 plants are absent from simulated tropical ecosystems, the percentage of bare soil increases regionally, Amazonia becomes warmer during the dry season, South Africa becomes drier during the dry season, the African Sahara‐Sahel boundary becomes hotter during the dry season, and yet temperatures cool in …",SA Cowling and CD Jones and PM Cox,10,2944776839706716450,Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences,G1,,,Consequences of the evolution of C4 photosynthesis for surface energy and water exchange,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2005JG000095,112,2007,/scholar?cites=2944776839706716450,7S1cuNwAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC
1016151,"The current human-dominated era or ""Anthropocene"" has been a time of unprecedented rates of change within the Earth system. As such the Anthropocene poses a no-analogue situation in which evidence of past Earth system change cannot, on their own, tell us of how the system will respond in the future. Instead, we need to develop mechanistic and phenomenological models based on robust underlying principles to extrapolate our knowledge of the past Earth system into projections of the future. This requires an entire spectrum of Earth system models that can be related to each other in a more rigorous way that has been achieved to date. It also requires new integrated models of the two-way coupling between the biophysical and human aspects of the Earth system. Only then will we be able to approach all of the paleodata constraints on the Earth system dynamics (which require long simulations), while also providing regionally specific Earth system projections and spatially specific human development paths for policy makers (which requires, in both cases, high-resolution comprehensive models as well as models that can bridge spatial and temporal scales).

However, the mechanisms driving vegetation changes, before and after the shift, remain unclear. In this study, we used a biophysical dynamic vegetation model to estimate large-scale trends in terms of carbon fixation, vegetation growth, and expansion during the period 1958-2007, and to attribute these changes to environmental drivers including elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration (hereafter eCO 2 ), global warming, and climate variability (hereafter CV).

Significant spatial correlations are found (correlations 0.87), along with regionally varying temporal correlations of 0.34-0.80 for LAI and 0.45-0.83 for GPP. More than 40% of the global land area shows significant positive (increase) or negative (decrease) trends in LAI and GPP during 1958-2007.

We conducted C-only, carbon–nitrogen (C–N) and carbon–nitrogen–phosphorus (C–N–P) simulations of the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange model (CABLE) from 1901 to 2100 with fixed climate to identify the most critical model process that causes divergence in β.

Our results show that β values at biochemical and leaf photosynthesis levels vary little across the seven PFTs, but greatly diverge at canopy and ecosystem levels in all simulations. The low variation of the leaf-level β is consistent with a theoretical analysis that leaf photosynthetic sensitivity to increasing CO2 concentration is almost an invariant function. In the CABLE model, the major jump in variation of β values from leaf levels to canopy and ecosystem levels results from divergence in modeled leaf area index (LAI) within and among PFTs.

We contrasted HadCM3LC simulations of Amazonian forest at the Last Glacial Maximum (21 kya) and a Younger Dryas-like period (13-12 kya) with predicted responses of future warming to provide estimates of the climatic limits under which the Amazon forest remains relatively stable. Our simulations indicate that despite lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations and increased aridity during the LGM, Amazonia remains mostly forested, and that the cooler climate of the Younger Dryas-like period in fact causes a trend toward increased above-ground carbon balance relative today. The vegetation feedbacks responsible for maintaining forest integrity in past climates (ie decreased evapotranspiration and reduced photorespiration) cannot be maintained into the future. Although elevated atmospheric CO2 contributes to a positive enhancement of plant carbon and water balance, decreased stomatal conductance and increased plant and soil respiration cause a positive feedback that amplifies localised drying and climate warming.

1016169,"The meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in December 2015 committed parties at the convention to hold the rise in global average temperature to well below 2.0 °C above pre-industrial levels. It also committed the parties to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5 °C. This leads to two key questions. First, what extent of emissions reduction will achieve either target? Second, what is the benefit of the reduced climate impacts from keeping warming at or below 1.5 °C? To provide answers, climate model simulations need to follow trajectories consistent with these global temperature limits. It is useful to operate models in an inverse mode to make model-specific estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration pathways consistent with the prescribed temperature profiles. Further inversion derives related emissions pathways for these concentrations. For this to happen, and to enable climate research centres to compare GHG concentrations and emissions estimates, common temperature trajectory scenarios are required. Here we define algebraic curves that asymptote to a stabilised limit, while also matching the magnitude and gradient of recent warming levels. The curves are deliberately parameter-sparse, needing the prescription of just two parameters plus the final temperature.

1016172,"Human-driven changes to many features of the Earth system have become so ubiquitous and significant in magnitude that a new era for the planet-the"" Anthropocene""-has been proposed (Crutzen and Stoermer 2001; Clark et al., this volume). Many of these changes are large in magnitude at the planetary scale, sometimes even exceeding natural flows in major aspects of biogeochemical cycling. In addition, anthropogenic changes invariably occur at rates that are much larger than those ofnatural variability, often by an order of magnitude or more. The magnitudes and rates of these changes, coupled with the fact that changes to a large number of Earth system processes and compartments are occurring simultaneously, has led to the recognition that the Earth is now operating in a"" no-analogue state""(Steffen et al. 2004). The features of this no-analogue state present challenges to human responsiveness, challenges that have not been experienced in coping with any previous environmental changes, which have occurred at local and regional scales. These features include the facts that:• Large parts of the problem are global in scale, transcending any region, continent, or ocean basin on its own.• Connectivity between different biophysical processes and geographical areas of the planet is much greater than previously thought, and the connectivity of human activities is increasing at a rapid rate.• Human-driven changes to Earth system functioning operate on very long timescales, where the consequences of some human actions may be present for decades and centuries, and across very large space scales, where causes are spatially de-linked …",Will Steffen and Meinrat O Andreae and Bert Bolin and Paul J Crutzen and Peter M Cox and Ulrich Cubasch and Hermann Held and Nebojsa Nakicenovic and Liana Talaue-McManus and Billie L Turner III,4,6686672794378762746,,,,MIT Press,Earth system dynamics in the Anthropocene,https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/57542/8/01_Steffen_Group%20Report.pdf,,2004,/scholar?cites=6686672794378762746,7S1cuNwAAAAJ:anf4URPfarAC

1016174,"Predicting the response of forests to climate and land-use change depends on models that can simulate the time-varying distribution of different tree sizes within a forest – so-called forest demography models. A necessary condition for such models to be trustworthy is that they can reproduce the tree-size distributions that are observed within existing forests worldwide. In a previous study, we showed that demographic equilibrium theory (DET) is able to fit tree-diameter distributions for forests across North America, using a single site-specific fitting parameter (μ) which represents the ratio of the rate of mortality to growth for a tree of a reference size. We use a form of DET that assumes tree-size profiles are in a steady state resulting from the balance between a size-independent rate of tree mortality and tree growth rates that vary as a power law of tree size (as measured by either trunk diameter or biomass). In this study, we test DET against ForestPlots data for 124 sites across Amazonia, fitting, using maximum likelihood estimation, to both directly measured trunk diameter data and also biomass estimates derived from published allometric relationships. Again, we find that DET fits the observed tree-size distributions well, with best-fit values of the exponent relating growth rate to tree mass giving a mean of ϕ=0.71 (0.31 for trunk diameter). This finding is broadly consistent with exponents of ϕ=0.75 (ϕ=1/3 for trunk diameter) predicted by metabolic scaling theory (MST) allometry. The fitted ϕ and μ parameters also show a clear relationship that is suggestive of life-history trade-offs.

1016179,"A significant proportion of the uncertainty in climate projections arises from uncertainty in the representation of land carbon uptake. Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) vary in their representations of regrowth and competition for resources, which results in differing responses to changes in atmospheric CO2 and climate. More advanced cohort-based patch models are now becoming established in the latest DGVMs. These typically attempt to simulate the size-distribution of trees as a function of both tree-size (mass or trunk diameter) and age (time since disturbance). This approach can capture the overall 5 impact of stochastic disturbance events on the forest structure and biomass, but at the cost of needing to update a probability density function in two-dimensions. Here we present the Robust Ecosystem Demography (RED), in which the pdf is collapsed on to the single dimension of tree mass. RED is designed to retain the ability of more complex cohort DGVMs to represent forest demography, while also being parameter sparse and analytically soluble. The population of each Plant Functional Type (PFT) is partitioned into mass classes with a fixed baseline mortality along with an assumed power-law scaling of growth-rate 10 with mass. The analytical equilibrium solutions of RED allow the model to be calibrated against observed forest cover using a single parameter-the ratio of mortality to growth for a tree of a reference mass (µ0). We show that RED can thus be calibrated to the ESA LC_CCI (European Space Agency Land Cover Climate Change Initiative) coverage dataset for nine PFTs.

1016192," Understanding future changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle is important for reliable projections of climate change and impacts on ecosystems. It is known that nitrogen could limit plants' response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and is therefore important to include in Earth System Models. Here we present the implementation of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle in the JULES land surface model (JULES-CN). Two versions are discussed – the one implemented within the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1) which has a bulk soil biogeochemical model and a development version which resolves the soil biogeochemistry with depth. The nitrogen cycle is based on the existing carbon cycle in the model. It represents all the key terrestrial nitrogen processes in an efficient way. Biological fixation and nitrogen deposition are external inputs, and loss occurs via leaching and a bulk gas loss parameterisation. Nutrient limitation reduces carbon-use efficiency (CUE – ratio of net to gross primary productivity) and can slow soil decomposition. We show that ecosystem level limitation of net primary productivity by nitrogen is consistent with observational estimates and that simulated carbon and nitrogen pools and fluxes are comparable to the limited available observations. The impact of N limitation is most pronounced in northern mid-latitudes. The introduction of a nitrogen cycle improves the representation of interannual variability of global net ecosystem exchange which was much too pronounced in the carbon cycle only versions of JULES (JULES-C).

1016193," Accurately representing the response of ecosystems to environmental change in land surface models (LSMs) is crucial to making accurate predictions of future climate. Many LSMs do not correctly capture plant respiration and growth fluxes, particularly in response to extreme climatic events. This is in part due to the unrealistic assumption that total plant carbon expenditure (PCE) is always equal to gross carbon accumulation by photosynthesis. We present and evaluate a simple model of labile carbon storage and utilisation (SUGAR) designed to be integrated into an LSM, which allows simulated plant respiration and growth to vary independent of photosynthesis. SUGAR buffers simulated PCE against seasonal variation in photosynthesis, producing more constant (less variable) predictions of plant growth and respiration relative to an LSM that does not represent labile carbon storage. This allows the model to more accurately capture observed carbon fluxes at a large-scale drought experiment in a tropical moist forest in the Amazon, relative to the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator LSM (JULES). SUGAR is designed to improve the representation of carbon storage in LSMs and provides a simple framework that allows new processes to be integrated as the empirical understanding of carbon storage in plants improves.

1016200,"Despite major advances in climate science over the last 30 years, persistent uncertainties in projections of future climate change remain. Climate projections are produced with increasingly complex models which attempt to represent key processes in the Earth system, including atmospheric and oceanic circulations, convection, clouds, snow, sea-ice, vegetation and interactions with the carbon cycle. Uncertainties in the representation of these processes feed through into a range of projections from the many state-of-the-art climate models now being developed and used worldwide. For example, despite major improvements in climate models, the range of equilibrium global warming due to doubling carbon dioxide still spans a range of more than three. Here we review a promising way to make use of the ensemble of climate models to reduce the uncertainties in the sensitivities of the real climate system. The emergent constraint approach uses the model ensemble to identify a relationship between an uncertain aspect of the future climate and an observable variation or trend in the contemporary climate. This review summarises previous published work on emergent constraints, and discusses the huge promise and potential dangers of the approach. Most importantly, it argues that emergent constraints should be based on well-founded physical principles such as the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

We utilize the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) to evaluate emission-driven CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations with satellite data of column-average CO2 mole fractions (XCO2). XCO2 time series show a large spread among the model ensembles both in CMIP5 and CMIP6. Compared to the satellite observations, the models have a bias of +25 to −20 ppmv in CMIP5 and +20 to −15 ppmv in CMIP6, with the multi-model mean biases at +10 and +2 ppmv, respectively. The derived mean atmospheric XCO2 growth rate (GR) of 2.0 ppmv yr−1 is overestimated by 0.4 ppmv yr−1 in CMIP5 and 0.3 ppmv yr−1 in CMIP6 for the multi-model mean, with a good reproduction of the interannual variability.

1016202," A significant proportion of the uncertainty in climate projections arises from uncertainty in the representation of land carbon uptake. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) vary in their representations of regrowth and competition for resources, which results in differing responses to changes in atmospheric CO2 and climate. More advanced cohort-based patch models are now becoming established in the latest DGVMs. These models typically attempt to simulate the size distribution of trees as a function of both tree size (mass or trunk diameter) and age (time since disturbance). This approach can capture the overall impact of stochastic disturbance events on the forest structure and biomass – but at the cost of increasing the number of parameters and ambiguity when updating the probability density function (pdf) in two dimensions. Here we present the Robust Ecosystem Demography (RED), in which the pdf is collapsed onto the single dimension of tree mass. RED is designed to retain the ability of more complex cohort DGVMs to represent forest demography, while also being parameter sparse and analytically solvable for the steady state. The population of each plant functional type (PFT) is partitioned into mass classes with a fixed baseline mortality along with an assumed power-law scaling of growth rate with mass.

It is found to span a large range even at the Paris Agreement Target of 2◦C global warming. We use the spatial variability of τs inferred from observations to obtain a constraint on ∆Cs,τ .

Since instrumental records do not capture the full range of past or projected climate scenarios, natural archives from warmer periods in the past can be used to identify responses to forcing and modes of climate variability, which provides a comparison to long-term projected simulations.

1016240,"Understanding the mechanisms behind the carbon cycle response to extreme events is essential for predicting future behaviour of tropical forests. In this study, we focus on the modelled response during the 2010 drought in the Amazon forest using a suite of dynamic global vegetation models. The potential impacts of drought on the carbon cycle include increased mortality, reduced productivity, and changes to heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration rates. In addition, the 2010 drought was accompanied by substantial biomass burning which also emitted CO2 to the atmosphere. Many of these fires were from human ignitions related to deforestation, which can be particularly difficult for models to represent. During the 2000's, the models all showed that the forests of the Amazon basin were a net sink of CO2, with an average net biome productivity, or NBP, of 0.20±0.19 PgC/yr.

WUE is expected to increase with atmospheric CO2, but to decline with increasing atmospheric evaporative demand-which can arise from increases in near-surface temperature or decreases in relative humidity. We have used eddy covariance measurements from the Fluxnet sites, along with d13C measurements from tree rings, to estimate the sensitivities of WUE to changes in CO2 (Ca) and atmospheric humidity deficit (D).

Stomata on plant leaves are the pores through which CO2 is fixed during photosynthesis, and also the pores through which water is returned to the atmosphere as the transpiration flux. Stomata therefore exert considerable control over both the water and carbon cycles. Unfortunately, the long-term responses of stomata to rising CO2 and changes in climate are still rather uncertain, despite their significance for future climate. In contrast, Plant Water Use Efficiency (WUE) which is the ratio of the carbon assimilated through photosynthesis to the water lost through transpiration, is a robust diagnostic of the functioning of the land biosphere that is not directly dependent on the uncertain long-term responses of stomata.

Changes in cloud cover and atmospheric aerosol loadings from either volcanic and anthropogenic sources, modify the total radiation reaching the surface and the fraction of this radiation which is diffuse, with uncertain overall effects on plant productivity and the global land carbon sink.A decrease in total solar radiation (Liepert, 2002, Stanhill and Cohen, 2001, Wild et al., 2005) has been observed at the Earth surface over the 1950-1990 period, called solar dimming. Such dimming gradually started to transform into brightening in some regions of the world since the late 1980s (Wild et al. 2005).

They are coupled to climate models for simulating past, present, and future vegetation cover distribution. Although this type of models normally work on very long time scales, some preliminary studies indicate DVMs also have impact on simulation of water and energy cycle at seasonal to interannual scales.However, thus far, DVMs were mostly evaluated for their simulations of vegetation distribution and carbon flux, or for model intercomparison. Sometimes, model-simulated precipitation, surface temperature, or tree ring data was used to indirectly evaluate DVM performance. The systematic testing of this type of models for water and energy cycle studies at seasonal, interannual, and decadal scales using station data has not been reported so far. The vegetation simulated by DGVMs responds primarily to for factors: solar radiation, air temperature, and soil moisture, and atmospheric CO2 concentration. Therefore, an objective, meaningful evaluation should include every important component in the surface water, carbon, and energy cycle, not be based on one or two variables.

For example, changes in surface radiation that lead to increasing diffuse surface irradiance are reported to enhance plant photosynthesis (Gu et al., 2003, Niyogi et al., 2004, Oliveira et al., 2007, Roderick et al., 2001). Solar radiation reaching the land surface has changed over the industrial era due to aerosols emitted from volcanoes and various anthropogenic sources (Kvalevag and Myhre, 2007). Such changes in total surface radiation are accompanied by changes in direct and diffuse surface solar radiation. Recent major volcanic events include the eruptions of el Chichón in 1986 and Mount Pinatubo in 1991.   In this study we estimate the impact of changes in surface radiation on photosynthetic carbon uptake during the Post Pinatubo period.

It has even been suggested that the decrease in the atmospheric [CO2] growth-rate after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, was caused by such an enhancement of photosynthetic uptake as volcanic aerosols scattered the incoming sunlight to produce a higher diffuse fraction (Roderick et al. 2001, Gu et al, 2003).In order to assess this hypothesis, we have implemented an improved plant canopy radiation scheme within the JULES land-surface model (as used in the Hadley Centre GCMs).

1016276,"Terrestrial ecosystems influence climate by affecting how much solar energy is absorbed by the land surface and by exchanging climatically important gases with the atmosphere. Recent model analyses show widespread qualitative agreement that terrestrial ecological processes will have a net positive feedback effect on 21st-century global warming, and, therefore, cannot be ignored in climate-change projections. However, the quantitative uncertainty in the net feedback is large. The uncertainty in 21st-century carbon dioxide emissions resulting from terrestrial carbon cycle–climate feedbacks is second in magnitude only to the uncertainty in anthropogenic emissions. We estimate that this translates into an uncertainty in global warming owing to the land surface of 1.5°C by 2100.

1016284,"1 BackgroundFull GCM transient simulations are the best tools available to address the likely impact of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations on surface climate. However, most such models frequently take months of computer time to make a single “transient” simulation representing, say, the period 1860 to 2100 and for a prescribed SRES emission scenario. For this reason, there has been interest in developing “pattern scaling” methods whereby persistent spatial patterns of change observed in GCM simulations for “weather” anomalies (such as local temperature and rainfall) may be exploited. In particular, it allows climate simulations to be made for a broad range of emission scenarios, generating surface climate data that may be used for impacts studies. The method extrapolates the relatively few full GCM transient simulations to new emission scenarios. Many authors have established that the scaling method exhibits a high degree of robustness. For example, see Mitchell et al.,(1999), Huntingford and Cox (2000) and Mitchell (2002).

1016294,"The strength of the coupling between the land and the atmosphere, which controls, for example, the degree to which precipitation-induced soil moisture anomalies affect the overlying atmosphere and thereby the subsequent generation of precipitation, has been examined and quantified with many atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). Generally missing from such studies, however, is an indication of the extent to which the simulated coupling strength is model dependent. Four modeling groups have recently performed a highly controlled numerical experiment that allows an objective intermodel comparison of land–atmosphere coupling strength, focusing on short (weekly down to subhourly) timescales. The experiment essentially consists of an ensemble of 1-month simulations in which each member simulation artificially maintains the same (model specific) time series of surface prognostic variables. Differences in atmospheric behavior between the ensemble members then indicate the degree to which the state of the land surface controls atmospheric processes in that model. A comparison of the four sets of experimental results shows that coupling strength does indeed vary significantly among the AGCMs.",PETER COX and MAXJ SUAREZ+,0,,,,,,Comparing the Degree of Land–Atmosphere Interaction in Four Atmospheric General Circulation Models,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/12824896.pdf,,,,7S1cuNwAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC

Although the climatic linkage between CO2 and ENSO has been modelled, the spatial extent and relative importance of different processes remains uncertain. Here, we use cross-spectral analysis to provide such a differentiation of the various processes depending on region. At the ENSO timescale of 2 to 6 years, gridded records of precipitation and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index–as a proxy for top-leaf photosynthesis-are linked to CO2 in few regions. However, variations in temperature records are coherent with variations in CO2 over far larger areas including most of the equatorial and southern tropics. A land surface modelling study confirms that temperature and not precipitation provides the dominant areal influence on ENSO-related land CO2 flux fluctuations, especially in the Amazon basin and central Africa.",Graham P Weedon and Chris Huntingford and Sietse O Los and Will MF Grey and Peter M Cox and Chris M Taylor and Nicola Gedney and Stephen SitCH,0,,,,,,Land temperature: a key factor linking the El Niño/Southern Oscillation to multi-year fluctuations in carbon dioxide,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/54d5/552e9ebc3dcb134966fc9e440beca17e3c40.pdf,,,,7S1cuNwAAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C

1016297,"Global CO2 emissions are understood to be the largest contributor to anthropogenic climate change, and have, to date, been highly correlated with economic output. However, there is likely to be a negative feedback between climate change and human wealth: economic growth is typically associated with an increase in CO2 emissions and global warming, but the resulting climate change may lead to damages that suppress economic growth. This climate–economy feedback is assumed to be weak in standard climate change assessments. When the feedback is incorporated in a transparently simple model it reveals possible emergent behaviour in the coupled climate–economy system. Formulae are derived for the critical rates of growth of global CO2 emissions that cause damped or long-term boom–bust oscillations in human wealth, thereby preventing a soft landing of the climate–economy system. On the basis of this model, historical rates of economic growth and decarbonization appear to put the climate–economy system in a potentially damaging oscillatory regime.",Owen Kellie-Smith and Peter M Cox,0,,,,,,Emergent dynamics of the climate,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Cox/publication/49799237_Emergent_dynamics_of_the_climate-economy_system_in_the_Anthropocene/links/0046351e45bdedfa1c000000/Emergent-dynamics-of-the-climate-economy-system-in-the-Anthropocene.pdf,,,,7S1cuNwAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC

1016300,"The twelve weather and climate models participating in the Global Land-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (GLACE) show both a wide variation in the strength of land-atmosphere coupling and some intriguing commonalities. In this paper, we address the causes of variations in coupling strength û both the geographic variations within a given model and the model-to-model differences. The ability of soil moisture to affect precipitation is examined in two stages, namely, the ability of the soil moisture to affect evaporation, and the ability of evaporation to affect precipitation. Most of the differences between the models and within a given model are found to be associated with the first stage û an evaporation rate that varies strongly and consistently with soil moisture tends to lead to a higher coupling strength. The first stage differences reflect identifiable differences in model parameterization and model climate. Intermodel differences in the evaporation-precipitation connection, however, also play a key role.",Zhichang Guo and Paul A Dirmeyer and Randal D Koster and Gordon Bonan and Edmond Chan and Peter Cox and CT Tony Gordon and Shinjiro Kanae and Eva Kowalczyk and David Lawrence and Ping Liu10 and Cheng-Hsuan Lu11 and Sergey Malyshev12 and Bryant McAvaney13 and JL McGregor and Ken Mitchell11 and David Mocko10 and Taikan Oki14 and Keith W Oleson and Andrew Pitman15 and YC Sud and Christopher M Taylor16 and Diana Verseghy and Ratko Vasic17 and Yongkang Xue17 and Tomohito Yamada14,0,,,,,,"* TIME\@"" d MMMM yyyy""* 28 January 20054 January 2005* 1 Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD, 20705, USA 2 NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD …",ftp://monsoondata.org/pub/guo/glace/paper2v16nc.doc,,,,7S1cuNwAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC

1016303,"The last decade has seen growth in understanding of the Earth System along with an increase in uncertainty over its future behaviour. Potentially large cooling from the direct and indirect effects of aerosols offsets the warming forcing from greenhouse gases (GHGs). Substantial uncertainty in the degree of compensation leads to uncertainty in the climate sensitivity required to explain the observed 20th century warming. Gregory et al, Andronova & Schlesinger, try to assess climate sensitivity from observed climate trends but end up with large error bars, largely as a result of uncertainty in the radiative forcing (a big component of which is sulphate aerosol).However, CO2 and SO4 differ in their future behaviour: CO2 resides in the atmosphere for decades to centuries and so it's concentration is dependent on past emissions and what's more, its production is predicted to increase in all but the most optimistic emissions scenarios. Sulphate aerosols on the other hand reside in the atmosphere for just days to weeks and so their concentration is largely determined by the current rates of emission, which is predicted to fall sharply in coming decades driven by air quality measures. Therefore we can expect much reduced cancellation of GHG warming by sulphate cooling throughout the 21st century.",Chris Jones and Peter Cox,0,,,,,,"Impact of uncertainties in sulphate forcing, climate sensitivity and carbon cycle feedbacks on climate projections for the 21st century",http://camels.metoffice.com/MiscReport01.html,,,,7S1cuNwAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC
