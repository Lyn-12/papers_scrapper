0,"Stereolithography is a solid freeform technique (SFF) that was introduced in the late 1980s. Although many other techniques have been developed since then, stereolithography remains one of the most powerful and versatile of all SFF techniques. It has the highest fabrication accuracy and an increasing number of materials that can be processed is becoming available. In this paper we discuss the characteristic features of the stereolithography technique and compare it to other SFF techniques. The biomedical applications of stereolithography are reviewed, as well as the biodegradable resin materials that have been developed for use with stereolithography. Finally, an overview of the application of stereolithography in preparing porous structures for tissue engineering is given.",Ferry PW Melchels and Jan Feijen and Dirk W Grijpma,1502,6541872660049310383,,24,6121-6130,Elsevier,A review on stereolithography and its applications in biomedical engineering,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961210005661,31,2010
1,"This review covers new experimental and theoretical physical research related to the formation of polymeric membranes by phase separation of a polymer solution, and to the morphology of these membranes. Two main phase separation processes for polymeric membrane formation are discussed: thermally induced phase separation and immersion precipitation. Special attention is paid to phase transitions like liquid-liquid demixing, crystallization, gelation, and vitrification, and their relation to membrane morphology. In addition, the mass transfer processes involved in immersion precipitation, and their influence on membrane morphology are discussed.",P Van de Witte and PJ Dijkstra and JWA Van den Berg and J Feijen,1301,13732209564217571805,,1-2,1-31,Elsevier,Phase separation processes in polymer solutions in relation to membrane formation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0376738896000889,117,1996
2,"Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on aqueous solutions of polyCZV-isopropylacrylamide-co-butyl methacrylate-co-X), with X being hydrophilic, hydrophobic, cationic, or anionic comonomers, to elucidate the mechanism of temperature-induced phase separation and the effect of comonomer content, hydrophilicity, and charge on the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The endothermic heat of phase separation, which is related to the breaking of hydrogen bonds between water molecules surrounding hydrophobic moieties on the polymer, was a linear, decreasing function of the LCST. This suggests that the hydrophobic interactions between polymer side groups, which are the major driving force for phase separation, are enhanced at elevated temperatures due to a decrease in the structuring of water around hydrophobic side groups. It is concluded that the changes in LCST caused by the …",Herman Feil and You Han Bae and Jan Feijen and Sung Wan Kim,1132,10538482510930661980,Macromolecules,10,2496-2500,American Chemical Society,Effect of comonomer hydrophilicity and ionization on the lower critical solution temperature of N-isopropylacrylamide copolymers,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ma00062a016,26,1993
3,"In the past decade, polymersomes (also referred to as polymeric vesicles) have attracted rapidly growing interest based on their intriguing aggregation phenomena, cell and virus-mimicking dimensions and functions, as well as tremendous potential applications in medicine, pharmacy, and biotechnology. Unlike liposomes self-assembled from low molecular weight lipids, polymersomes are in general prepared from macromolecular amphiphiles of various architectures including amphiphilic diblock, triblock, graft and dendritic copolymers. Polymersomes exhibit very unique features highlighted with high stability, tunable membrane properties, versatility, and capacity of transporting hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic species such as anticancer drugs, genes, proteins, and diagnostic probes.

5,"In the past few years, protein biochips have emerged as promising proteomic and diagnostic tools for obtaining information about protein functions and interactions. Important technological innovations have been made. However, considerable development is still required, especially regarding protein immobilization, in order to fully realize the potential of protein biochips. In fact, protein immobilization is the key to the success of microarray technology. Proteins need to be immobilized onto surfaces with high density in order to allow the usage of small amount of sample solution. Nonspecific protein adsorption needs to be avoided or at least minimized in order to improve detection performances. Moreover, full retention of protein conformation and activity is a challenging task to be accomplished.

6,"A cross-linking method for collagen-based biomaterials was developed using the water-soluble carbodiimide 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EN). Cross-linking using EDC involves the activation of carboxylic acid groups to give 0-acylisourea groups, which form cross-links after reaction with free amine groups. Treatment of dermal sheep collagen (DSC) with EDC (E-DSC) resulted in materials with an increased shrinkage temperature (T5) and a decreased free amine group content, showing that cross-linking occurred. Addition of N-hydroxysuccinimide to the EDC-containing cross-linking solution (E/N-DSC) increased the rate of cross-linking. Cross-linking increased the 7, of non-cross-linked DSC samples from 56 to 73 C for E-DSC and to 66 C for E/N-DSC samples, respectively. For both cross-linking methods a linear relation between the decrease in free amine group content and the increase in Ts was observed. The tensile strength and the high strain modulus of E/N-DSC samples decreased upon cross-linking from 18 to 15 MPa and from 26 to 16 MPa, respectively. The elongation at break of E/N-DSC increased upon cross-linking from 142 to 180%.",LHH Olde Damink and PJ Dijkstra and MJA Van Luyn and PB Van Wachem and P Nieuwenhuis and J Feijen,882,12014178595900017569,Biomaterials,8,765-773,Elsevier,Cross-linking of dermal sheep collagen using a water-soluble carbodiimide,https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/6862443/Olde_Damink96cross.pdf,17,1996
7,"Meshes of collagen and/or elastin were successfully prepared by means of electrospinning from aqueous solutions. Flow rate, applied electric field, collecting distance and composition of the starting solutions determined the morphology of the obtained fibres. Addition of PEO (M w= 8× 1 0 6) and NaCl was always necessary to spin continuous and homogeneous fibres. Spinning a mixture of collagen and elastin resulted in fibres in which the single components could not be distinguished by SEM. Increasing the elastin content determined an increase in fibres diameters from 220 to 600 nm. The voltage necessary for a continuous production of fibres was dependent on the composition of the starting solution, but always between 10 and 25 kV. Under these conditions, non-woven meshes could be formed and a partial orientation of the fibres constituting the mesh was obtained by using a rotating tubular mandrel as …",Laura Buttafoco and Nico G Kolkman and Paula Engbers-Buijtenhuijs and Andreas A Poot and Pieter J Dijkstra and Istvan Vermes and Jan Feijen,661,13610862239659866655,Biomaterials,5,724-734,Elsevier,Electrospinning of collagen and elastin for tissue engineering applications,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961205005910,27,2006
8,The in vitro interaction of human endothelial cells (HEC) and polymers with different wettabilities in culture medium containing serum was investigated. Optimal adhesion of HEC generally occurred onto moderately wettable polymers. Within a series of cellulose type of polymers the cell adhesion increased with increasing contact angle of the polymer surfaces. Proliferation of HEC occurred when adhesion was followed by progressive flattening of the cells.,PB Van Wachem and T Beugeling and Jan Feijen and A Bantjes and JP Detmers and WG Van Aken,636,13936616111210333494,Biomaterials,6,403-408,Elsevier,Interaction of cultured human endothelial cells with polymeric surfaces of different wettabilities,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.987.9631&rep=rep1&type=pdf,6,1985
9,"The formation of Schiff bases during crosslinking of dermal sheep collagen (DSC) with glutaraldehyde (GA), their stability and their reactivity towards GA was studied. All available free amine groups had reacted with GA to form a Schiff base within 5 min after the start of the reaction under the conditions studied (0.5% (w/w) GA). Before crosslinks are formed the hydrolysable Schiff bases initially present were stabilized by further reaction with GA molecules. An increase in shrinkage temperature (T s) from 56°C for non-crosslinked DSC (N-DSC) to 78°C for GA crosslinked DSC (G-DSC) was achieved after crosslinking for 1 h. From the relationship between the free amine group content and the T s during crosslinking it was concluded that higher GA concentrations and longer reaction times will result in the introduction of pendant-GA-related molecules rather than crosslinks.

The fibrils were deposited on glass substrates that are partly coated with Teflon AF®. A modified AFM tip was used to accurately deposit epoxy glue droplets on either end of the collagen fibril that cross the glass‐Teflon AF® interface, as to such attach it with one end to the glass and the other end to the AFM tip. Single collagen fibrils have been mechanically tested in ambient conditions and were found to behave reversibly up to stresses of 90 MPa. Within this regime a Young's modulus of 2–7 GPa was obtained. In aqueous media, the collagen fibrils could be tested reversibly up to about 15 MPa, revealing Young's moduli ranging from 0.2 to at most 0.8 GPa.

In the early 1950's, serious environmental problems were iden tified with the discovery of the persistence of chlori nated pesticides in the ecosystem, ably pUblicized by Rachel Carson in her book, The Si lent Spring. About the same time, the widespread use of automatic dish washers and laundry machines required the use of syn thetic detergents in place of conventional soaps. These early detergents were not completely degraded in municipal sewage plants, and caused foaming and other related problems in the downstream water effluent. As a result, soap companies quickly developed so-called"" biodegradable"" detergents in which the branched alkyl chains used in detergent synthesis were replaced by linear alkanes, thus accelerating the rate of biodegra dation of these compounds in the biologically active sewage process. The success of this new chemistry gave t-be impression to the general pUblic that something that was"" biodegradable"" was inherently good for the natural environment.This simplistic notion gained further momentum as a result of an advertising campaign initiated by the paper industry about the same time, in a desperate at tempt to retain their markets in the packaging industry against the expanding use of plastics.

Development of simple, convenient initiators for controlled ring-opening polymerization of cyclic esters is important from a practical as well as a fundamental point of view. Recently, it was reported that trivalent rare earth alkoxides can initiate living polymerization of monomers such as ϵ-caprolactone, lactide, and-butyrolactone with activities unprecedented in coordination polymerization of these monomers. 1-5 We now report a highly efficient catalyst system for the preparation of polyesters based on lanthanide tris (2, 6-di-tert-butylphenolate) s and various alcohols, allowing excellent control over molecular weight and end-group identity.

A prerequisite for further development is the design and synthesis of novel multifunctional biomaterials that are biocompatible and biologically active, are biodegradable with a controlled degradation rate, and have tunable mechanical properties. In the past decades, different types of α-amino acid-containing degradable polymers have been actively developed with the aim to obtain biomimicking functional biomaterials. The use of α-amino acids as building units for degradable polymers may offer several advantages: (i) imparting chemical functionality, such as hydroxyl, amine, carboxyl, and thiol groups, which not only results in improved hydrophilicity and possible interactions with proteins and genes, but also facilitates further modification with bioactive …",Huanli Sun and Fenghua Meng and Aylvin A Dias and Marc Hendriks and Jan Feijen and Zhiyuan Zhong,177,9683543236385288211,,6,1937-1955,American Chemical Society,"α-Amino acid containing degradable polymers as functional biomaterials: rational design, synthetic pathway, and biomedical applications",https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bm200043u,12,2011

The ability of CNS to produce slime has been suggested to play a critical role in the adhesion onto surfaces of implants and medical devices [2] and in the course of medical device-associated infections [3]. Staphylococcus aureus, the pathogenic counterpart of CNS, can be encapsulated [4]. Such strains possessed increased virulence in comparison with their non-encapsulated variant strains [5, 6]. Characterization of CNS has been advocated [7, 8], but no special attention has been given to the presence of a capsule, although encapsulated CNS have been reported [9]. Bacterial adhesion onto surfaces is also regarded to be an important virulence factor [10]. Bacterial interaction with mammalian cells and artificial surfaces is promoted by the hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell surface [11-13].

Immobilization of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to substrates used to coat or fill porous prostheses may enhance the formation of a confluent monolayer of ECs. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were grown on bFGF‐loaded albumin–heparin conjugate bound to CO2 gas‐plasma‐treated polystyrene. In the order of 2–3 ng/cm2 bFGF had to be immobilized to form a confluent monolayer of HUVECs. The most prominent effect of surface‐immobilized bFGF was stimulation of the proliferation shortly after seeding, resulting within 3 days in confluent cell monolayers with high density.

168,"Polymers and copolymers of different methacrylates were synthesized and coated on glass slides. The surfaces of the polymer films were characterized by their water contact angles and~"" potentials using the Wilhelmy plate technique and streaming potential measurements, respectively. From contactangle measurements information was also obtained about mobility of surface polymer chains. Receding contact angles of methyl methacrylate (MMA) copolymers containing hydrophilic or charged units were decreased as compared to the MMA homopolymer. When charged hydroxyethyi methacrylate (HEMA) copolymers were compared with the HEMA homopolymer, the advancing contact angles increased, probably due to reorientation of surface polymer chains. The receding contact angles of poly (alkyl methacrylates) first increased and then decreased with increasing side-chain lengths. These changes were related to the mobility of the different polymers. Incorporation of positively or negatively charged groups in MMA or HEMA polymers accordingly changed the~"" potential of the polymers.© 1985 Academic Press, Inc.",AH Hogt and DE Gregonis and JD Andrade and SW Kim and J Dankert and Jan Feijen,88,7680538253423388078,Journal of colloid and interface science,2,289-298,Academic Press,Wettability and ζ potentials of a series of methacrylate polymers and copolymers,https://research.utwente.nl/files/6881087/Hogt85wettability.pdf,106,1985

193,"Highly transparent (>80%) and conductive layers (10-6 S/cm) were obtained by the pulsed plasma polymerization of thiophene. The influence of power, pressure, pulse time, duty cycle, and position in the reactor on the conductivity of the resulting plasma polymerized thiophene (PPT) layers was evaluated. In the used ranges, only pressure had a significant influence on the conductivity of the deposited layer. The results could be correlated to the effect of the deposition parameters on the fragmentation of the thiophene monomer. At high pressure there was less fragmentation of thiophene, resulting in a higher conductivity of the layer. It was shown that the use of a pulsed plasma as a means to minimize fragmentation is most efficient when the off time is chosen such that the reactor is replenished with new monomer during the off period.

The unique properties of poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (N-isopropylacrylamide)(PEG-PNIPAAm) block and graft copolymers in water have recently attracted a lot of attention. 1-3 Part of the interest concerns the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAAm in water that can be tuned close to body temperature by copolymerization and may therefore be applied in the biomedical field as a stimulus-sensitive material.

For an intermediate block ratio (66/33), the stereocomplex form is obtained at high crystallization temperatures while a coexistence region with homocrystal phase exists at low temperatures. In addition to the transition enthalpy, size effects and kinetic routes play a role in the competition between the stereocomplex and the homocrystalline forms.

238,"Synthetic biodegradable polymers are of great value for the preparation of implants that are required to reside only temporarily in the body. The use of biodegradable polymers obviates the need for a second surgery to remove the implant, which is the case when a nondegradable implant is used. After implantation in the body, biomedical devices may be subjected to degradation and erosion. Understanding the mechanisms of these processes is essential for the development of biomedical devices or implants with a specific function, for example, scaffolds for tissue-engineering applications. For the engineering and regeneration of soft tissues (e.g., blood vessels, cardiac muscle and peripheral nerves), biodegradable polymers are needed that are flexible and elastic. The scaffolds prepared from these polymers should have tuneable degradation properties and should perform well under long-term cyclic deformation …",Erhan Bat and Zheng Zhang and Jan Feijen and Dirk W Grijpma and André A Poot,60,7184103300088592517,Regenerative medicine,3,385-398,Future Medicine Ltd,Biodegradable elastomers for biomedical applications and regenerative medicine,https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/abs/10.2217/rme.14.4,9,2014

240,"Glutaraldehyde fixation of bioprosthetic tissue has been used successfully for almost 40 years. However, it is generally recognized that glutaraldehyde fixation of bioprostheses is associated with the occurrence of calcification. Accordingly, many efforts have been undertaken to develop techniques for the fixation of bioprostheses, which will not lead to calcification. Here we describe a new improved carbodiimide based cross-linking method. Rather than cross-linking the tissue through its free primary amine groups, these groups were first blocked with butanal and the tissue was then cross-linked by means of carbodiimide activation of tissue carboxylic acid groups followed by a reaction with a poly(propylene glycol)bis 2-(aminopropyl) ether, (Jeffamine™).

Characterization with electrophoresis on polyacryl gel and immunoelectrophoresis did not reveal differences between labeled and nonlabeled HSA. The release of the label from labeled proteins in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was studied as a function of time. 125I-labeled proteins were stable and 99mTc-labeled proteins showed different stabilities depending on the labeling method which was used. The adsorption behavior of labeled HSA and HSA onto polystyrene (PS) and silicon rubber (SR) was studied by using two methods. It appeared that all labeled HSA compounds showed a preferential adsorption onto PS (and SR) substrates. The 99mTc-labeled HSA showed a high value of the preferential adsorption factor (φ ⪢ 1).

Human plasma fibronectin was shown to bind heparins in both the solution and adsorbed states. Fibronectin was shown to have six active binding sites for heparins which may be stericaUy blocked in some adsorbed states. 125I-Fibronectin monolayer concentrations were shown to be significantly different on polyvinyl chloride surfaces when compared to hydrophilic/hydrophobic silica, Biomer, Silastic, and polystyrene surfaces. Preadsorbing fibronectin to various substrates and then allowing heparins to interact with the protein monolayer made it possible to bind up to 0.2 t~ g/cm 2 heparin in a plasma environment. This fibronectin-heparin complex was at least 85% stable in plasma and buffer solutions for up to 8 h time. The complex was observed to prolong blood clotting times two to three times over that of controls as assayed by Activated Partial Thromboplastin Times. All of the bound heparin was observed to be active by its ability to bind Factor X, in plasma. Monolayers of blood proteins adsorbed from human serum were not observed to be active in binding heparins.

307,"In order to introduce carboxylic acid groups at the surface of poly(ethylene) (PE) films, an attempt was made to covalently link a preadsorbed layer of poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) on a PE film by an argon or tetrafluoromethane (CF4) plasma treatment. Surface analysis was performed by XPS (X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and water contact angle measurements. It was shown that by treatment of a PAAc layer preadsorbed on PE with an argon or a CF4 plasma, a small amount of carboxylic acid groups was introduced at the surface. A similar amount of these groups was obtained by plasma treatment of PE films without a preadsorbed PAAc layer. A comparison of the etching rates of PAAc and PE by either an argon or a CF4 plasma, showed that PAAc is etched much faster by both types of plasmas than PE.

Interventions of distal left main (LM) disease generally require stenting across the LM bifurcation with inherent vessel tapering along this segment and a high likelihood of stent malapposition, which can be avoided by such postdilations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen DES (four 3.5 mm-samples of Cypher Select Plus, Taxus Liberté, Endeavor Resolute, Xience V) were deployed in water; 12 samples were then proximally postdilated with noncompliant 5.0 mm balloons at 18 atm. All samples were examined by micro-computed tomography. Taxus Liberté, Endeavor Resolute, and Xience V, showed increased cell areas in the transitional region (just distal to postdilated region), while Cypher Select showed its largest cells inside the postdilated region. Overall, the largest maximum cell area was observed in Endeavor Resolute, while Cypher Select showed the smallest (p< 0.001, for both). In addition, the size of the very proximal postdilated cells was relatively small in most DES except Xience V.

The hydrophilicity of the networks could by varied by mixing NVP and VAc at different ratios. The prepared network extracts were compatible with NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.

Young's moduli of single elastic fibers immersed in water, devoid of or containing fibrillin–microfibrils, were determined using bending tests. Bending freely suspended elastic fibers on a micro-channeled substrate by a tip-less AFM cantilever generated a force versus displacement curve from which Young's moduli were calculated. For single elastic fibers, Young's moduli in the range of 0.3–1.5 MPa were determined, values not significantly affected by the presence of fibrillin–microfibrils.

Endothelial cells lining the inner side of blood vessels can provide the graft lumen with an antithrombogenic surface. One of the remaining problems is cell detachment after restoration of blood flow, because of infiltration of leukocytes that respond to an inflammatory‐like activation of the endothelial cells. This endothelial activation is possibly caused by the surface characteristics of the underlying polymer. To get more insight into the effects of the polymer surface on endothelial cell activation, we seeded human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in various densities and subsequently grew them on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS; hydrophilic) and polystyrene (PS; hydrophobic) surfaces.

For rapidly crystallizing polymers, solid–liquid demixing processes also generate porous morphologies. In this study, the interference of both phase transitions has been analyzed theoretically using the Flory–Huggins theory for ternary polymer solutions. It is demonstrated that four main thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are important for the structure formation in solution: the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization, the ratio of the molar volumes of the solvent and the nonsolvent, the polymer–solvent interaction parameter, and the rate of crystallization of the polymer compared to the rate of solvent‐nonsolvent exchange.

After exposing polymer films to high pressure CO2, the wave number of the absorption maxima of the polymer carbonyl groups shifted to higher values. Also, due to the interaction between CO2 and the carbonyl groups of the polymers, a new broad peak in the bending mode region of CO2 appeared.

The development of synthetic pathways and catalyst/initiator systems to produce pre-designed polylactides, as well as the fundamental understanding of the  polymerization reactions, has continuously been an important topic. Here, we will address the recent advances in the ring-opening polymerization of lactides, with an emphasis on the highly versatile in situ generated initiator systems and single-site stereoselective initiators. The in  situ generated initiators including in situ formed yttrium, calcium and zinc alkoxides all have been shown to bring about a rapid and living polymerization of lactides under mild conditions, which facilitated the preparation of a variety of advanced lactide-based biomaterials.

The iodine doping process of PPT layers deposited at high (HP) and low (LP) pressure has been studied in detail. Doping time, thickness, and exposure time to air before and after doping were varied. Iodine doping generates charge carriers by the formation of charge transfer (CT) complexes, which are in equilibrium with absorbed iodine. The conductivity of the LP-PPT layers decreases with increasing thickness due to (vacuum-) UV modification.

One of the reasons for this is that the technology combines poorly with standard cell biological and biochemical analysis tools. Flow cytometry is an example of a conventional analytical tool that is considered to be incompatible with microfluidic technology and its inherent small sample sizes. In this study, it is shown that properly designed microfluidic devices contain cell populations that are large enough to be analyzed by flow cytometry. To illustrate this, the uptake of fluorescent human low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) by human endothelial cells that were cultured in a microfluidic channel was analyzed. It was found that the uptake of LDL by the cells increased linearly over time. Moreover, the uptake decreased when cells were pretreated with fluid shear stress inside the microfluidic devices.

500,"The anthracycline antibiotics daunomycin and 14-hydroxydaunomycin (adriamycin) have been shown to be very effective in the treatment of a number of malignancies (1). Besides the non-specific side-effects of cytostatic agents, adriamycin exerts a specific toxic activity on the heart (2). This side effect may eventually lead to a life-threatening congestive heart failure when a cumulative dose of 550 mg.m-2 has been exceeded. Although the exact mechanism through which toxicity develops has not been elucidated, three major hypotheses on the pathogenesis of adriamycin induced cardiotoxicity have been postulated. As all quinones, adriamycin is a potent chelating agent for divalent cations, in particular for Ca2+ which is involved in the excitation-contraction coupling of muscle cells (3).

534,"Collagen-based biomaterials are usually stabilized either by physical or chemical crosslinking to control the rate of biodegradation of the material, to suppress its antigenicity and to improve the mechanical properties.  Several chemical crosslinking methods for collagen-based biomaterials are known.  In principal these methods can be divided into two groups.  The use of bifunctional reagents to bridge free amine groups of lysine or hydroxylysine residues on different polypeptide chains has long been used.  Glutaraldehyde crosslinking is the most extensively studied and is a frequently applied method for the stabilization of collagen-based biomaterials.  The major disadvantage of this approach is that toxic reagents are introduced in the material which upon release can result in cytotoxic reactions in both in vitro and in vivo application. Hexamethylene diisocyanate and (poly)epoxy compounds are bi(poly)functional compounds that have been studied as an alternative to glutaraldehyde crosslinking.Crosslinking can also be achieved by activation of the carboxylic acid groups of glutamic and aspartic acid residue followed by reaction with an amine group of another polypeptide chain to give an amide bond.  This concept was already introduced in the early 80's by the use of cyanamide as an activating agent for the crosslinking of reconstituted collagen.  The major advantage of such an approach is that no (toxic) reagents are introduced in or may be released from the material.  Based on this idea a crosslinking method has been developed using a water soluble carbodiimide to activate carboxylic acid groups of the polypeptide chains.

538,In this course the development and application of biodegradable polymers for medical purposes will be discussed. It has been argued by Williams (1) that the degradation effects normally found with materials in the physiological environment cannot be considered as ‘true’ biodegradation unless they involve some specific vital activity of that environment. Thus by this definition any degradation mechanism in polymers that is completely reproducible in an equivalent nonvital medium is not biodegradation.

550,"Most biogradable polymers have been designed to have hydrolytically instable bonds in the polymer backbone. By cleavage of these labile bonds, the generally water-insoluble macromolecules are converted into water soluble oligomers. This process may occur in the bulk of the material as well as at the surface depending on the hydrophobicity of the polymeric backbone and stability towards hydrolysis of the functional groups incorporated.

Endothelial cells are highly responsive to the mechanical stimulus of fluid shear stress that is exerted by blood flowing over their surface. In this study, the immediate micromechanical response of endothelial cells to physiological shear stress was characterized by tracking of ballistically injected, sub-micron, fluorescent particles. It was found that the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the particles decreases by a factor 1.5 within 10 min after the onset of shear stress. This decrease in particle motion is transient, since the MSD returns to control values within 15–30 min after the onset of shear.

577,New heparin-immobilized polyurethaneurea surfaces utilizing hydrophilic spacer systems have been developed for in situ surface modification. Surface modification both by hydrophilic grafting of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and PEO-heparin as well as by heparinized amphiphilic block copolymer coatings significantly improves the nonthrombogenicity of the polyurethaneurea surface without changing the bulk mechanical properties. Heparin immobilization by grafting and coating provides levels of bioactivity that are successful in suppressing contact activation of the intrinsic cascade as well as inhibiting platelet adhesion in vitro.

581,"The first event after contact of polymeric surfaces with blood is the adsorption of proteins at the solid-liquid interface. Thereafter processes like the activation of the intrinsic coagulation, adhesion and aggregation of platelets and the activation of the complement system may take place, depending on the composition of the adsorbed protein layer and the conformation of the adsorbed proteins (Fig. 1). The composition of the adsorbed protein layer usually changes as a function of the exposure time. To obtain more insight in the relation between the character of the polymer surface and it’s blood compatibility, protein adsorption has to be studied on series of polymers with well characterized surface structures. Several types of interactions between the protein and surface such as hydropholic, ionic and donor-acceptor interactions may take place in (Fig. 2). These interactions also determine whether changes in the conformation of the protein molecules will occur upon or after adsorption.

590,"The anthracycline antibiotics daunomycin and 14-hydroxydaunomycin (adriamycin, ADR) have been shown to be very effective in the treatment of a number of malignancies (1, 2). Besides the non--specific side effects of cytostatic agents, adriamycin exerts a specific toxic activity on the heart which may eventually lead to a life-threatening congestive heart failure when a cumulative dose of 550 mg/m2 has been exceeded (1, 2). To effect a decrease in cardiotoxicity we are developing adriamycin-polymer conjugates which are not taken up by heart muscle cells but are readily incorporated in tumor cells. After internalization of a macromolecular substance by endocytosis a phagosome is formed which is then fused with a lysozome (Fig. 1). The substance is then exposed to many digestive enzymes at an acidic pH (4-5)(3).

607,"In the search for biomaterials that are both versatile and compatible with human-tissues, considerable interest has been maintained in collagen-based preparations for the repair and replacement of soft body tissues such as tendons, skin, vascular grafts and heart valves. The general properties of collagen which make this protein interesting as a biomaterial include the high strength of the fibers, low extensibility, minimal antigenicity, its suitability as a substrate for cell growth, and its controllable stability by chemical or physical cross-linking [1]. During in vivo applications, collagen is prone to enzymatic attack which can result in rapid degradation of the material. Therefore, collagen-based materials are frequently stabilized by crosslinking to control the rate of biodegradation. In addition, cross-linking is effective in suppressing the antigenicity of collagen and can improve the mechanical properties [1-4]. However, crosslinking of collagen-based tissues enhances the tendency to calcify, which is the main cause of failure of for example tissue heart valves [5, 6]. In this article, the structure of collagen will be discussed. Thereafter, the cross-linking methods known and the effects on calcification and material properties are given. A collagen-based material, the porcine aortic heart valve, is described in more detail. Finally, a survey of factors which induce calcification and the strategies which were carried out to prevent calcification are reviewed.",R Zeeman and PJ Dijkstra and PB van Wachem and MJA van Luyn and M Hendriks and PT Cahalan and J Feijen,3,11144941461693251594,Cross-linking of collagen-based materials,,,,Cross-linking and calcification of collagen-based materials,https://research.utwente.nl/files/6078087/t000000b.pdf#page=17,,1998

609,"In-vitro degradation of dermal sheep collagen (DSC) cross-linked with 1, 4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDGE) for various times and at different pH's was studied with either bacterial collagenase or pronase. Cross-linking of DSC at pH 4.5 resulted in a reaction between the carboxylic acid groups of collagen and epoxide groups of BDDGE. Even after cross-linking for 10 d, the materials degraded slowly in a collagenase solution and somewhat faster with pronase. Cross-linking at pH 9.0 or 10.0 involves amine groups of collagen and epoxide groups of BDDGE. After 72 h of cross-linking at pH 9.0, stable materials were obtained. Cross-linking at pH 10.0 yielded already stable materials after reaction for 6 h. The rates of degradation were correlated with the shrinkage temperature (Ts) of the materials. A high Ts corresponds with a low rate of degradation. DSC cross-linked with BDDGE at pH 4.5 for 10 d had a tensile strength of 5.4 MPa, an elongation at break of 159% and a high strain modulus of 5.2 MPa. Degradation with collagenase for 24 h did not affect the tensile strength to a large extent, but exposure to a pronase solution for 24 h revealed that the materials had no mechanical strength left. BDDGE cross-linked collagen at pH 9.0 for 10 d had a tensile strength of 2.4 MPa, a low elongation at break of 101%, and a high strain modulus of 3.4 MPa. However, these values were hardly affected by exposure to either collagenase or pronase. The differences between BD45 and BD90 are explained in terms of intra-and interhelical cross-links and by inter (micro) fibrillar cross-links. BD90 is the most suitable material in load-bearing applications, while …",R Zeeman and PJ Dijkstra and PB van Wachem and MJA van Luyn and M Hendriks and PT Cahalan and J Feijen,3,8728997439338129444,Cross-Linking of collagen-based materials,,30,,"In vitro degradation of dermal sheep collagen cross-linked with 1, 4-butanediol diglycidyl ether",https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/6078087/t000000b.pdf#page=81,,1998

Sterilization of heparinized Cuprophan by means of EtO exposure and gamma irradiation induced a slight, insignificant decrease of the anticoagulant activity. In contrast, steam-sterilized heparinized Cuprophan showed a higher anticoagulant activity than unsterilized heparinized Cuprophan, which was most likely caused by cleavage of some of the covalent bonds between heparin and Cupropha.

These proteins are key components of the extracellular matrix in the natural vessel wall.

To improve the mechanical properties, the scaffolds were cross-linked by means of a non-cytotoxic method introducing intermolecular peptide bonds. SMCs from umbilical cords were seeded in the scaffolds using a filtration seeding method and subsequently cultured during 14 days under dynamic conditions in a pulsatile flow bioreactor, or under stationary conditions as control. Dynamically cultured constructs contained 2.5 times more SMCs and the cellular expression of collagen type I mRNA was 2-fold increased, as compared to the controls. Only in the case of dynamic culturing, the SMCs were homogeneously distributed in the wall of the scaffolds. Although dynamic culturing significantly improved the mechanical properties of the constructs, the maximum strength in the radial direction was still 50-fold lower than that of a porcine carotid artery (9-12).To improve the mechanical properties of the constructs, we started to use the synthetic polymer poly (trimethylene carbonate)(PTMC) as material for the preparation of scaffolds.

637,"The osteochondral defect is a classical model for a multiple-tissue problem[1]. Tissue engineering of either bone or cartilage imposes different demands on a scaffold concerning porosity, pore size and interconnectivity. Furthermore, local release of tissue-specific growth factors necessitates a tailored architecture. For the fabrication of an osteochondral scaffold with region specific architecture, an advanced technique is required. Stereolithography is a rapid prototyping technique that allows for the creation of such 3D polymer objects with well-defined architecture. Its working principle is the partial irradiation of a resin, causing a liquid-solid transition. By irradiating this resin by a computer-driven light source, a solid 3D object is constructed layer by layer. To make biodegradable polymers applicable in stereolithography, low-molecular weight polymers have to be functionalised with double bonds to enable photo-initiated crosslinking.",FPW Melchels and Dirk W Grijpma and Jan Feijen,2,16904803537146364457,,,,,Fabrication of osteochondral scaffolds with stereolithography,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/38871/,,2005

639,"Two-ply tubes consisting of an inner layer based on poly (1, 3-trimethylene carbonate), poly (TMC) and an outer layer based on a copolymer TMC and ε-caprolactone (CL) with 11 mol% TMC were prepared for guided nerve tissue regeneration. A microporous inner layer (pore size range 1-13 μm) was obtained by dip-coating techniques used in combination with porosifying agents. A macroporous outer layer (pore size range 15-265 μm) was prepared by winding of fibers spun from solution. The mechanical properties and in vivo performance of these conduits in the correction of 6 mm gaps in the rat sciatic nerve model were compared to two-ply tubes with a non-porous inner layer. Both these two-ply nerve guides bent easily without kinking and showed excellent handling characteristics during surgery. Electrophysiological examinations revealed that the contact between the proximal and distal nerve ends was reestablished in both animal groups treated with the two-ply nerve guides. The nerve fibers regenerated through the artificial grafts showed mean conduction velocities similar to nerve fibers regenerated through autografts. These results indicate that two-ply nerve guides based on TMC and CL (co) polymers can serve as a support for axonal guidance. The use of a microporous poly (TMC) inner layer instead of a non-porous layer had no effect on the outcome of the nerve regeneration process.",AP Pêgo and CLAM VLEGGEERT–LANKAMP and EAJF Lakke and E Marani and RTWM Thomeer and AA Poot and DW Grijpma and J Feijen,2,16162100865755420268,Biodegradable polymers based on trimethylene carbonate for tissue engineering applications,,201,,Preparation and in vivo performance of degradable two-ply nerve guides based on (co) polymers of trimethylene carbonate and ε-caprolactone,https://research.utwente.nl/files/6073183/thesis_Pego.pdf#page=213,,2002

643,"Porcine aortic heart valves which consist of three leaflets that are anchored in the aortic wall, were characterized with respect to tissue and amino acid composition. The structural proteins elastin and collagen constitute less than 55% of the dry weight of the aortic wall. Other components are glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans and smooth muscle cells. Aortic leaflets contain a high content of collagen and elastin (72%). Amino acid analysis revealed that the presence of (glyco) proteins and proteoglycans resulted in relatively high contents of arginine, serine, glutamic and aspartic acid, and threonine.Glutaraldehyde cross-linking of aortic leaflets was completed in 1 h and resulted in an increase in the shrinkage temperature (Ts) from 61 to 85 C. Cross-links were formed between the (hydroxy) lysine residues, but after prolonged reaction times, predominantly one-sided (masking) reactions took place. Cross-linking with 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) resulted after 4 h in a material with a high shrinkage temperature of 88 C and a decrease in amine groups to 58%. Reaction of aortic leaflets with 1, 4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDGE) could be achieved under acidic (pH 4.5) conditions or under basic conditions (pH> 8.0), yielding cross-links between the carboxylic acid groups or the amine groups, respectively.

648,"The design of materials for specific biomedical applications has rapidly expanded during the last 20 years. Biomaterials are generally divided into polymeric materials, ceramics and metals. Ceramics and metals are mainly used for the replacement of hard tissue (orthopaedics), whereas polymeric materials are applied for both the (temporary) replacement of soft and hard tissues. Combinations of different materials are applied in medical devices like catheters, sensors and in artificial organs,(hemodialyzers, oxygenators and artificial hearts). For most applications the surfaces of the materials have to be specifically designed, for instance to prevent thrombus formation when the materials are exposed to blood, to prevent adverse tissue reactions after implantation and to prevent infections when the materials are used for extended periods in the body.A specific field of interest is the use of polymeric materials or polymers in solution for pharmaceutical applications.

664,"Most of the currently available calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) convert after application in a bone defect into apatite, which is a calcium phosphate phase that is similar to the inorganic part of bone. A disadvantage of this end-product is its high stability and therefore this material shows only a slow osteoclast depending resorption in time (1). Although, a faster degrading brushite cement (2-3) can be selected to solve this problem, another approach is the introduction of macroporosity (4) into the apatite cement. The consequential increase of surface area results in an increased resorption of the cement. Macroporosity can be generated by the addition of foaming agents to the cement such as sodium bicarbonate (5-6), bovine serum albumin (7), water solvable crystals (8) and by the introduction of biodegradadable microspheres (9-11). This last method has the advantage that the mechanical strength of the microspheres contributes to the initial strength of the ceramic scaffold (12). Additionally, these microspheres can be applied as drug delivery vehicle for osteoinductive growth factors (10). Previous studies have already shown that indeed injectable and setting CPCs can be produced upon the introduction of microspheres composed of poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid)(PLGA)(12), gelatin (13) and poly (trimethylene carbonate)(PTMC)(14). In vitro incubation of these composites in phosphate buffered saline or enzyme containing media (12, 14, 15) results in an interconnected, macroporous calcium phosphate matrix after microsphere degradation.

668,"A new micromechanical technique was developed to study the mechanical properties of single collagen fibrils. Single collagen fibrils, the basic components of the collagen fiber, have a characteristic highly organized structure. Fibrils were isolated from collagenous materials and their mechanical properties were studied with atomic force microscopy (AFM). In this study, we determined the Young’s modulus of single collagen fibrils at ambient conditions from bending tests after depositing the fibrils on a poly (dimethyl siloxane)(PDMS) substrate containing micro-channels. Force-displacement relationships of freely suspended collagen fibrils were determined by loading them with a tip-less cantilever. From the deflection-piezo displacement curve, force-displacement curves could be deduced. With the assumption that the behavior of collagen fibrils follows the model describing the bending of isotropic materials and that the fibrils were freely supported at the rims, a Young’s modulus of 5.4±1.2 GPa was determined. After cross-linking with glutaraldehyde, the Young’s modulus of a single fibril increased to 14.7±2.7 GPa.

The degree of swelling (DS) in water varied from 11 to 1650 wt% and depended on the PEG/PLLA ratio of the network, and to a lesser extent on the crosslink density. The DS of the prepared hydrogels decreased with increasing temperatures, due to the partial dehydration of PEG in water at higher temperatures. Degradation of the networks in PBS buffer at 37 C led to an increase of the DS and a decrease in the dry mass of the network with time.

670,"Tensile properties of individual collagen fibrils of approximately 200 nm in diameter were determined using a slightly adapted AFM system. After depositing fibrils from a dilute suspension on glass substrates which were partially coated with Teflon, an individual collagen fibril was selected and fixed between the AFM cantilever and the glass substrate for tensile testing. An additional calibrated piezo tube which can extend up to 400 μm was added to allow stretching of collagen fibrils up to failure. At ambient conditions a linear stress-strain behavior of the collagen fibrils was found. The mechanical behavior was reversible up to a maximum stress of 80±20 MPa, and a Young’s modulus of 2.5±0.9 GPa was determined from the stress-strain curve. When fibrils were loaded at higher stresses, hysteresis resulting from the viscoelastic properties of collagen was observed. Subsequent loading and unloading cycles revealed a permanent lengthening of the fibril after each cycle. When performing tensile tests of fibrils immersed in PBS buffer, a non-linear stress-strain behavior was found up to a stress of 5 MPa. At higher stresses, the stress-strain curve became linear and a Young’s modulus of 0.6 GPa was calculated. For the first time a failure stress of 0.06±0.01 GPa and a strain at break of 13±2% of individual collagen fibrils in PBS buffer could be determined.

671,"For the fabrication of tissue engineering scaffolds, the intended tissue formation process imposes requirements on the architecture. The chosen porosity often is a tradeoff between volume and surface area accessible to cells, and mechanical properties of the construct. Interconnectivity of the pores is essential for cell migration through the scaffold and for mass transport. Conventional techniques such as salt leaching often result in heterogeneous structures and do not allow for a precise control of the architecture. Stereolithography is a rapid prototyping method that can be utilised to make 3D constructs with high spatial control by radical photopolymerisation. In this study, a regular structure based on cyclic repetition of cell units were designed through CAD modelling.. One of these structures was built on a stereolithography apparatus (SLA). Furthermore, a polylactide-based resin was developed that can be applied in stereolithography. Polylactide has proven before to be a well-performing polymer in bone tissue engineering.

680,"Introduction: Previously, we introduced a quantitative electrophysiological method to compare nerve grafts in vitro. This method was used to evaluate the effect of the presence of pores in biodegradable artificial nerve grafts on regeneration. Pores in an artificial nerve graft will allow easier access of nutrients to the regenerating nerve within the graft, and consequently we expected improved regeneration through the porous grafts compared to the non-porous grafts. Methods: Artificial nerve grafts of porous (1-10 µm pore size; n= 6) and non-porous (n= 6) poly (e-caprolactone)(CL), and of a porous (1-10 µm pore size; n= 6) copolymer of trimethylenecarbonate and e-caprolactone (10: 90 mol%)(TMC/CL) were used to bridge a 6 mm gap in the rat sciatic nerve. Autografted nerves served as controls. Twelve weeks after surgery, increasing stimulus voltages were applied to the (grafted) sciatic nerve in vitro and the resulting compound action currents were measured. This way the maximum charge displaced (Q max), the mean conduction velocity (MCV) and the mean voltage threshold (V 50) were determined. Results: Q max measured in the non-porous nerve grafts was too low to be measured in 5 out of 6 regenerated nerves, and was therefore significantly lower compared to the autografts and porous grafts. There were no significant differences in Q max, MCV and V 50 between the two porous grafts. However, in porous grafts Q max was significantly smaller as compared to the autografted nerves, while MCV and V 50 were not significantly different. Of the two porous grafts the TMC/CL graft provided the best surgical handling capability.

692,In general the chemical composition of surfaces of biomaterials has to be tailored for a specific application. Using different types of glow discharge techniques it is possible to achieve a well defined chemical composition of the surface. Using the plasma immobilization technique it is possible to selectively introduce funtional groups or poly(ethylene oxide) chains on the surface. By using a tetrafluoromethane (CF4) plasma fluorinized surfaces can be obtained. Poly(tetrafluoro ethylene)-like surfaces can be obtained by treating polymer surfaces covered with glass with a CF4 plasma. Furthermore the fluorine introduced by a CF4 plasma treatment can be etched off by an argon plasma treatment in a controlled way. This yields polymer surfaces with a wide range in surface wettability. These surfaces have been evaluated with respect to the adhesion of granulocytes and lymphocytes.,JGA Terlingen and A Bruil and AS Hoffman and J Feijen,1,10527737690038682675,,,38-42,"Springer, Tokyo",Plasma modification of polymeric surfaces for biomedical applications,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-65883-2_8,,1996

694,"Infective endocarditis (IE) usually is studied using animals with catheters inserted into the heart, which causes formation of platelet-fibrin thrombi (vegetations, VGs). We used two rabbit models to study the respective roles of the catheter and the VGs in the development of IE. The influence of the catheter was studied by either removing the catheter before bacterial challenge, or leaving the catheter in place. In all cases, removal of the catheter caused a strong decrease in the frequency of IE. The presence of the catheter stimulated population increase of streptococci within 4 h after challenge. As most catheters were sterile 4 h after challenge, they did not serve as a reservoir of bacteria. To study the requirement of a preformed VG catheters were inserted either 24 h or 30 min before bacterial challenge. In the former model VGs were present, in the latter VGs were not yet formed when bacteria were injected.

697,"Blood compatible polymers and polymer surfaces are gaining attention for application in medical devices and artificial organs. However, when a polymer surface comes in contact with blood several processes that induce thrombus formation become evident. To control, prevent or suppress these processes, several approaches are used. The first approach is concerned about the preparation of polymer surface with a minimal interfacial free energy with blood. On one hand, the second approach aims to attach aliphatic chains to the surface, to establish a preferential adsorption of albumin. With these approaches, it is expected that various heparinization techniques for polymeric surfaces will be developed.",J Feijen,1,2604620949493218956,Macromolecular reports,Suppl 6-7,1153-1160,Marcel Dekker,Design of blood compatible polymers and polymer surfaces,https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/design-of-blood-compatible-polymers-and-polymer-surfaces,31,1994

702,"Protein adsorption of human serum albumin (HSA), human fibrinogen (Fg), human immunoglobulin G (IgG), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) from plasma onto poly (n-alkyl methacrylate)(PAMA) surfaces was measured using a semi-quantitative enzyme-immunoassay. Adsorption was investigated for PAMA (n= 1)(n is the number of C-atoms in the n-alkyl side chain), PAMA (n= 8) and PAMA (n= 18). PAMA (n= 1) has a relatively hydrophilic surface as compared to the more hydrophobic PAMA (n= 8) surface. Both polymers have surface chains which do not reorient after contact with water. The PAMA (n= 18) surface is relatively hydrophobic but in this case polymer surface chains and segments are able to reorient after contact with water. Protein adsorption was measured both as a function of time and as a function of the plasma dilution. If adsorption from plasma was measured as a function of time no exchange of proteins could be observed. The amount of adsorbed protein was always larger in the case of the hydrophobic PAMA (n= 8) as compared to PAMAS (n= 1 and 18), probably due to hydrophobic interactions between the proteins and the PAMA (n= 8) surface. At high plasma concentration relatively large amounts of HDL adsorb onto PAMA (n= 8), indicating that this lipoprotein preferentially adsorbs onto this surface.",HS VAN DAMME and T Beugeling and MT Ratering,1,12516111295400399796,The Vroman Effect,,123,VSP,poly (n-alkyl methacrylate) surfaces,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=21t7MxRMivwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA123&dq=info:tFOY8-gosq0J:scholar.google.com&ots=9zzsDmVpi0&sig=DuYQSMT3BWcrTZ3EcRgKbl5ajEs,,1992

718,"An ideal scientific meeting provides a unique platform that not only facilitates discussion on the cutting-edge technologies and new findings, but also stimulates open and honest debate on critical challenges in the field as well as potential solutions and strategies. Thus, it can guide the future research directions, enlighten and inspire young students and scientists in the community, and provide an avenue and atmosphere for social networking with peers and colleagues. Since its first symposium held in 2010, under the strong and continuous support of our participants and sponsors, the Symposium on Innovative Polymers for Controlled Delivery (SIPCD), also simply known as the Suzhou meeting, has become one of the most prestigious drug delivery meetings. It has grown significantly in the number of participants, and more importantly, in the quality of presentations. SIPCD aims to becoming a high-level conference on biomedical polymers and controlled release technology. As for our previous four symposia, all 29 invited lectures in SIPCD 2018 were given by selected top scientists including editors and associate editors of over 10 prestigious journals. The names of invited speakers and their lecture titles are listed in Table 1.

Microstructured PTMC surfaces were obtained by hot embossing the macromer against structured silicon masters and subsequent photo-crosslinking, resulting in network formation. The microstructures of the master could be precisely replicated, limiting the shrinkage. Microstructured PTMC was investigated for use in two different applications: as stamping material to transfer a model protein to another surface and as structured substrate for cell culture. Using the flexible and elastic materials as stamps, bovine serum albumin labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate was patterned on glass surfaces.

742,"It is well known that di-block copolymers can spontaneously self-assemble in solvents that are selective for one of the blocks to form a wide range of nanostructures, such as micelles, wormlike micelles or vesicles 1-5. In recent years, particular interest has been given to the self-assembly of block copolymers in aqueous systems, since this may afford new applications in the controlled delivery of drugs 6, 7. To this end amphiphilic block copolymers have been widely studied as building blocks to generate highly ordered self-assembled structures 8-10. Generally, self-organization of amphiphilic copolymers is driven by hydrophobic interactions whereby the selective solvation of the hydrophilic block in aqueous solutions arranges polymer molecules in a manner that most effectively reduces their free energy 11, 12. The dimensions of the resultant assemblies are largely controlled by the molecular weight of the polymer blocks whereas the molar ratio of the blocks has a significant effect on the morphology of the resultant particles 13. Notably, access to non-spherical particle morphologies is also possible by harnessing assembly conditions 14, mid-block interactions 15, electrostatic interactions and crystallization 14, 16, 17. While polymeric micelles are relatively stable in an aqueous environment, they remain equilibrium systems held together by hydrophobic interactions and hence are readily disrupted via changes in conditions such as dilution, ultrasound, heat or pH 18-20. Strategies to increase the stability of polymeric micelles generally rely on chemical crosslinking of either the core or shell to produce robust nanoparticles 21. While this technique …",Jos WH Wennink and Francesca Signori and Marcel Karperien and Jan Feijen and Pieter J Dijkstra,0,,Biodegradable Hydrogels by Physical and Enzymatic Crosslinking of Biomacromolecules,,69,,Aggregation and gelation behavior of stereocomplexed four-arm PLA-PEG copolymers,https://research.utwente.nl/files/6061329/thesis_J_Wennink.pdf#page=78,,2013
743,"Eight-armed poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (L-lactide)-tyramine (PEG-(PLLA-TA) 8) star block copolymers with different PLLA block length were synthesized. It was found that the introduction of tyramine end functional groups influenced the aggregation behavior of the PEG-PLLA star block copolymers in an aqueous environment. Compared to PEG-(PLLA) 8 copolymers PEG-(PLLA-TA) 8 copolymers with a similar PLLA block length had a lower critical association concentration value and formed physically crosslinked hydrogels with a thermo-reversible gel to sol phase transition at lower concentrations. Enzymatic crosslinking of the PEG-(PLLA-TA) 8 star block copolymers with HRP and H2O2 was only possible when the tyramine units were exposed to the aqueous phase. Due to this prerequisite the upper limit of the DP of the PLLA blocks for efficient crosslinking was 4. At higher DP values the tyramine groups are embedded in the hydrophobic core of aggregates and show no reaction in the presence of the enzyme. At a DP of 4 of the PLLA blocks both 5 and 10 wt% solutions of the copolymers could be crosslinked with the formation of viscous hydrogels. Lowering the DP of the PLLA blocks to 3, only afforded hydrogels upon reaction with HRP and H2O2 at relatively high polymer concentrations of 15 and 20 wt%. These elastic hydrogels had storage moduli of 3-4 kPa. At lower concentrations no gels were formed but crosslinking within nanoparticles took place. The chemically crosslinked hydrogels were hydrolytically degraded at pH 7.4 in 1-2 weeks depending on the concentration of the precursor polymer solution and PLLA block length.

744,"Articular cartilage is a highly resilient tissue that exhibits a very limited capacity to repair itself once damaged. Current procedures to restore this tissue, such as debridement, microfracture, mosaicplasty and autologous chondrocyte transfer vary largely in success rate and the average long-term results are unsatisfactory. The current long term outlook for patients is the replacement of the biological joint with an artificial prosthesis. In the past decade, as an alternative approach, research has focused on cartilage tissue engineering. In this approach polymeric materials are generally used for the preparation of scaffolds and combined with chondrocytes to provide a temporary matrix that may regenerate into cartilage. Since cartilage is a highly hydrated soft tissue, hydrogels are regarded suitable temporary scaffold materials for cartilage tissue engineering. Especially in-situ forming hydrogels that can be applied by minimally invasive procedures are widely investigated. The current status of cartilage tissue engineering technology using in-situ forming hydrogels is presented in this review.",Jos WH Wennink and Jan Feijen and Pieter J Dijkstra and Marcel Karperien,0,,Biodegradable Hydrogels by Physical and Enzymatic Crosslinking of Biomacromolecules,,9,,Injectable Hydrogels for Articular Cartilage Tissue Engineering,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11488155.pdf#page=18,,2013
745,"Hyperbranched poly (ethyleneimine)-poly (L-lactide)-poly (ethylene glycol)(α-HPEI-γ-(PLLA-mPEG) 2) copolymers were synthesized by coupling of NHS-(PLLA-mPEG) 2 to the primary amine groups of HPEI with molecular weights (α) of 600, 1200, 1800, 5000 or 10000 g/mol. The maximum conversion of primary amine groups in all cases was 70% yielding hyperbranched copolymers with γ (average number of groups per molecule of HPEI) varying from 3 to 40 with increasing HPEI molecular weight and a PEG content of 75.5 wt%. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurementsshowed that aqueous solutions of 1200-HPEI-5.5-(PLLA-mPEG) 2 and 1800-HPEI-8.2-(PLLA-mPEG) 2 had a distinct bimodal distribution of small aggregates with an average diameter of 35 nm and larger aggregates of~ 1000 nm. Both the low molecular weight 600-HPEI-2.8-(PLLA-mPEG) 2 and high molecular weight 5000-HPEI-19.5-(PLLA-mPEG) 2 and 10000-HPEI-40.3-(PLLA-mPEG) 2 hyperbranched copolymers showed an almost unimodal distribution of small aggregates of 35 nm at low concentrations. All α-HPEI-γ-(PLLA-mPEG) 2 copolymers had a ξ-potential of 0 mV suggesting that the HPEI moiety was shielded by the PLLA-mPEG arms. At high concentrations (≥ 25 wt%) vial tilting and oscillatory rheology measurements showed that 1200-HPEI-5.5-(PLLA-mPEG) 2 and 1800-HPEI-8.2-(PLLA-mPEG) 2 formed hydrogels while all other hyperbranched copolymers afforded solutions.

746,"Starting from bis-MPA, PEG-PLLA triblock copolymers (bis-MPA-(PLLA-PEG) 2), comprising a central N-hydroxy succinimide active ester were synthesized. Reacting the corresponding active ester with α, ω-diamines afforded four-armed (PEG-PLLA) 2-R-(PLLAPEG) 2 copolymers with central α, ω-diamide groups (R). Applying α, ω-diamines like spermine, norspermidine or diethylenenetriamine, triethylenetetramine or tetraethylenepentamine secondary amines were introduced. Whereas a copolymer containing no secondary amine groups showed fully thermo-reversible gelation behavior, copolymers comprising a central moiety containing secondary amine groups form initially gels in PBS but after repeated heating to 75 C and cooling to 20 C retained the ‘sol’state. Dynamic light scattering revealed large differences in the aggregation behavior of the four-armed PEG-PLLA-PEG block copolymers in PBS at different temperatures. A copolymer containing no secondary amine groups showed a thermo-reversible shift in the size of micelles and micellar aggregates (57 and 877 nm at 25 C and 40 and 152 nm at 50 C). Conversely, copolymers comprising a central moiety containing secondary amine groups show a temperature independent distribution mainly consisting of micelles. It is proposed that the protonated amine groups preferably are located at the corona of the micelles and micellar aggregates and/or shielded by the PEG blocks, hindering the formation of hydrogels by PEG entanglements upon a change in temperature.",Jos WH Wennink and Francesca Signori and Marcel Karperien and Jan Feijen and Pieter J Dijkstra,0,,Biodegradable Hydrogels by Physical and Enzymatic Crosslinking of Biomacromolecules,,43,,Aggregation Behavior of Thermo-Responsive and pH-sensitive 4-armed PLLA-PEG copolymers,https://research.utwente.nl/files/6061329/thesis_J_Wennink.pdf#page=52,,2013

750,"The anthracycline antibiotics daunomycin and 14-hydroxydaunomycin (adriamycin) have been shown to be very effective in the treatment of a number of malignancies (1). Besides the non-specific side-effects of cytostatic agents, adriamycin exerts a specific toxic activity on the heart (2). This side effect may eventually lead to al life-threa; ening congestive heart failure when a cumulative dose of 550 mg. m. T has been exceeded. Although the exact mechanism through which toxicity develops has not been elucidated, three major hypotheses on the pathogenesis of adriamycin induced cardiotoxicity have been postulated. As all quinones, adriamycin is a, potent chelating agent for divalent cations, in particular for Ca"" which is involved in the excitation-contraction coupling of muscle cells (3). Adriamycin can be converted to a semi-quinone either by microsomal or by mitochondrial metabolic pathways. These semiquinones give rise to the formation of free radicals, which may lead to peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid structures (4). Finally, adria–mycin is a strong intercalating agent, which causes an inhibition of RNA, DNA protein synthesis.

We previously showed that excessive mechanical stress induced chondrocytes apoptosis via p53 and p53AIP1 pathway. In this study, we evaluated p53R2 expression and function of chondrocytes in response to mechanical stress. Methods: OA cartilage samples were obtained from total knee replacement surgery, and normal cartilage samples were from femoral neck fracture.

Hydrogels are water swollen networks of crosslinked hydrophilic polymers. Their high water content renders them highly biocompatible and also leads to minimal adsorption of proteins. The mechanical properties of hydrogels parallel those of soft tissues, making them particularly interesting for tissue engineering. Hydro gels may beformed in situ, thus allowing easy mixing of cells and bioactive molecules, such as proteins, with the polymer solutions prior to gelation.""

797,"Vascular endothelial cells have an extensive response to physiological levels of shear stress. There is evidence that the protein caveolin-1 is involved in the early phase of this response. In this study, caveolin-1 was downregulated in human endothelial cells by RNAi. When these cells were subjected to a shear stress of 15 dyn/cm2 for 10 minutes, activation of Akt and ERK1/2 was significantly lower than in control cells. Moreover, activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in response to vascular endothelial growth factor was significantly lower in cells with low levels of caveolin-1. However, activation of integrin-mediated signaling during cell adhesion onto fibronectin was not hampered by lowered caveolin-1 levels. In conclusion, caveolin-1 is an essential component in the response of endothelial cells to shear stress. Furthermore, the results suggest that the role of caveolin-1 in this process lies in facilitating efficient VEGFR2 …",Andries Dirk van der Meer and Marloes Kamphuis and Andreas A Poot and Jan Feijen and I Vermes,0,,Journal of cell biology,532432,,Rockefeller University Press,Lowering caveolin-1 expression in human vascular cells inhibits signal transduction in response to shear stress,https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/lowering-caveolin-1-expression-in-human-vascular-cells-inhibits-s,,2009

802,"A preliminary implantation study was carried out using porous tubular PTMC scaffolds, either unseeded or seeded with human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as partial replacement of the rat abdominal aorta. The study showed that due to a mismatch in wall thickness of the tubular PTMC scaffolds and the rat abdominal aorta, end-to-end suturing was problematic. Therefore, two poly (propylene) connectors were used to connect a scaffold to the aorta. Unseeded scaffolds showed extensive leakage of blood upon implantation. However, MSC-seeded scaffolds showed minor leakage which stopped a few minutes after restoration of blood flow. The grafts remained patent until the end of the experiment, 4 h after implantation. It is concluded that for long-term experiments, another suturing technique has to be used. To prevent blood loss, the PTMC scaffolds have to be seeded with cells.",AA Poot and J Feijen and DW Grijpma,0,,POLY (TRIMETHYLENE CARBONATE) SCAFFOLDS FOR VASCULAR TISSUE ENGINEERING,,141,University of Twente,"Y.

804,"Tubular scaffolds (internal diameter approximately 3 mm and wall thickness approximately 0.8 mm) with a porosity of approximately 83% and an average pore size of 116 μm were prepared from flexible poly (trimethylene carbonate)(PTMC) polymer by dip-coating and particulate leaching methods. PTMC is a flexible and biocompatible polymer that crosslinks upon irradiation; porous network structures were obtained by irradiating the specimens in vacuum at 25 kGy before leaching soluble salt particles. To assess the suitability of these scaffolds in dynamic cell culturing for cardiovascular tissue engineering, the scaffolds were coated with a thin (0.1 to 0.2 mm) non-porous PTMC layer and its performance was evaluated in a closed pulsatile flow system (PFS). For this, the PFS was operated at physiological conditions at liquid flows of 1.56 ml/s with pressures varying from 80-120 mmHg at a frequency of 70 pulsations per minute.The mechanical properties of these coated porous PTMC scaffolds were not significantly different than non-coated scaffolds. Typical tensile strengths in the radial direction were 0.15 MPa, initial stiffness values were close to 1.4 MPa. Their creep resistance in cyclic deformation experiments was excellent. In the pulsatile flow setup, the distention rates of these flexible and elastic scaffolds were approximately 0.10% per mmHg, which is comparable to that of a porcine carotid artery (0.11% per mmHg). The compliance and stiffness index values were close to those of natural arteries.",Y Song and JWH Wennink and AA Poot and I Vermes and J Feijen and DW Grijpma,0,,POLY (TRIMETHYLENE CARBONATE) SCAFFOLDS FOR VASCULAR TISSUE ENGINEERING,,73,University of Twente,4| Evaluation of PTMC tubular scaffolds,https://research.utwente.nl/files/6083328/thesis_Y_Song.pdf#page=79,,2009

PTMC was synthesized and porous tubular structures were prepared by dipping coating, cross-linking by g-irradiation, and leaching. SMCs were seeded into the porous structures by perfusion and then the constructs were cultured in a pulsatile bioreactor system.

849,"Two different hyperbranched poly (amidoamine) s (PAAs) were prepared by hydrogen-transfer polyaddition of N, N′-bisacryloylcystamine (CBA) with ethylenediamine (EDA) and of N, N′-bisacryloylpiperazine (BAP) with cystamine. Remarkable results were obtained in the DNA complexation tests, including particle size and zeta-potential measurement. Since the cationic structure of these polymers should permit an easier penetration of DNA through the cell membrane and the presence of the disulfide linkages should ensure a reductive degradation of the polymer main chain inside cells, these polymers can be regarded as promising vectors for an efficient gene delivery.",F Martello and J Feijen and Johannes FJ Engbersen and WE Hennink and AP Sam and P Ferruti,0,,,,,,Hyperbranched poly (amido amine) s for gene delivery to ovarian cancer cells,https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/hyperbranched-polyamido-amines-for-gene-delivery-to-ovarian-cance,,2008

854,"The mechanical behavior of single collagen fibrils was studied using a slightly adapted AFM system. Single collagen fibrils were attached between an AFM cantilever and a glass surface to perform tensile tests at different strain rates and stress relaxation measurements. The Young’s modulus of collagen fibrils immersed in PBS buffer increased with 30% by increasing the strain rate from 0.1 to 10 μm/s, indicating that the stress-strain behavior of individual collagen fibrils is rate-dependent. Stress relaxation of the fibrils subjected to 5-7% strain for 5-10 min was also measured. The stress relaxation process of individual collagen fibrils could be described by a two-term Prony series. For native individual collagen fibrils in PBS buffer, a fast (τ1= 1.8±0.4 s) and a slow (τ2= 60±10 s) relaxation process was found. After cross-linking the fibrils with EDC/NHS, τ2 increased to 225±10 s while τ1 remained unchanged. After cross-linking of fibrils with glutaraldehyde, τ1 and τ2 increased to 3.7±1.0 and 250±80 s, respectively. Based on these results, we propose that sliding of microfibrils with respect to each other correlates with the fast relaxation process whereas sliding of collagen molecules with respect to each other is related to the slower part of the stress relaxation.",Lanti Yang and Kees O van der Werf and Martin L Bennink and Pieter J Dijkstra and Jan Feijen,0,,MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF COLLAGEN FIBRILS AND ELASTIC FIBERS EXPLORED BY AFM,,99,,Viscoelastic Behavior of Collagen Type I Fibrils: Evidence for the Existence of Microfibrils?,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.995.9341&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=105,,2008
855,"The aim of the study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in apoptosis of human promyelocytic cells (HL60) induced by hyperthermia and to compare this to radiationinduced apoptosis as a reference model.Apoptosis of HL60 cells was induced by heat-treatment (43 C during 1h) or by X-radiation (8 Gy) and followed at increasing time periods after treatment with Annexin V binding to phosphatidylserine (PS). The transition of the mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ ψm) was estimated by the extent of mitochondrial JC-1 uptake.

856,"Poly(D,L-lactide) is a degradable polymer with a long history of use in medical applications. It is strong and stiff and degrades over the course of months into lactic acid, a body-own substance. In the field of tissue engineering it is commonly used to fabricate scaffolds. Stereolithography is a high resolution rapid prototyping technique by which designed 3D objects can be built using photo-initiated radical polymerisations. Poly(D,Llactide) (PDLLA) networks can be obtained by photopolymerisation of oligomers functionalised with unsaturated groups. In this work, PDLLA oligomers of varying architectures (arm lengths, numbers of arms) were synthesised and end-functionalised with methacrylate groups. These macromers were photo-crosslinked in solution to yield PDLLA networks of different architectures. The influence of the network architecture on its physical properties was studied.",Ferry PW Melchels and Dirk W Grijpma and Jan Feijen,0,,,,,,"Properties of photo-cured poly (D, L-lactide) networks",https://eprints.qut.edu.au/38983/,,2008
857,"Micromechanical properties of single elastic fibers and fibrillin-microfibrils, isolated from equine ligamentum nuchae using chemical and enzymatic methods were determined with atomic force microscopy (AFM). Young’s moduli of single elastic fibers immersed in water, devoid of or containing fibrillin-microfibrils, were determined using bending tests. Bending freely suspended elastic fibers on a micro-channeled substrate by a tip-less AFM cantilever generated a force versus displacement curve from which the Young’s modulus was calculated. For single elastic fibers, Young’s moduli in the range of 0.3-1.5 MPa were determined, values not significantly affected by the absence or presence of fibrillinmicrofibrils. To further understand the role of fibrillin-microfibrils in vertebrate elastic fibers, layers of fibrillin-microfibrils were subjected to nano-indentation tests.

886,"Segmented block copolymers based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) flexible segments and monodisperse crystallizable bisester tetra-amide segments were made via a polycondensation reaction. The molecular weight of the PEO segments varied from 600 to 4600 g/mol and a bisester tetra-amide segment (T6T6T) based on dimethyl terephthalate (T) and hexamethylenediamine (6) was used. The resulting copolymers were melt-processable and transparent. The crystallinity of the copolymers was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR). The thermal properties were studied by DSC, temperature modulated synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The elastic properties were evaluated by compression set (CS) test. The crystallinity of the T6T6T segments in the copolymers was high (>84%) and the crystallization fast due to the use of monodisperse tetra-amide segments. DMA experiments showed that the materials had a low Tg, a broad and almost temperature independent rubbery plateau and a sharp flow temperature. With increasing PEO length both the PEO melting temperature and the PEO crystallinity increased. When the PEO segment length was longer than 2000 g/mol the PEO melting temperature was above room temperature and this resulted in a higher modulus and in higher compression set values at room temperature. The properties of PEO-T6T6T copolymers were compared with similar poly(propylene oxide) and poly(tetramethylene oxide) copolymers. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

888,"Introduction: For tissue engineering of small-diameter blood vessels, biodegradable, flexible and elastic porous tubular structures are most suited. The applicability of poly (trimethylene carbonate)(PTMC), random copolymers of TMC and e-caprolactone poly (TMC-CL), and networks based on these polymers as scaffolding materials was investigated.Methods: TMC-based (co) polymers were synthesized by ringopening polymerization. Tubular structures were prepared by dipping glass mandrels in polymer solutions containing dispersed, sieved sugar particles, followed by g-irradiation and cross-linking, and leaching. For mechanical-and biocompatibility tests, films of different thicknesses were prepared by compression molding, solvent casting, and spin-coating.Results and Discussion: PTMC and poly (TMC-CL) are flexible materials, with E-modulus values below 10 MPa and elongations at break higher than 500 …",Y Song and HH Weekamp and Marloes Kamphuis and Zheng Zhang and I Vermes and Andreas A Poot and Dirk W Grijpma and Jan Feijen,0,,Tissue engineering,7,1745-1745,Mary Ann Liebert Inc.,Porous tubular scaffolds based on flexible and elastic TMC (co) polymers,https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/porous-tubular-scaffolds-based-on-flexible-and-elastic-tmc-copoly-2,13,2007
889,"The use of porous structures as tissue engineering scaffolds imposes high demands on the pore architecture. Stereolithography is a rapid prototyping method based on photo-polymerisation, that can be utilised to make 3D constructs with high spatial control. In this study, biodegradable resins were developed that can find application in stereolithography. Poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLLA) oligomers were synthesised and functionalised with methacrylate end-groups. By mixing the resulting macromers with a diluent, photo-initiator and inhibitor, lowviscosity resins were obtained that were photocrosslinked to yield stiff and strong degradable poly(lactide) networks. Also, porous scaffolds were fabricated on a stereolithography apparatus (SLA) from a nondegradable resin.",FPW Melchels and Dirk W Grijpma and Jan Feijen,0,,,,,,Development of a PDLLA-based stereolithography resin for making tissue engineering scaffolds,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/38980/,,2007

933,"Adherent cells are dependent for survival from continuous engagement of cellular integrins to the extra cellular matrix. Detachment of adherent cells from the matrix induces almost immediately apoptosis, a phenomenon designated as ‘anoikis’ or homelessness (1). Activation of death receptors in adherent cells will cause detachment of those cells from their support inducing anoikis. Anoikis is of pertinent relevance to tissue homeostasis (2). Annexin V binding is extensively used to analyse apoptosis. During apoptosis (or necrosis) phosphatidyl serine is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and is recognised by Annexin V binding (3). We developed a new very sensitive method to analyse anoikis in adherent cell cultures using the principles of the Dissociation Enhanced Lanthanide Fluoro Immuno Assay (DELFIA®, Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland)(4). By using Europium-labelled Annexin V, the occurrence of apoptosis was measured in three different cell fractions derived from adherent cell cultures. The occurrence of apoptosis was analysed in cells which were still attached to the culture surface, anoikis was measured in detached cells (floating cells) and the final stage of the apoptotic pathway was investigated by analysing apoptotic bodies.",J FEIJEN and I VERMES,0,,Ned Tijdschr Klin Chem Labgeneesk,4,292-293,,A novel time resolved fluorometric assay of anoikis using Europium-labelled Annexin V in cultured adherent cells,http://www.academia.edu/download/48020391/A_novel_time_resolved_fluorometric_assay20160813-20050-1iqo10p.pdf,30,2005
934,"After preparation of a porous biocompatible and biodegradable scaffold and isolation of the desired cell type, cell seeding is the next critical step in the process to produce an adequate tissue-engineered (TE) construct. Cell seeding plays an important role in determining the initial cell number and initial cell distribution in the TE scaffolds. A high number of initially seeded cells and a uniform cell distribution can improve the structural stability and biochemical composition of the engineered tissues. In this study, several cell seeding procedures were used to improve the spatial smooth muscle cell (SMC) distribution in scaffolds composed of collagen and elastin. Whereas with conventional static seeding, multiple static seeding or injection seeding a multi layer of SMCs on top of the scaffolds is obtained, the use of the described dynamic depth filtration seeding procedure results in the formation of a homogeneous structure of collagen and elastin fibres interspersed with SMCs. These porous constructs have elastic properties, appropriate mechanical strength, and a homogeneous distribution of cells, which makes them suitable for dynamic culturing mimicking in vivo conditions of human small-and medium-sized arteries.",P Engbers-Buijtenhuijs and L Buttafoco and AA Poot and RH Geelkerken and RAI de Vos and LMT Sterk and J Feijen and I Vermes,0,,Biological Characterisation of Tissue-Engineered Vascular Grafts,,65,,Spatial Cell Distribution after Filtration Seeding of Smooth Muscle Cells in Porous Scaffolds for Vascular Tissue Engineering,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.855.192&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=65,,2005
935,"A pulsatile flow bioreactor for tissue engineering of small-diameter blood vessels was developed. The bioreactor consists of four vessels mounted in four parallel chambers. Culture medium can be perfused through the vessels inside the chambers using a peristaltic pump. The closed-circuit system was pressurised to 100 mmHg. This set up allows pulsatile flow (120 beats/min) and fluctuation of pressure inside the vessels between approximately 80 and 120 mmHg, simulating physiological conditions. Two types of vessels were used to further characterise the system. Vessels were either made of non-porous silicone rubber or of porous collagen/elastin crosslinked with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N’-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). The latter scaffolds were seeded with smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and cultured in the bioreactor up to 14 d. The flow rate in the vessels increased linearly with the number of beats/min. At an average flow rate of 9.6 mL/min, an average wall shear rate of 61 s-1 was reached, comparable to the lower wall shear rates in the human carotid artery (60-775 s-1). Increasing the flow rate from 3 to 9.6 mL/min leads to an increase of Reynolds numbers from 29 to 96, which is also in the same range as found for the carotid artery. Pressures were monitored proximal and distal to the vessels and outside the vessels in the chambers. After 1 d of culture of SMCs on crosslinked collagen/elastin scaffolds in the bioreactor, no significant differences were measured between the average pressures over the wall and along the length of the tube. After 14 d of culture, the average pressure inside the vessel was 14 …",L Buttafoco and P Engbers-Buijtenhuijs and AA Poot and PJ Dijkstra and I Vermes and J Feijen,0,,Biological Characterisation of Tissue-Engineered Vascular Grafts,,131,,Development of a bioreactor for tissue engineering of small-diameter blood vessels: design of a pulsatile flow system,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.855.192&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=131,,2005
936,"Tissue homeostasis, the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis, is an important factor in tissue engineering. We describe a new method to analyse markers of both proliferation and apoptosis in one single assay to follow growth behaviour of cell cultures. A pure culture of human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was used in this study. SMCs were either cultured on gelatin coated tissue culture polystyrene (g-TCPS) or in threedimensional porous scaffolds composed of collagen and elastin. mRNA concentrations of cyclin E and tissue transglutaminase (tTG), quantified by a real-time reversed transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and normalised to porphobilinogen deaminase mRNA concentrations, were analysed. tTG mRNA expression levels were increased when cells were cultured in serum-free culture medium compared to standard (serum-containing) culture medium on g-TCPS. Cyclin E mRNA expression levels are not significantly altered in these cell cultures. From these results we concluded that our assay could be used to characterise cell growth behaviour of SMCs in vitro. In addition we showed that this test is suitable to measure the balance between proliferation and apoptosis of SMCs present in tissue-engineered constructs. Crosslinking procedures of three-dimensional porous scaffolds composed of collagen and elastin employing carbodiimide and/or diamine reagents did not influence growth behaviour of SMCs inside the scaffolds.",P Engbers-Buijtenhuijs and L Buttafoco and AA Poot and RH Geelkerken and J Feijen and I Vermes,0,,Biological Characterisation of Tissue-Engineered Vascular Grafts,,81,,Analysis of the Balance Between Proliferation and Apoptosis of Cultured Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells for Tissue,https://research.utwente.nl/files/6071596/thesis_Engbers.pdf#page=81,,2005
