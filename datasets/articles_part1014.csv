1014001,"In this chapter we consider the continuous-time analogs of discrete-time Markov chains. As in the case of their discrete-time analogs, they are characterized by the Markovian property that, given the present state, the future is independent of the past.In Section 5.2 we define continuous-time Markov chains and relate them to the discrete-time Markov chains of Chapter 4. In Section 5 3 we introduce an important class of continuous-time Markov chains known as birth and death processes. These processes can be used to model popUlations whose size changes at any time by a single unit. In Section 5 4 we derive two sets of differential equations-the forward and backward equation-that describe the probability laws for the system. The material in Section 5 5 is concerned with determining the limiting (or long-run) probabilities connected with a continuous-time Markov chain. In Section 5.6 we consider the topic of time reversibility. Among other things, we show that all birth and death processes are time reversible, and then illustrate the importance of this observation to queueing systems. Applications of time reversibility to stochastic population models are also presented in this section In Section 5.7 we illustrate the importance of the reversed chain, even when the process is not time reversible, by using it to study queueing network models, to derive the Erlang loss formula, and to analyze the shared processor system In Section 5.8 we show how to"" uniformize"" Markov chains-a technique useful for numerical computations",Sheldon M Ross and John J Kelly and Roger J Sullivan and William James Perry and Donald Mercer and Ruth M Davis and Thomas Dell Washburn and Earl V Sager and Joseph B Boyce and Vincent L Bristow,8953,10800719657673781291,,,,Wiley,Stochastic processes,https://www.academia.edu/download/56739884/stochastic-processes-ross_2.pdf,2,1996,/scholar?cites=10800719657673781291,B6H9ZbMAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC

1014002,"W hen Jerry Lieberman and I started working on the first edition of this book 45 years ago, our goal was to develop a pathbreaking textbook that would help establish the future direction of education in what was then the emerging field of operations research. Following publication, it was unclear how well this particular goal was met, but what did become clear was that the demand for the book was far larger than either of us had anticipated. Neither of us could have imagined that this extensive worldwide demand would continue at such a high level for such an extended period of time. The enthusiastic response to our first eight editions has been most gratifying. It was a particular pleasure to have the field’s leading professional society, the International Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS), award the 6th edition honorable mention for the 1995 INFORMS Lanchester Prize (the prize awarded for the year’s most outstanding English-language publication of any kind in the field of operations research).",Frederick S Hillier,7311,4885272939583340474,,,,Tata McGraw-Hill Education,Introduction to operations research,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4885272939583340474&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,2012,/scholar?cites=4885272939583340474,B6H9ZbMAAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC

1014003,""" A clarity of style and a conciseness of treatment which students will find most welcome. The material is valuable and well organized… an excellent introduction to applied probability.""—Journal of the American Statistical Association. This book offers a concise introduction to some of the stochastic processes that frequently arise in applied probability. Emphasis is on optimization models and methods, particularly in the area of decision processes. After reviewing some basic notions of probability theory and stochastic processes, the author presents a useful treatment of the Poisson process, including compound and nonhomogeneous Poisson processes. Subsequent chapters deal with such topics as renewal theory and Markov chains; semi-Markov, Markov renewal, and regenerative processes; inventory theory; and Brownian motion and continuous time optimization models. Each chapter is followed by a section of useful problems that illustrate and complement the text. There is also a short list of relevant references at the end of every chapter. Students will find this a largely self-contained text that requires little previous knowledge of the subject. It is especially suited for a one-year course in applied probability at the advanced undergraduate or beginning postgraduate level. 1970 edition.",Sheldon M Ross,3084,5708962789882407503,,,,Courier Corporation,Applied probability models with optimization applications,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Ld3CAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:Tyrd9mhPOk8J:scholar.google.com&ots=mRh0CAO_zO&sig=OPL0fmaAMXXuQseZiPiSiO9XoSI,,2013,/scholar?cites=5708962789882407503,B6H9ZbMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C

1014005,"Introduction to Stochastic Dynamic Programming presents the basic theory and examines the scope of applications of stochastic dynamic programming. The book begins with a chapter on various finite-stage models, illustrating the wide range of applications of stochastic dynamic programming. Subsequent chapters study infinite-stage models: discounting future returns, minimizing nonnegative costs, maximizing nonnegative returns, and maximizing the long-run average return. Each of these chapters first considers whether an optimal policy need exist—providing counterexamples where appropriate—and then presents methods for obtaining such policies when they do. In addition, general areas of application are presented. The final two chapters are concerned with more specialized models. These include stochastic scheduling models and a type of process known as a multiproject bandit. The mathematical prerequisites for this text are relatively few. No prior knowledge of dynamic programming is assumed and only a moderate familiarity with probability—including the use of conditional expectation—is necessary.",Sheldon M Ross,1820,11737955128165253084,,,,Academic press,Introduction to stochastic dynamic programming,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11737955128165253084&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,2014,/scholar?cites=11737955128165253084,B6H9ZbMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC

The text's main merits are the clarity of presentation, contemporary examples and applications from diverse areas, an explanation of intuition, and the ideas behind the statistical methods. Concepts are motivated, illustrated, and explained in a way that attempts to increase one's intuition.

This book is a compact account of the basic features of probability and random processes at the level of first and second year mathematics undergraduates and Masters' students in cognate fields. It is suitable for a first course in probability, plus a follow-up course in random processes including Markov chains. A special feature is the authors' attention to rigorous mathematics: not everything is rigorous, but the need for rigour is explained at difficult junctures. The text is enriched by simple exercises, together with problems (with very brief hints) many of which are taken from final examinations at Cambridge and Oxford. The first eight chapters form a course in basic probability, being an account of events, random variables, and distributions-discrete and continuous random variables are treated separately-together with simple versions of the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. There is an account of moment generating functions and their applications. The following three chapters are about branching processes, random walks, and continuous-time random processes such as the Poisson process.

In this paper, we consider the case when no a priori information about Z is known except that is distributed in [0,1]. We describe an approximation algorithm ${\cal A}{\cal A}$ which, given $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, when running independent experiments with respect to any Z, produces an estimate that is within a factor $1+\epsilon$ of $\mu$ with probability at least $1-\delta$.

1014029,"               One of the major difficulties in attempting to apply known queueing theory results to real problems is that almost always these results assume a time-stationary Poisson arrival process, whereas in practice the actual process is almost invariably non-stationary. In this paper we consider single-server infinite-capacity queueing models in which the arrival process is a non-stationary process with an intensity function Λ(t), t ≧ 0, which is itself a random process. We suppose that the average value of the intensity function exists and is equal to some constant, call it λ, with probability 1. We make a conjecture to the effect that 'the closer {Λ(t), t≧ 0$ is to the stationary Poisson process with rate λ' then the smaller is the average customer delay, and then we verify the conjecture in the special case where the arrival process is an interrupted Poisson process.

1014051,"When a new computer software package is developed, a testing procedure is often put into effect to eliminate the faults, or bugs, in the package. One common procedure is to try the package on a set of well-known problems to try to see if any errors result. This goes for some fixed time with all detected errors being noted. Then the testing stops and the package is carefully checked to determine the specific bugs that were responsible for the observed errors, and the package is then altered to remove these bugs.

1014054,"The game of pure strategy, sometimes called Goofspiel or Gops is played by two players, using a normal deck of cards, as follows. The 13 clubs are first taken out of the deck and of the remaining 39 cards the 13 hearts are given to Player I, the 13 diamonds to Player II, and the 13 spades are placed face down in the center. The spades are shuffled and one is turned face up. At this point, the two players choose one of their cards and then simultaneously discard it. The one who discards the higher card (ace being low, king high) wins from the other an amount equal to the value of the upturned spade (ace= 1, king= 13). If both players discard the same card, then neither wins. The three cards are then thrown away, a new spade upturned and the game continues.

Upon arrival, the customer presents itself to a gatekeeper who has to decide whether to admit the customer into the system without knowing the busy-idle status of the server. There is a cost if the gatekeeper blocks a customer, and a larger cost if an admitted customer finds the server busy and therefore has to leave the system. The goal of the gatekeeper is to minimize the total expected discounted cost on an infinite time horizon. In the case of an exponential service distribution, we show that a threshold-type policy-block for a time period following each admission and then admit the next customer-is optimal.

1014121,"Our major objective is to obtain an approximation for the average time spent waiting in queue by a customer in an M/G/k queueing system--call it W sub Q. This is done by means of an approximation assumption presented, which is shown to be asymptotically valid both in heavy and in light traffic. The approximation assumption is used to derive an approximation for W sub Q. Numerical comparison with tables given by Hillier-Lo in the special case of Erlang service times indicate that the approximation, which depends on the service distribution only through its first two moments, works remarkably well. In addition, as a by-product of our analysis, we also obtain approximations for the distribution of the number of busy servers and the mean length and number of customers in a busy period. These latter approximations depend on the service distribution only through its mean. The approximation assumption is valid and leads to the exact result in the case of a limited capacity system where no queue is allowed to form.Descriptors:* QUEUEING THEORY, APPROXIMATION (MATHEMATICS), POISSON DENSITY FUNCTIONS, PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS, RANDOM VARIABLESSubject Categories: Operations ResearchDistribution Statement: APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEDEFENSE TECHNICAL INFORMATION CENTER8725 John J.

The question for the analyst is how to say something about the system reliability when the correct joint distributions are unknown.In this situation, the analyst may use the marginal component reliabilities and assume independence among the components in order to estimate the system reliability.

For example, a teller at a bank or a checker at a check-out counter in a supermarket may change the service rate depending on the number of customers present in the system. But the service rate as a function of the number in the system can rarely be measured. Consequently, in a typical model of such a system it is assumed that the service rate is constant. Hence, such systems with a single stage are often modeled by GI/GI/c queueing systems with mutually independent arrival and service processes. Then the observed service times are used to find a sample distribution that will represent the distribution of the assumed i.i.d. service times.

1014129,"1. Introduction. The following model is considered by Starr (1972): at most n tosses of a coin, having a constant probability p of coming up heads, are made. After each toss we have the option of either stopping and receiving an amount equal to the length of the terminal run of heads (that is if we were on a streak of k heads in the last k tosses then we could stop and receive k), or of paying an amount c and tossing the coin again. When n tosses have already been made we must stop.The purpose of this note is to point out that with a simple modification the above problem fits the framework in which a one-stage look ahead policy is optimal. This yields not only an easy solution to the problem but also provides much insight. For instance, the reason for the additivity of the optimal contin-uation boundary, which is commented on by Starr on page 1890 (1972), now becomes clear.

1014143,"A method is presented to couple and solve the optimal control and the optimal estimation problems simultaneously, allowing systems with bearing-only sensors to maneuver to obtain observability for relative navigation without unnecessarily detracting from a primary mission. A fundamentally new approach to trajectory optimization and the dual control problem is developed, constraining polynomial approximations of the Fisher Information Matrix to provide an information gradient and allow prescription of the level of future estimation certainty required for mission accomplishment. Disturbances, modeling deficiencies, and corrupted measurements are addressed with recursive updating of the target estimate with an Unscented Kalman Filter and the optimal path with Radau pseudospectral collocation methods and sequential quadratic programming. The basic real-time optimal control (RTOC) structure is investigated, specifically addressing limitations of current techniques in this area that lose error integration. The resulting guidance method can be applied to any bearing-only system, such as submarines using passive sonar, anti-radiation missiles, or small UAVs seeking to land on power lines for energy harvesting. Methods and tools required for implementation are developed, including variable calculation timing and tip-tail blending for potential discontinuities.

In particular a fundamental inequality is obtained for EphiX sub 1,..., X sub n when phi is binary which can, among other things, be used to generate a host of inequalities concerning IFRA distributions including, as a special case, the IFRA convolution theorem. In Section 2 we define the concept of an IFRA stochastic process and prove the analog of the IFRA closure theorem and in Section 3 we do the same for NBU stochastic processes.Descriptors:",Sheldon M Ross,5,8790840020883303672,,,,CALIFORNIA UNIV BERKELEY OPERATIONS RESEARCH CENTER,Multi-Valued State Component Reliability Systems.,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA042840,,1977,/scholar?cites=8790840020883303672,B6H9ZbMAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C

1014160,"One of the major difficulties in attempting to apply known queueing theory results to real problems is that almost always these results assume a time stationary Poisson arrival process, whereas in practice the actual process is almost invariably nonstationary. This paper considers single server infinite capacity queueing models in which the arrival process is a nonstationary process with an intensity function Lambdat, t or 0, which is itself a random process. The average value of the intensity function exists and is equal to some constant, called lambda, qith probability 1. If the effect that the closer Lambdat, t or 0 is to the stationary Poisson process with rate Lambda then the smaller is the average customer delay, and then the conjecture is verified in a special case.Descriptors:",Sheldon M Ross,5,17978800016043041823,,,,CALIFORNIA UNIV BERKELEY OPERATIONS RESEARCH CENTER,Average Delay in Queues with Nonstationary Poisson Arrivals.,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA041629,,1977,/scholar?cites=17978800016043041823,B6H9ZbMAAAAJ:3NQIlFlcGxIC

Mean waiting times predicted by the M/G/1 model differed significantly from observed times. Analysis of possible causes of failure of this model suggested a limited queue length M/G/1 model for one chamber, from which more accurate predictions were derived.

1014219,"A common model for the changes over time of the price (or sometimes the logarithm of the price) of a commodity is the random walk model. This is a Markov model which supposes that the change in price in any time period is a random variable, independent of the past, and having a given distribution F. In this note, we propose a generalized model in which the distribution of price change at any time depends upon the (environmental state'at that time. That is, we suppose that if sub Sn and sub Yn represent the price and the environmental state at time in n then, given sub Yn= i, sub Sn+ 1-Sn is a random variable with distribution Fi. We also suppose that the environmental state changes in a Markovian fashion. An application of this model to a stock option example is presented.(Author)Descriptors:* Monte Carlo method,* Operations research, Random variables, Costs, Probability, Markov processes, EnvironmentsSubject Categories: Operations ResearchDistribution Statement: APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEDEFENSE TECHNICAL INFORMATION CENTER8725 John J.

1014223,"The paper considers the problem of maximizing the long-run average return in a single server queueing reward system in which the customer's offer of a joint distribution of reward and service time required to earn this reward is independent of the renewal process which governs customer arrivals. After the problem is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process, the form of an optimal policy is characterized. When the renewal process is Poisson, the characterization is easily stated: accept a customer if and only if the ratio of his expected reward to his expected service time is larger than g, the long-run average return. When the arrival process is Poisson, g is easily found. Next, batch arrivals are permitted, and further results are obtained.Descriptors:* QUEUEING THEORY,* DECISION THEORY, OPTIMIZATION, DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS, STOCHASTIC PROCESSESSubject Categories: Operations ResearchDistribution Statement: APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEDEFENSE TECHNICAL INFORMATION CENTER8725 John J.

1014241,The normalized importance sampling estimator allows the target density f to be known only up to a multiplicative constant. We indicate how it can be derived by a delta method based approximation of a Rao-Blackwellized acceptance rejection estimator. Using additional terms in the delta method then results on a new estimator that also only requires f to be known only up to a multiplicative constant. Numerical examples indicate that the new estimator usually outperforms the normalized importance sampling estimator in terms of mean square error.,Samim Ghamami and Sheldon M Ross,0,,,,,,Improving the normalized importance sampling estimator,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3fp8j1p8,,2012,,B6H9ZbMAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC

The resulting clusters are then randomly permuted, with the process continuing until only a single cluster remains.

The decision maker's objective is to successively choose actions so as to maximize his expected reward earned over an infinite time span. It follows from known results that the decision maker's choice need only depend upon the outcome of a randomization that depends on the model only through the state of the model and the time when the choice is made. It is shown by counterexample that this is basically the smallest class of decision rules that need be considered. Conditions under which a stationary policy is optimal are also presented. The second part of the report discusses the same model under a new criteria, namely, the average cost incurred per unit time.

1014300,"The theory of cumulative processes, introduced and developed by WL Smith, provides a significant generalization of the renewal counting process. One examines the question of extending the Blackwell and key renewal theorems to cumulative processes. For a subclass of cumulative processes, which one calls strongly cumulative, the Blackwell and key renewal theorems hold under very general conditions. This class of cumulative processes includes all the standard examples of cumulative processes. One also studies processes of the form Yt the integral from o to t Vsds where V is a regenerative process. Smith has shown that under mild conditions Vs converges in distribution, say to Vinfinity, as s approaches infinity, and that Ytt converges almost surely and in expectation to Kappa sub 1mu sub 1 a constant. The result is that Kappa sub 1mu sub 1 EVinfinity. This holds even if lim as t approaches infinity, of EVt does not exist.Descriptors:",Sheldon M Ross and Mark Brown,0,,,,,CALIFORNIA UNIV BERKELEY OPERATIONS RESEARCH CENTER,ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF CUMULATIVE PROCESSES,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD0713391,,1970,,B6H9ZbMAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC

1014301,"Suppose there are n men available to perform n jobs. The n jobs occur in sequential order with the value of each job being a random variable X. Associated with each man is a probability p. If ap man is assigned to an X= x job, the (expected) reward is assumed to be given by px. After a man is assigned to a job, he is unavailable for future assignments. The paper is concerned with the optimal assignment of the n men to the n jobs so as to maximize the total expected reward. The optimal policy is characterized, and a recursive equation is presented for obtaining the necessary constants of this optimal policy. In particular, if p1 or= p2 or=... or= pn the optimal choice in the initial stage of an n stage assignment problem is to use pi if x falls into an ith non-overlapping interval comprising the real line. These intervals depend on n and the CDF of X, but are independent of the p's. The optimal policy is also presented for the generalized assignment problem, ie, the assignment problem where the (expected) reward if a'p'man is assigned to an x job is given by a function r (p, x).Descriptors:* SEQUENCES (MATHEMATICS), MATRICES (MATHEMATICS), OPTIMIZATION, PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, PROBABILITY, RANDOM VARIABLES, SCHEDULING, STOCHASTIC PROCESSESSubject Categories: Operations ResearchDistribution Statement: APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEDEFENSE TECHNICAL INFORMATION CENTER8725 John J.

1014320,"OK, let’s get two things straight before I review this book: First of all, I am not probability theory’s biggest fan. Don’t get me wrong—I was originally trained as chemist, so I certainly recognize its enormous importance in the natural and social sciences. Random variables and probability distributions have become all the rage in financial engineering and mathematical finance as well. We all know someone that before their 27th birthday was offered a six-figure salary by some humongous corporation to play with stochastic functions in some nebulous way and make them a few more million while telling them whom to fire at the bottom.Yes,“quants” and financial mathematicians are now very sexy on Wall Street and its brethren boulevards; they have bright futures indeed. These disciplines have traditionally required sophisticated mathematical training in measure theory, harmonic analysis and stochastic processes, skills far better suited to physicists and mathematicians than to “suits” who wouldn’t know—or care to know—Brownian motion from a bag of brownies from Dunkin’Donuts.",Sheldon M Ross and Erol A Peköz,0,,,,,,MAA Reviews,http://people.bu.edu/pekoz/maareview.pdf,,,,B6H9ZbMAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C

1014321,"An investment project is a vector a=(a0, a1,., a,,) of payments over time, where a payment is made to or by the investor according to whether a,-is positive or negative. It is assumed that the investor can initiate investment a at any desired non-negative level at any period. An investment permits arbitrage if it is possible by investing suitably, without ever introducing money from the outside, to have a positive amount of money after a finite number of periods at which all investment projects have been completed. Simple sufficient conditions, in terms of linear functions on the elements of a, are provided for a given investment to permit arbitrage. The provided conditions are ‘constructive’in the sense that they provide the investor with guidelines of how to achieve an arbitrage whenever one is identified. The conditions are also specialised for the more realistic case in which the investor is faced with a ‘take it or leave it …",Sheldon M Ross,0,,Journal of Bond Trading & Management,1,20-26,,Conditions for arbitrage in investment selections,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12432316602424444984&hl=en&oi=scholarr,1,,,B6H9ZbMAAAAJ:MpfHP-DdYjUC

1014322,"The Tenth International Conference on Mathematical Methods in Reliability, MMR 2017, held in Grenoble, France, during July 3-7, entailed a panel discussion entitled “Is Reliability a New Science?” with Mark Brown, Regina Liu, William Meeker, Sheldon Ross, and Nozer Singpurwalla as panelists. Bill Meeker also doubled as a chair and as a moderator of the panel. The panel discussion was spawned by the recent appearance of a book by Professor Paolo Rocchi, Docent Emeritus of IBM, titled “Reliability is a New Science: Gnedenko was Right”, published by Springer in 2017. The panel discussion was well attended and enthusiastically received, and could serve as a forerunner to other such panel discussions at future MMR conferences.

1014326,"A typical approach to estimate an unknown quantity pu is to design an experiment that produces a random variable Z distributed in [0, 1] with E [Z]= p, run this experiment independently a number of times and use the average of the outcomes as the estimate. In this paper, we consider the case when no a priori information about Z is known ercept that is distributed in [0, 1]. We describe an approrimation algorithm... AA which, given e and ð, when running independent ezperiments with respect to any Z, produces an estimate that is within a factor 1--e of pu with probability at least 1–ő.

1014329,"A well-designed study is crucial for the success of any scientific investigation. Despite advances in optimal design theory in the last few decades, applications to find efficient designs in biomedical studies have been sporadic. Part of the reason may be that the theory can be complicated and the optimal design is not easily determined for a specific problem.I briefly review the mathematical foundation of optimal design and discuss recent development in the field, including applications to find efficient designs for biomedical studies. To promote optimal design ideas in scientific research and facilitate practitioners’ access to optimal designs, I present a website that generates a variety of optimal designs for a broad range of models. The user first selects a suitable model from a list of statistical models on the website and an optimality criterion, and then inputs design parameters for his or her problem.
