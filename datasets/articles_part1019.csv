To assess the temporal and spatial variation in respiration rates of these components in a heterogeneous ponderosa pine forest canopy, and the processes that control these fluxes, we conducted an intensive field study during the summer of 2000. We employed a combination of biological and micrometeorological measurements to assess carbon respiratory fluxes at the soil surface, within and above a 4-m-tall ponderosa pine forest. We also conducted manipulation studies to examine the carbon fluxes from the roots and heteorotrophs.Spatial variation in soil CO2 efflux was large, averaging 40% of the mean, which varied by nearly a factor of two between minima for bare soil to maxima beneath dense patches of understorey vegetation.

The sap flow method provides a continuous record of sap velocity and an estimate of tree transpiration. The eddy covariance method typically measures evaporation rates between a forest and the atmosphere. We deployed an extra eddy covariance system below the forest to estimate canopy transpiration by difference.The three systems detected small water vapor fluxes despite a plentiful supply of energy to drive evaporation. We also observed that transpiration rates were low even when the soil was well supplied with water. Low rates of transpiration were attributed to the canopy's low leaf area index and the marked reduction in stomatal conductance …",Bernard Saugier and André Granier and JY Pontailler and Eric Dufrene and DD Baldocchi,185,17987146053209817862,Tree Physiology,8-9,511-519,Heron Publishing,"Transpiration of a boreal pine forest measured by branch bag, sap flow and micrometeorological methods",https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article-abstract/17/8-9/511/1691810,17,1997,/scholar?cites=17987146053209817862,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C

Our ability to predict this flux remains limited because of multiple controlling mechanisms that interact over different temporal and spatial scales. However, new advances in measurement and analyses present an opportunity for the scientific community to improve the understanding of the mechanisms that regulate soil respiration. In this paper, we address several recent advancements in soil respiration research from experimental measurements and data analysis to new considerations for model-data integration. We focus on the links between the soil–plant-atmosphere continuum at short (i.e., diel) and medium (i.e., seasonal-years) temporal scales.

1019128," The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) varies at time scales from seconds to years and longer via the response of its components, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (RE), to physical and biological drivers. Quantifying the relationship between flux and climate at multiple time scales is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the role of climate in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Orthonormal wavelet transformation (OWT) can quantify the strength of the interactions between gappy eddy covariance flux and micrometeorological measurements at multiple frequencies while expressing time series variance in few energetic wavelet coefficients, offering a low-dimensional view of the response of terrestrial carbon flux to climatic variability. The variability of NEE, GEP and RE, and their co-variability with dominant climatic drivers, are explored with nearly one thousand site-years of data from the FLUXNET global dataset consisting of 253 eddy covariance research sites. The NEE and GEP wavelet spectra were similar among plant functional types (PFT) at weekly and shorter time scales, but significant divergence appeared among PFT at the biweekly and longer time scales, at which NEE and GEP were relatively less variable than climate. The RE spectra rarely differed among PFT across time scales as expected. On average, RE spectra had greater low frequency (monthly to interannual) variability than NEE, GEP and climate.

1019186,"A plant canopy consists of an assemblage of plants with leaves that possess a particular spatial distribution and assortment of angle orientations (de Wit, 1965; Monsi et al., 1973). How a collection of leaves intercepts sunlight and uses light energy to assimilate CO2 is the basis of canopy photosynthesis. The major factors affecting canopy photosynthesis, through light interception, include the angular relationship between leaves and Earth—sun geometry and the leaves’ vertical and horizontal positions. Other factors affecting canopy photosynthesis include environmental conditions (temperature, wind speed, humidity, and CO2 concentration), the life history of leaves, the availability of soil moisture and nutrients, stomatal conductance, and speciﬁc photosynthetic pathways (Schulze, 1986; Gutschick, 1991; Stenberg et al., 1995). The complexity of canopy photosynthesis can be illustrated with a closed canopy on a fair day during the growing season. Inside the canopy some leaves are fully sunlit, others are exposed to frequent sunﬂecks, and the re-mainder exist in deep, but occasionally punctuated, shade (Chazdon, I988; Oker~ Blom et al., 1991). Many sunlit leaves of C3 species will experience saturated rates of carboxylation if CO2 supply is limited (Farquhar and von Caemmerer, 1982). Furthermore, sunlit leaves are often warmer than shaded leaves. This situation promotes dark respiration (Amthor, 1994), de-creases the solubility of CO2 relative to O2 (Farquhar et al., 1980), and de-creases the CO2 speciﬁcity factor of ribulose, bisphosphate, and carboxy-lase/oxygenase (rubisco)(Harley and Tenhunen, 1991).

In a leafless, wintertime forest the FD is unimodal and skewed. In a leafing forest, the FD is highly variable and is strongly skewed. This results from higher solar elevation angles enhancing PAR penetration and new, expanding leaves causing penumbral shade and scattering the incoming radiation. The FD of PAR in the fully-leafed canopy is unimodal in the upper canopy, bimodal below crown closure and unimodal in the subcanopy trunkspace. Low solar elevation angles and leaf senescence cause the FD of PAR in the autumnal canopy to be uniformly distributed, as is indicated by its low kurtosis. FDs of PAR also provide a means of estimating sunlit leaf area.

1019231,"The ability to accurately monitor and anticipate changes in consumptive water use associated with changing land use and land management is critical to developing sustainable water management strategies in water-limited climatic regions. In this paper, we present an application of a remote sensing data fusion technique for developing high spatiotemporal resolution maps of evapotranspiration (ET) at scales that can be associated with changes in land use. The fusion approach combines ET map timeseries developed using an multi-scale energy balance algorithm applied to thermal data from Earth observation platforms with high spatial but low temporal resolution (eg, Landsat) and with moderate resolution but frequent temporal coverage (eg, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)). The approach is applied over the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region in California—an area critical to both agricultural production and drinking water supply within the state that has recently experienced stresses on water resources due to a multi-year (2012–2017) extreme drought. ET “datacubes” with 30-m resolution and daily timesteps were constructed for the 2015–2016 water years and related to detailed maps of land use developed at the same spatial scale. The ET retrievals are evaluated at flux sites over multiple land covers to establish a metric of accuracy in the annual water use estimates, yielding root-mean-square errors of 1.0, 0.8, and 0.3 mm day− 1 at daily, monthly, and yearly timesteps, respectively, for all sites combined.

1019234,"Forests currently provide services to communities for conservation and biodiversity of wildlife, watershed and soil protection, for recreation and amenity, for sport and for landscape, in addition to timber production. To these goals should now be added ‘carbon forestry’, the direct role of forest management in protecting forest carbon stocks and enhancing forest sink capacity for carbon. Best estimates indicate that over the past decade terrestrial vegetation, particularly woods and forests, was responsible for the removal of about 40% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) being put into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change (Royal Society, 2001). Now that we appreciate that forests have a vital role in the global carbon budget, forest management should take on responsibility to protect existing carbon stocks and to increase them through enhancement of the forest sink capacity. The recent developing emphasis on continuous cover forestry coupled with selective harvesting goes some way in this direction, but not far enough. Positive measures are particularly required to conserve and enhance soil carbon stocks in forests. A key question is whether we can hope to maintain or even enhance removal of CO2 from the atmosphere in the immediate future by planting trees, and get credit for so doing. In our view, we are really only concerned with the next 50–100 years. Within that period, emissions of CO2 are likely to increase to such an extent that our problems will become insuperable, unless a practical source of alternative energy is developed before then.

1019262,"Plant ecosystems are major players in the carbon cycle—they take up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis and release it in respiration at rates that are nonlinear functions of temperature. How net carbon exchange by terrestrial ecosystems will be affected by projected global warming, and by the increased incidence of extreme climatic events, is a question under intense investigation. Ciais et al. 1 (page 529 of this issue) have taken advantage of an episode of heat and drought that affected Europe during the summer of 2003 to evaluate how net carbon exchange of ecosystems responded. The context to this research is well known. Anthropogenic combustion of fossil fuels has caused mean concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere to reach and exceed 380 parts per million (ppm) 2, a level that is about 100 ppm greater than in pre-industrial times3. Because CO2 absorbs long-wave energy, it warms the Earth’s atmosphere. Additional inputs of carbon to the atmosphere will produce further warming and may contribute to the occurrence of more-intense spells of heat4. But how can we estimate the effects of warming trends and extreme events on ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration? Manipulative experiments that warm ecosystems with infrared lamps provide some insight into these questions5. However, such studies are generally confined to short vegetation in small plots, so their findings do not scale well to the dimensions of forests and continents.

1019271,"Oak trees and their savanna woodlands have played many important roles in the history, development and ecology of California, and the American West (Pavlik et al. 1991; Tyler, Kuhn, and Davis 2006). Starting with the Spanish Mission period through today, cattle have grazed the oak savanna, producing beef for our dinner, leather for our shoes and tallow for our soap. In the mid 19 th century, 49’ers mined the oak savanna for gold and used its wood for cooking, heating and building mine shafts. Today, the oak savanna provides many ecological services and benefits to the region. Oak savannas vegetate the watersheds of the many rivers stemming from the Sierra Nevada and Coastal mountain ranges. By doing so, they protect the soils of this hilly terrain, they provide habitat for wildlife and acorns that have sustained the Native American population and wildlife for millennia. From a hydrologic perspective, runoff from these watersheds provides water for a large fraction of California’s multi-billion dollar agricultural economy and its population of 35 million, plus, inhabitants. Despite, their intrinsic value, California’s oak savannas are suffering in today’s world.

In general, the biosphere inhales CO2 during its hemisphere’s summer and exhales CO2 during its winter. Superimposed upon this general pattern, however, is much complexity and variability due to temporal and spatial gradients in climate, available resources, plant structure and function, land use, and soil development. Technically, the biosphere’s breathing can be quantified by assessing net ecosystem productivity, the balance between natural sources and sinks of carbon dioxide. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP; grams of carbon per square meter per year [g C m-2y-1]) is defined as the difference between gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco): NEP= GPP–RecoGPP is defined as the amount carbon dioxide that is assimilated by plants through photosynthesis. Alternatively, we can define GPP as the sum of net primary productivity, NPP, and autotrophic respiration, Rauto. As a rule of thumb, autotrophic respiration, or NPP, constitutes about half of GPP (Gifford 1994), and Rauto is about two-thirds of ecosystem respiration (Falge et al. 2002).",Dennis Baldocchi and Riccardo Valentini,25,7139967760544181679,SCOPE-SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE ON PROBLEMS OF THE ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF SCIENTIFIC UNIONS,,295-316,,Geographic and temporal variation of carbon exchange by ecosystems and their sensitivity to environmental perturbations,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Fw-8BwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA295&dq=info:ry36WtlCFmMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=SnHNhBvBvA&sig=aUnPCycbdtSu_znfVxCkonjTYRc,62,2004,/scholar?cites=7139967760544181679,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C

How does that forest form interact with climate to affect functioning? How will the form and function of forests change in the future as the environment changes?

Throughout these changes, fog frequency exhibited a consistent north‐south trend, with maxima in southern latitudes. We analyzed seven decades of meteorological data and five decades of air pollution data to determine the most likely drivers changing fog, including temperature, dew point depression, precipitation, wind speed, and NOx (oxides of nitrogen) concentration. Climate variables, most critically dew point depression, strongly influence the short‐term (annual) variability in fog frequency; however, the frequency of optimal conditions for fog formation show no observable trend from 1980 to 2016.

1019339,"Water use efficiency (WUE) defines the ratio of plant carbon gain to water loss and provides a critical link between carbon and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding this link is central to assessing how plants and ecosystems respond to climate change. At the leaf level, WUE is often assessed using stable carbon isotopes, which relates most directly to the ratio of net assimilation (A) to stomatal conductance (g). Although stable isotopes are useful for assessing time-averaged A/g, they are difficult to quantify at canopy or larger spatial scales. Leaf gas exchange can provide direct measurements of A and g and therefore provides information on the causes of variation in WUE, yet, it is generally limited to individual leaves at instantaneous time-scales.

1019340,"Plant water status is a major factor influencing burning potential of vegetation and a low-cost method to assess the water status can provide an index for fire potential. It can also reduce costs associated with travel to remote locations and can improve fire forecast models. Under severe water stress, plant stomata close and reduce the actual evapotranspiration rate (ETa) relative to the potential evapotranspiration rate (ETp). A fire potential index (I= 1-ETa/ETp) is a measure of vegetation burning potential. When there is no ET reducing water stress, I= 0 and it increases as the ETa rate decreases relative to ETp. The difficulty in the application of a fire index is the cost and complexity to measure or estimate ETa and ETp. From solar radiation (Rs) measurements and site specific calibration, it is possible to estimate net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux density (G). If a good estimate of sensible heat flux density is available, then latent heat flux density (LE) can be calculated as the residual of the energy balance equation (LE= Rn–G-H). The surface renewal (SR) method for estimating sensible heat flux from canopies provides a simple, portable, robust, and low-cost method to measure sensible heat flux density (H). High frequency temperature data are collected with fine-wire thermocouples. The data are analyzed with a structure function to identify average ramp characteristics (ie, amplitude and duration) of the temperature traces during a sampling period. Then the amplitude and duration are used in a conservation of energy equation to estimate H. This method has been used over a wide variety of crops and natural vegetation with good results.

Only data from the grazed grassland will be presented here. The flux measurement, along with measurements of meteorological and soil parameters, were start at the end of October 2000. Results from almost one year's data indicated that most of variance of the CO2 flux can be explained by changes in soil water content and leaf area index (LAI).

Long-term measurements from these sites have often found positive values of NEP. When scaled up using simple methods, these measurements imply higher rates of regional-scale carbon sequestration than are calculated by inverse modelling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. This has raised the question as to whether there are biases inherent in the eddy covariance technique itself, or in the scaling procedures, which complicate the interpretation of the data.

The methodologies for quantifying the contributions from wet deposition are well known. Techniques for making direct measurements of dry deposition are available but only for short research intensive experiments. The demands placed on the instrumentation and operator skills are such that routine application of these techniques are not yet possible. Consequently, the use of models has been advocated as a means of deriving spatial and temporal trends of dry deposition rates. In the fall of 1984, a small network of dry deposition research sites was established. It has since evolved to a total of 13 stations (Figure 1).

1019441,"Atmospheric methane (CH4) is the second-most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas following carbon dioxide (CO2)(Myhre et al. 2013). The concentration of CH4 in the atmosphere today is about 2.5 times higher than in 1750 (Saunois et al. 2016a). The increase in atmospheric CH4 has arisen from human activities in agriculture, energy production, and waste disposal, and from changes in natural CH4 sources and sinks (Saunois et al. 2016a, b, 2017; Turner et al. 2019). Based on top-down atmospheric inversions, global CH4 emissions for the decade of 2003–12 were an estimated~ 420 Tg C yr–1 (range 405–426 Tg C yr–1)(Saunois et al. 2016a). However, some analyses suggest that uncertainties in global CH4 sources and sinks are higher than those for CO2, and uncertainties from natural sources exceed those from anthropogenic emissions (Saunois et al. 2016a). In particular, the largest source of uncertainty in the global CH4 budget is related to emissions from wetlands and inland waters (Saunois et al. 2016a; Melton et al. 2013; Bastviken et al. 2011). Wetland CH4 emissions may contribute as much as 25%–40% of the global total and are a leading source of interannual variability in total atmospheric CH4 concentrations (Bousquet et al. 2006; Chen and Prinn 2006; Saunois et al. 2016a).",SARA H KNOX and ROBERT B JACKSON and BENJAMIN POULTER and GAVIN MCNICOL and ETIENNE FLUETTCHOUINARD and ZHEN ZHANG and GUSTAF HUGELIUS and PHILIPPE BOUSQUET and JOSEP G CANADELL and MARIELLE SAUNOIS and DARIO PAPALE and HOUSEN CHU and TREVOR F KEENAN and DENNIS BALDOCCHI and MARGARET S TORN and IVAN MAMMARELLA and CARLO TROTTA and MIKA AURELA and GIL BOHRER and DAVID I CAMPBELL and ALESSANDRO CESCATTI and SAMUEL CHAMBERLAIN and JIQUAN CHEN and WEINAN CHEN and SIGRID DENGEL and ANKUR R DESAI and EUGENIE EUSKIRCHEN and THOMAS FRIBORG and DANIELE GASBARRA and IGNACIO GODED and MATHIAS GOECKEDE and MARTIN HEIMANN and MANUEL HELBIG and TAKASHI HIRANO and DAVID Y HOLLINGER and HIROKI IWATA and MINSEOK KANG and JANINA KLATT and KENW KRAUSS and LARS KUTZBACH and ANNALEA LOHILA and BHASKAR MITRA and TIMOTHY H MORIN and MATS B NILSSON and SHULI NIU and ASKO NOORMETS and WALTER C OECHEL and MATTHIAS PEICHL and OLLI PELTOLA and MICHELE L REBA and ANDREW D RICHARDSON and BENJAMIN RK RUNKLE and YOUNGRYEL RYU and TORSTEN SACHS and KARINA VR SCHÄFER and HANS PETER SCHMID and NARASINHA SHURPALI and OLIVER SONNENTAG and ANGELA CI TANG and MASAHITO UEYAMA and RODRIGO VARGAS and TIMO VESALA and ERIC J WARD and LISAMARIE WINDHAMTMYERS and GEORG WOHLFAHRT and DONATELLA ZONA,0,,,,,,FLUXNET-CH,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/224972841.pdf,,2019,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:ybgmOu3m07wC

Obviously a ‘Big-Leaf’model cannot capture the impact of these gradients on mass and energy exchange. Yet, based on our discussion of scaling and integration principles, such heterogeneities can be perceived to be very important, as many trace gas algorithms are non-linear functions of environmental variables that possess non-Gaussian probability distributions. The next level of model complexity in our mathematical “zoo of models” is the multiplayer approach.Numerous one-dimensional, multi-layer biosphere-atmosphere gas exchange models exist to compute water vapor, CO2 and isoprene flux densities. Contemporary models consist of coupled micrometeorological and eco-physiological modules. The micrometeorological modules compute leaf and soil energy exchange, wind, momentum transfer, turbulent diffusion, scalar concentration profiles and radiative transfer through the canopy. Environmental variables, computed with the micrometeorological module, in turn, drive the physiological modules that compute leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration and leaf, bole and soil/root respiration.

1019489,"In assessing eddy covariance data, especially from shared network databases, one needs to be cognizant of all the pitfalls and errors that may be associated with these data. Errors and uncertainties can arise from poor quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC). Another set of errors stem from improper sensor performance associated with calibration drifts, spikes, sensor noise, signal filtering and if the analog to digital conversion is too coarse or if the sensor goes off range. Violation of the assumptions on which the eddy covariance method is based, like insufficient fetch, advection, storage, sampling too slow or too short can cause errors; these were treated in the previous chapter. And if these questionable data are rejected and replaced with gap filling methods there is uncertainty in the gap filling technique. These are among the topics discussed in this chapter.When discussing uncertainty, we have to consider the two major types we may encounter. Eddy fluxes are affected by random and bias errors [Moncrieff et al., 1996]. Random errors tend to get smaller and smaller as long term averages are constructed. The bias errors are the most difficult to assess, minimize and remove. They can be fully or selectively systematic. The latter corresponds with nighttime flux loss associated with nocturnal CO2 exchange, when there is a decoupling of flow within and above the canopy; we will discuss this topic more in later sections. It is serious with CO2 exchange because it is of opposite sign and can be large. If this nocturnal loss is underestimated, large biases in annual net carbon exchange can accumulate.

1019507,"Eddy-covariance measurements of carbon dioxide, water vapour and energy provide direct evidence for the biosphere-atmosphere exchange at the ecosystem scale. Such continuous measurements are typically performed in the atmospheric surface layer above the canopy and integrate fluxes over the entire ecosystem within the footprint.

Concurrent eddy-covariance measurements below canopy (subcanopy) can provide valuable insights on (1) understory processes,(2) their contributions to total ecosystem fluxes, and (3) the partitioning of component fluxes.

These systems serve as representative sites for biomes in Mediterranean climates and experience much seasonal and inter-annual variability in temperature and precipitation. These sites hence serve as natural laboratories for how whole ecosystem will respond to warmer and drier conditions. The savanna proved to be a moderate sink of carbon, taking up about 150 gC m-2y-1 compared to the annual grassland, which tended to be carbon neutral and often a source during drier years. But this carbon sink by the savanna came at a cost. This ecosystem used about 100 mm more water per year than the grassland. And because the savanna was darker and rougher its air temperature was about 0.5 C warmer. In addition to our flux measurements, we collected vast amounts of ancillary data to interpret the site and fluxes, making this site a key site for model validation and parameterization.

Based on direct observations we predict that sustained CH 4 emissions in natural ecosystems are in the long term (ie, several centuries) typically offset by CO 2 uptake, although with large spatiotemporal variability. Using a space-for-time analogy across ecological and climatic gradients, we represent the chronosequence from natural to managed conditions to quantify the “cost” of CH 4 emissions for the benefit of net carbon sequestration. With a sustained pulse–response radiative forcing model, we found a significant increase in atmospheric forcing due to land management, in particular for wetland converted to cropland.

The optimal height for detecting fluxes, however, changes in time with the environmental conditions at the site. In some instances, a measurement such as friction velocity (u*) can indicate when data should be eliminated. When u* is high however, data are not eliminated but sensors may not actually be detecting fluxes from the ecosystem of interest.

This effort is novel because it is the first system that harmonizes and utilizes MODIS Atmosphere and Land products on the same projection and spatial resolution over the global land. This enabled us to use the MODIS Atmosphere products to calculate atmospheric radiative transfer for visual and near infrared radiation wave bands. Then we coupled atmospheric and canopy radiative transfer processes, with models that computed leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and transpiration on the sunlit and shaded portions of the vegetation and soil. At the annual time step, the mass and energy fluxes derived from BESS showed strong linear relations with measurements of solar irradiance (r (2)= 0.95, relative bias: 8%), gross primary productivity (r (2)= 0.86, relative bias: 5%) and evapotranspiration (r (2)= 0.86, relative bias: 15%) in data from 33 flux towers that cover seven plant functional types across arctic to tropical climatic zones. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration computed in BESS were most sensitive to leaf area index and solar irradiance, respectively. We quantified the mean global terrestrial estimates of gross primary productivity and evapotranpiration between 2001 and 2003 as 118+/-26 PgC yr (-1) and 500+/-104 mm yr (-1)(equivalent to 63,000+/-13,100 km (3) yr (-1)), respectively.

1019586,"It is well known that microbial-mediated soil respiration, the major source of CO2 from terrestrial ecosystems, is sensitive to temperature. Here, we hypothesize that some mechanisms, such as acclimation of microbial respiration to temperature and/or regulation by plant fresh C inputs of the temperature sensitivity of decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), should be taken into account to predict soil respiration correctly. Specifically, two hypotheses were tested:(1) under warm conditions, temperature sensitivity (Q10) and basal rates of microbial-mediated soil respiration (Bs20, respiration at a given temperature) would be primarily subjected to presence/absence of plant fresh C inputs; and (2) under cold conditions, where labile C depletion occurred more slowly, microbial-mediated soil respiration could adjust its optimal temperatures to colder temperatures (acclimation), resulting in a net increase of respiration rates for a given temperature (Bs20). For this purpose, intact soil cores from an oak savanna ecosystem were incubated with sufficient water supply at two contrasting temperatures (10 and 30 C) during 140 days. To study temperature sensitivity of soil respiration, short-term temperature cycles (from 5 to 40 C at 8 h steps) were applied periodically to the soils. Our results confirmed both hypotheses. Under warm conditions ANCOVA and likelihood ratio tests confirmed that both Q10 and Bs20 decreased significantly during the incubation.

1019587,"Ecophysiological processes are modeled in a variety of ways depending on the scales and questions examined, and representations of newly discovered or analyzed processes tend to encourage greater numbers of model parameters. We look at representations of stomatal and plant conductance in a soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer model, and examine how leaf water potential plays a critical role in governing fluxes between plants and the atmosphere. Sensitivity analysis of this model reveals the circumstances in which the number of parameters can be reduced, raising the model’s overall parsimony. Recent advances in the traditional generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE; Beven and Binley, 1992) have allowed a more targeted approach to parameter reduction by using the results of a numerical optimal parameter search. The dynamically dimensioned search–approximation of uncertainty (DDS-AU) method developed by Tolson and Shoemaker (2008) is used to analyze the sensitivity and correlation of model parameters governing stomatal conductance. This heuristic approach starts with a global search algorithm that progressively becomes more local as the number of model iterations approaches a pre-determined maximum number of desired iterations, and has been shown to be more efficient than the uniform random sampling approach used in most GLUE applications.These results are presented in the context of an invasive species infestation in California’s Sacramento River-San Francisco Bay Delta region, which is a critical component of California’s water distribution system and agriculturally important in its own …",BRK Runkle and DD Baldocchi and X Liang,0,,,,,,Improving ecophysiological representations through numerical sensitivity analysis: Determining controls on stomatal conductance in an invasive species,https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/TERRABITES/TERRABITES-50.pdf,,2010,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC

Plants, for example, abhor a vacuum and tend to fill niches if there is ample water, sunlight and soil. So ultimately, the upper limit of water, carbon and energy fluxes is set by amount of energy intercepted at the Earth’s surface, which scales with the solar constant.

Many studies in northern peatlands have demonstrated the importance of wetness on atmospheric efflux and concentration of methane (CH4). In managed temperate peatlands such as Sherman Island located within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, the monitoring of wetness poses a major challenge since hydrological input includes irrigation through a complex network of ditches and canals in addition to precipitation. The objective of this study is to investigate the capability of six spectral vegetation indices (SVI) to capture the seasonal dynamics of near surface wetness within the day-and nighttime CH4 concentration footprints of the EC tower located on Sherman Island, and ultimately to investigate the capability of these SVI to capture the seasonal dynamics of …",M Detto and O Sonnentag and B Runkle and D Baldocchi and M Kelly,0,,AGUFM,,B33B-0421,,Using MODIS reflectance products to monitor wetness and methane fluxes and concentration in a managed temperate peatland in California,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.B33B0421D/abstract,2008,2008,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:1DsIQWDZLl8C

These two factors are also defining characteristics of Mediterranean savannas during the summer, the period of foliation. Thus, we proposed that mesophyll conductance would be a large contributor in limiting photosynthesis. We set out to measure gm by a variety of methods as well as maximum photosynthetic rates (Amax), photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax), stomatal conductance (gs), and other photosynthetic parameters. Our goal was to understand how gm changes throughout the period of foliation and how these changes contribute to the changes of photosynthesis.

Trees that varied in diameter (at breast height, ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 m) were sampled during the summer drought (June-September) in two subsequent years. Preliminary results showed large differences among trees in δ 13 C of leaf soluble carbohydrates (from-24â to-28â), but each tree's δ 13 C remained relatively constant over time. This indicated that intrinsic WUE (ratio of carbon assimilation to stomatal conductance to water loss) was also constant, despite decreasing soil water content and leaf water potentials. Differences among trees could not be explained by either tree size or differential use of soil water sources (estimated by δ 18 O of soil and xylem water).

The savanna functioned as a carbon sink; its annual NEE ranged between‑145±47 and‑31±65 gC m-2 yr-1. Extremely high nitrogen concentrations, up to~ 3.5%, were found in oak and grass leaves during the dry year, and the extreme foliage nitrogen maintained longer than other years. It indicated that remaining high nitrogen concentration in photosynthesis tissues (eg, leaf) might be one of important strategies of the plants to maintain necessary rates of carbon assimilation during a profoundly dry year. Because water deficits limited nitrogen uptake during the dry spring, leaf obtained nitrogen primarily from nitrogen stored in the tree. Water deficit limited nitrogen uptake of the tree during the late season, and consequently deficiency of nitrogen storage influenced leaf nitrogen in the year following the dry year. Our results provided an explanation why year-to-year variations in water supplies (ie, precipitation) significantly controlled on interannual variability in carbon uptake of the savanna ecosystems.",Siyan Ma and Dennis D Baldocchi and Jessica L Osuna and Stefania Mambelli and Jorge Curiel Yuste and Liukang Xu,0,,,,,,PS 40-8: Drought tolerant and carbon uptake resulting from year-to-year nitrogen storage in deciduous oak savanna,https://eco.confex.com/eco/2007/techprogram/P6117.HTM,,2007,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC

Comparing with canopy carbon storage term estimated with the 4-layer profile data, carbon storage term was overestimated 31% if only the 2-point CO 2 concentration was applied. CO 2 concentration showed significant diurnal pattern, and the diurnal variation was changeable in seasons.

However the spatial resolution of the tower sites is limited and additional information is needed to provide the Global Change Research community with an accurate way to identify and quantify carbon sources and sinks on regional, continental and global scales. Remote sensing is a major tool capable of providing information about the dynamics of the terrestrial biosphere with continuous spatial and temporal coverage on a global scale. For this purpose vegetation indices (VI's) are chosen specifically to enhance the contribution of vegetation properties to surface reflectances. Remote sensing products generally produce information on GPP (or net primary productivity, NPP), in terms of a light use efficiency (ε) and the amount of absorbed visible sunlight (fPAR). Linking remote sensing with FLUXNET sites is crucial in providing reliable estimates of the magnitude and dynamics of the terrestrial carbon budget. An important issue is the spatial mismatch between the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and the footprint of tower observations.

1019657,"Recent projections of climatic change have focused a great deal of scientific and public attention on patterns of carbon (C) cycling as well as its controls, particularly the factors that determine whether an ecosystem is a net source or sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Net ecosystem production (NEP), a central concept in C-cycling research, has been used by scientists to represent two different concepts. We propose that NEP be restricted to just one of its two original definitions—the imbalance between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). We further propose that a new term—net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB)—be applied to the net rate of C accumulation in (or loss from [negative sign]) ecosystems. Net ecosystem carbon balance differs from NEP when C fluxes other than C fixation and respiration occur, or when inorganic C enters or leaves in dissolved form. These fluxes include the leaching loss or lateral transfer of C from the ecosystem; the emission of volatile organic C, methane, and carbon monoxide; and the release of soot and CO2 from fire. Carbon fluxes in addition to NEP are particularly important determinants of NECB over long time scales. However, even over short time scales, they are important in ecosystems such as streams, estuaries, wetlands, and cities. Recent technological advances have led to a diversity of approaches to the measurement of C fluxes at different temporal and spatial scales.

1019660,"History has shown that many of the technological advances in micrometeorological measurement methods and techniques were facilitated by agronomic research into understanding plant-water relationships and photosynthesis (Deacon & Swinbank, 1958; Lemon, 1960; Suomi & Tanner, 1960; Tanner, 1960). Even today, many research programs are focusing on a better understanding of the water balance on regional and continental scales with a goal of providing useful probabilistic forecasts that will lead to more effective planning of the use of water resources in areas where water is limited or stricken by drought (Lawford, 1999). The need to understand and predict components of the water and carbon cycle on seasonal and annual time scales has pushed the micrometeorological technology to work not only for short duration intensive experiments, but for much longer periods (Baldocchi et al., 2001; Running et al., 1999; Grelle & Lindroth, 1996).Many agricultural research activities include short-term intensive experiments in which the emission or deposition of some chemical species is to be quantified. Along with the more common species like water vapor and CO,, fluxes of other chemical species have become important in agriculture. They include N compounds such as NH „HNO,. NO, other greenhouse gases such as CH4 and N, O, pollutants such as O, and SO,, and many pesticides (Majewski et al., 1989).

1019664,"Visual examination of the scalar traces has revealed ramp like patterns in scalars (called coherent or organized structures) over and within plant canopies and over bare soil. Field studies suggest that the ramp-like patterns are responsible for the majority of scalar exchange in the canopy-atmosphere interface. Each ramp-like event represents an injection of flux of the scalar across a surface located at the measurement height, so the sum of all injections over a given time period may permit estimates of the mean flux. In our paradigm, we neglect advection and abstract the scalar trace as a sequence of N identical ramp events (defined by an amplitude A and frequency L), and in addition, carry out our analysis for the quiescent portion of the coherent structures. If during this quiescent period, the mixing is driven by quasi-homogeneous smaller scale motions, the turbulent eddy diffusion coefficient for heat (Kh) can be assumed constant. Such an assumption permits (using the one-dimensional turbulent diffusion equation) the linkage of the vertical gradient with the air temperature history. This ultimately allows one to derive an expression for estimating Kh and the aerodynamic resistance for heat using temperature measurements as input under unstable conditions. It will be shown that the expressions performed well under unstable conditions during an experiment carried out during year 2002 over rangeland grass (0.25 m tall at Ione, Ca) and measuring air temperature at 10 Hz at a level of 2 m height with a fine-wire thermocouple (0.0127 mm diameter).",F Castellví and RL Snyder and DD Baldocchi,0,,26th Conference on Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,,,,Estimating the turbulent eddy difussion and aerodynamic resistance for heat under unstable conditions using air temperature measurements as input,https://ams.confex.com/ams/AFAPURBBIO/techprogram/paper_79075.htm,,2004,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:2vr6o8x5NLkC
1019665,"1. Objectives We intend to show that measured and modeled averages of latent heat flux over large areas can be scaled, if we know how the ensemble spatial variance of the independent variables depend on the 1 spatial resolution. The question arises that one often has mean fields of temperature, water vapor concentration, and net radiation, which may or may not produce the correct ensemble average latent heat flux. The spatial ensemble average of a product may be expressed as: y x space space r yx xy σ σ+= where r is the correlation coefficient, and σ is the spatial standard deviation. The above relationship may be applied to the independent variables of the Penman-Monteith equation.As our starting point, we take the geophysical tutorial Daisyworld (Watson and Lovelock 1983), modified for moist, dark and dry, bright daisies, or fictional plant functional types. We then move on to a spatially explicit form of Daisyworld with real plant functional types, and examine its spatial scaling.

1019666,"Two sets of solid-state infrared CO2 sensors were used in the flux-gradient mode to measure soil respiration in an oak grass savanna. We deployed one profile system under a tree and another in the open grassland to quantify the absolute and relative contributions of heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration to soil respiration. During the summer this is possible because the grass is dead, so the only source of respiration from the open space is from the decomposition of dead plant material by microbes. In contrast, respiration measured in the soil under the tree represents the respiratory contributions from roots, mycorhizzae and microbes.During the summer dry season, soil respiration rates under the tree were 4 to 6 times greater than those from the open grassland. Diurnal rates of respiration were modulated by changes in soil temperature and by photosynthesis; daily changes in light and vapor pressure deficits suppressed afternoon photosynthesis and this was later reflected in a subsequent decline in soil respiration. The flux-gradient system also enabled us to quantify the effects of rain on soil respiration. Summer rain storms caused a rapid activation of microbes and their production deep in the soil forces CO2 transfer to be bi-directional and at high rates until the soil dried.",Dennis Baldocchi and Jianwu Tang and Liukang Xu,0,,26th Conference on Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,,,,Evaluating autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration in an oak grass savanna using flux-gradient measurements of soil respiration with new infra-red CO2 sensors,https://ams.confex.com/ams/AFAPURBBIO/techprogram/paper_78750.htm,,2004,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC

They also represent a key method for testing hypotheses about the response of forest ecosystems to multiple changing environmental conditions. This paper describes the evaluation of 13 stand-level models varying in their spatial, mechanistic, and temporal complexity for their ability to capture intra-and interannual components of the water and carbon cycle for an upland, oak-dominated forest of eastern Tennessee. Comparisons between model simulations and observations were conducted for hourly, daily, and annual time steps. Data for the comparisons were obtained from a wide range of methods including: eddy covariance, sapflow, chamber-based soil respiration, biometric estimates of stand-level net primary production and growth, and soil water content by time or frequency domain reflectometry. Response surfaces of carbon and water flux as a function of environmental drivers, and a variety of goodness-of-fit statistics (bias, absolute bias, and model efficiency) were used to judge model performance.A single model did not consistently perform the best at all time steps or for all variables considered. Intermodel comparisons showed good agreement for water cycle fluxes, but considerable disagreement among models for predicted carbon fluxes.

1019668,"This chapter focuses on the diffusion of CO2 from the atmosphere to the leaf interior. CO2 diffusion occurs along a concentration gradient from the bulk atmosphere to the sub-stomatal cavity. Along this gradient there are ‘bottlenecks’, or resistors, which control the rate of flow. The most important of these resistors occur at the leaf and stomatal level. This chapter explores the functioning of these resistors and their importance in constraining CO2 capture.Starting with the resistance that operates at the finest space and time scales, we examine arrangements of stomata on leaves and their relationship to stomatal conductance. Differences in stomatal structures are explored across key functional groups, including their phenotypic plasticity and variations within the canopy and across biomes. Models that have been constructed to analyse and predict stomatal conductance are described and compared. These models that are often key components of current efforts to explore issues ranging from crop and forest production under global change, to plant-water relations, and the global carbon cycle. We then examine how leaf size and shape affects boundary layer conductance, and, at the canopy scale, explore how stomatal and leaf-level constraints on CO2 capture manifest themselves in aggregate. This aggregation is carried up to the global scale to describe patterns of global CO2 capture, and the chapter closes with a discussion of the effects of atmospheric CO2 enrichment on CO2 capture.",M Williams and FI Woodward and DD Baldocchi and D Ellsworth,0,,,,,,CO2 capture from,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathew_Williams/publication/255604105_Chapter_6_CO_2_capture_from_the_leaf_to_the_landscape/links/53f726eb0cf22be01c45362f.pdf,,2004,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:w0F2JDEymm0C

If the scientific community is to globally retrieve photosynthetic rates from space, it must take this seasonality into account.

1019679,"Description Clouds and aerosols alter the proportion of diffuse radiation in global solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. It is known that diffuse and direct beam radiation differ in the way they transfer through plant canopies and affect the summation of nonlinear processes like photosynthesis differently than what would occur at the leaf scale. We compared the relative efficiencies of canopy photosynthesis to diffuse and direct photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for a Scots pine forest, an aspen forest, a mixed deciduous forest, a tallgrass prairie and a winter wheat crop. The comparison was based on the seasonal patterns of the parameters that define the canopy photosynthetic responses to diffuse PAR and those that define the responses to direct PAR. These parameters were inferred from half-hourly tower CO2 flux measurements. We found that:(1) diffuse radiation results in higher light use efficiencies by plant canopies;(2) diffuse radiation has much less tendency to cause canopy photosynthetic saturation;(3) the advantages of diffuse radiation over direct radiation increase with radiation level;(4) temperature as well as vapor pressure deficit can cause different responses in diffuse and direct canopy photosynthesis, indicating that their impacts on terrestrial ecosystem carbon assimilation may depend on radiation regimes and thus sky conditions. These findings call for different treatments of diffuse and direct radiation in models of global primary production, and studies of the roles of clouds and aerosols in global carbon cycle.

1019683,"The cataclysmic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 released about 20 megatons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere. It brought markedly changes to the surface radiation environment over the globe in the next two years with significant enhancement in diffuse radiation (+ 50% in 1992) but only a small reduction in global solar radiation (< 5%). Immediately after the eruption, the rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide rise dropped. Results from d13C measurements and atmospheric inverse modeling studies indicate that this rate drop was due to enhanced carbon uptake by the terrestrial biosphere during the two years following the volcanic eruption.

We present the results of a relatively new approach to using atmospheric CO 2 data to constrain parameters of carbon exchange processes. CO 2 concentration data collected at remote monitoring stations of the NOAA-CMDL network are combined with a biosphere model and an atmospheric transport model to perform a Bayesian synthesis inversion. Rather than inferring regional-to-continental-scale net carbon fluxes as is typically done, we solve for the light-use efficiency (LUE) of net photosynthesis for broad ecosystem types (eg boreal biomes).

The micrometerological eddy correlation method was used to measure flux densities of CO [sub 2] and water vapor over the canopy. Periodic measurements were made of stomatal resistence and pre-dawn water potential to characterize the photosynthetic capacity of the canopy. Three factors accounted for a disproportionate amount of seasonal variance in CO [sub 2] flux densities: photon flux densities, leaf area and the occurrence of drought. Positive and increasing magnitudes of carbon gain were observed between April and June as leaves expanded, the canopy closed and daily insolation increased.

1019710,"The deposition of reactive gases on terrestrial surfaces is one of the primary mechanisms by which pollutant gases are removed from the atmosphere. The chemical properties of the gases (SO2, NO2, HNO3, HCl) and of the absorbing surfaces lead to differing rates of exchange and controlling processes. The most reactive gases, HNO3, HCl (and for many surfaces NH3) exhibit negligible surface resistances; deposition velocities (V.) appropriate for short vegetation ranging from 2 to 5 cm s, for forests V, may approach 10 cm sº'. The large rates of deposition for NH3 on moorland and forests lead to annual inputs, in areas with large atmospheric concentrations of NH3 (> 5 ug NH3 m'), ranging from 20 to 60 kg Nha T'. The net exchange of NH3 over cropland, attributable to deposition during vegetative growth and emission of NH3 during senescence, is less well known but believed to be small. The co-deposition of NH3 and SO2 on external surfaces of plant canopies is believed to enhance SO2 deposition with reported deposition velocities over short vegetation of 2.0 cm sº'.

1019711,"While many studies have examined evaporation from bare soils, few workers have addressed evaporation from forest ﬂoors (see Black and Kclliher, 1989). An understanding of soil and litter evaporation under forest canopies is warranted because a forest ﬂoor is an important source of water vapor in terrestrial ecosystems. Furthermore, separate studies on forest ﬂoor evaporation are needed because there are factors affecting soil/litter evaporation under forests that do not contribute to evaporation from bare soils. For example, litter mulches impede the diffusion of water vapor from the soil and alter the soil’s surface energy balance, temperature and moisture regimes that govern evaporation. Secondly, the presence of vegetation over a litter-soil complex, as compared to an otherwise bare soil, alters the radiation, wind, temperature, precipitation and humidity regime that drive soil/litter evaporation.Most attempts to study soil/atmosphere gas exchange have employed either lysimeters or chambers. Applications of lysimeters and chambers to measure soil/litter evaporation commonly suffer from errors introduced by inadequate spatial sampling and modiﬁcation of the local environment.

1019714,"Stomata are major conduits for the diffusion of many trace gas species between leaves and the atmosphere. The role of the stomata on controlling gas exchange between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere at the landscape, meso-and global-scales has only recently been recognized. Further advances in modelling large-scale trace gas exchange will depend on our ability to understand and model stomatal mechanics at the scale of the pertinent sub-unit, which is typically that of the canopy. This paper describes two approaches for estimating canopy stomatal conductance. One approach is based on'bottom-up'scaling. This approach computes canopy stomatal conductance by integrating detailed leaf-level and environmentally-driven, physiological processes with the use of a detailed canopy micrometeorology model. The other approach is based on'top-down'scaling. It interprets the integrated canopy stomatal conductance from measured fluxes of trace gas exchange. Frameworks for extending these scaling approaches to non-idea conditions are given. 96 refs., 5 figs.",DD Baldocchi and RJ Luxmoore and JL Hatfield,0,,,CONF-8904269-1,,"Oak Ridge National Lab., TN (USA)",Canopy stomatal conductance,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5823531,,1989,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC

In general, the uncertainty regarding dry deposition is a major impediment to the resolution of questions concerning the fate of emissions into the atmosphere, such as are of principal concern to the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP).Except in some special circumstances, existing technology cannot measure dry deposition rates of any trace atmospheric constituent in a routine way. Nor is there any generally recognized simple method by which dry deposition fluxes can be modeled. The difficulties involved have been reviewed extensively elsewhere (1-3). None of the special methods that have been used (including micrometeorology, snowpack accumulation, mass balance calculations, leaf washing, and throughfall studies) is appropriate for all species, nor is any method yet developed to the extent permitting application in other than intensive experiments. The main application of these methods is to develop relationships describing dry deposition, which can then be used to evaluate deposition either from other information generated by models or from measurements of concentrations and other variables at monitoring sites.

1019728,"Ecosystems (vegetation and soils) strongly respond to climate variation in terms of their structure and function, but they also influence climate via exchange of matter and energy with the atmosphere. Recent continuous observations of this exchange of CO2, H2O and sensible heat within the global observation network FLUXNET have enabled us to quantify ecosystem function in response to large eco-climatological spatial gradients and temporal variability of climate. Ecosystem function co-varies strongly with climate, but climate alone does not suffice to explain the variation in total. Instead vegetation biophysical and structural parameters co-determine the biosphere-atmosphere exchanges. By combining ecosystem level observation and information of spatial meteorological and vegetation remote sensing covariates we infer global patterns of ecosystem atmosphere fluxes and derive key ecosystem functional properties globally. While this approach is powerful and meteorological and vegetation structural predictors explain more than 70% of the spatial variation of monthly fluxes at FLUXNET sites, it ignores the effect of ecophysiological vegetation properties, which is expected from plant physiological leaf or whole-plant studies. Hence, future research has to more strongly link the organismic trait information with ecosystem functional properties. For this we propose a data-driven framework that will help to link plant traits from organism to globe. We hypothesize that these studies will emphasize the superiority of a trait based approach over classical structural PFT concepts for modeling global ecosystem functioning, but will also highlight the scale …",M Reichstein and D Baldocchi and M Jung and J Kattge and T Musavi,0,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,,Integrating plant and ecosystem functional biogeography within a data driven Earth System Science approach,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2183435335753283820&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:18U4RWrXZp4C

1019737,"The presence or absence of clouds in a region is a consequence of complex interactions among many atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial processes. It is a physical expression of changes in a number of environmental factors, such as radiation, heat, temperature, moisture, precipitation, etc. All these factors are vital for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, and influence the exchange of energy and mass of terrestrial ecosystems with the overlying atmosphere. In particular, it has been observed that for many forest ecosystems, the maximal net uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) often occurs on cloudy rather than on sunny day. In a previous study, we showed that a boreal deciduous forest and a temperate deciduous forest had maximal carbon uptake under sky conditions with a solar radiation level equivalent to about 70-80% of the corresponding clear-sky solar irradiance. We also demonstrated that the two forests could tolerate a cloud-induced sunlight reduction of as much as 50% without lowering the capacity to sequester carbon as compared with sunny days (Gu et al. 1999). However, uncertainties remain in regard to the mechanism of this phenomenon. Since variations in net carbon uptake can be achieved through changes in photosynthesis, or respiration or both, an interesting question is: does moderate cloudiness increase net carbon uptake by enhancing canopy photosynthesis or by reducing ecosystem respiration or both? Canopy photosynthesis can be enhanced by increased diffuse radiation (Gu et al. 2002) or reduced water stress (Freedman et al. 2001).

Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the amount of carbon ﬁxed by vegetation through photosynthesis and a key component of ecosystem carbon ﬂuxes and the carbon balance between the biosphere and the atmosphere (Makela et al. 2008). The accurate estimation of GPP is essential for the quantification of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) as the latter is often a small difference of two large carbon ﬂuxes—GPP and ecosystem respiration (Re)-The estimation of GPP for regions, continents, or the globe, however, can only be made by using ecosystem models (eg, Prince and Goward 1995) and/or remotely sensed data (eg, Running et al …",J ingfeng Xiao and Qianlai Zhuang and Beverly E Law and J iquan Chen and Dennis D Baldocchi,0,,,,,,A Continuous Measure of Gross Primary Production for the Conterminous US Derived from MODIS and AmeriFlux Data,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13829878002720732859&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:rbm3iO8VlycC
1019741,"We quantified the spatial-temporal roles of photosynthesis, temperature and soil moisture on soil respiration of an oak savanna with a combination of field and laboratory measurements. Canopy photosynthesis was quantified from eddy covariance measurements over and under the woodland. Spatial gradients in soil respiration were surveyed with a portable soil respiration chamber. Contributions to soil respiration by autotrophs and heterotrophs were assessed using profiles of CO2 sensors inserted in the soil under a tree and in the open grassland.At a given spot, soil respiration was a function of soil moisture and temperature and labile carbon pools associated with decomposing organic matter and recent photosynthetic production. Spatial/temporal variations in soil respiration reflect changes in these controlling factors. Spatial transect studies, for example, showed that soil respiration decreased by 60% as one radiates from a tree to the open grassland. Soil respiration measured under a tree crown reflected the sum of rhizosphere respiration and heterotrophic respiration while soil respiration measured in an open area represented heterotrophic respiration when the grass was dead during the summer. Basal rates of soil respiration diminished over the summer as the soil dried and it stressed photosynthetic and microbial activity. Summer rains, on the other hand, were found to stimulate the activity of latent microbes immediately, thereby pulsing soil respiration by more than a factor of 10 until the upper soil layer dries. Continuous measurements of soil respiration revealed that soil respiration under the tree was decoupled with soil temperature …",Dennis Baldocchi and Jianwu Tang and Jorge Curiel-Yuste and Liukang Xu and Siyan Ma,0,,,,,,"Soil Respiration and Carbon Sequestration of an Oak-grass Savanna in California: Roles of temperature, soil moisture, rain events and photosynthesis",https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jorge_Curiel_Yuste/publication/267369381_Soil_Respiration_and_Carbon_Sequestration_of_an_Oak-_grass_Savanna_in_California_Roles_of_temperature_soil_moisture_rain_events_and_photosynthesis/links/545a03b40cf26d5090ad4333.pdf,,,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:NDuN12AVoxsC
1019742,"The first objective of this research is to make the link between the seasonality of fine root dynamics and the carbon balance of the ecosystem. The second objective of this research is to improve our understanding of how canopy photosynthesis influences fine root initiation, growth and mortality. In order to reach these objectives, we combined CO2 flux measurements (at ecosystem, soil, and leaf level) with aboveground (shoot, needle, stem) and belowground (fine root) growth dynamics. The first part of this research was conducted in a young Ponderosa pine plantation at the Blodgett Forest Ameriflux site, located at 1,315 m above sea level in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. One of our hypotheses was that fine root development at our site is a high priority and is tightly coupled to canopy photosynthesis and available soil water. This hypothesis is partially confirmed and mainly holds for the first part of the vegetation period when a tight coupling between photosynthesis and root growth was observed. This relationship appears to change during dry years, when belowground growth is extremely limited, while aboveground growth does not appear to be similarly affected. We found that the seasonal window for optimal root growth is extremely reduced at our site, partially due to low soil temperature during the winter and partially due to soil water stress during summer. However, when large rates of photosynthesis were observed following summer rains during the second part of the vegetation period in 2003, while temperature was optimal, root growth did not resume and mortality rates did not decrease.The second hypothesis was that fine roots …",Allen Goldstein and Weixin Cheng and Dennis Baldocchi and Laurent Misson and Alex Gershenson and Jorge Curiel Yuste,0,,,,,,Controls of Canopy Photosynthetic Activity on Roots and Soil Carbon Dynamics in Ponderosa Pine and Oak/Savanna Ecosystems,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e4ba/ed58af37654a8e6fdebe0aeb433433cda05b.pdf,,,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC
1019743,"Micrometeorological measurements of the exchange of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere are being made at sites worldwide (eg the AmeriFlux, EUROFLUX and AsiaFlux networks) to evaluate responses of exchange rates to biotic and abiotic factors (Baldocchi et al., 2001). Exchange rates, measured via the eddy covariance technique are generally calculated from fast response measurements of three dimensional wind speeds and co-occuring scalar fluctuations (eg, temperature, carbon dioxide, and water vapor).Instrumentation used at various sites is not standardized. Many flux sites in the Europian flux network use a common instrumentation setup with a Gill Solent sonic anemometer and a Licor infrared gas analyzer (often a Licor IRGA model Li-6262), which is not necessarily located near the sonic. Air from the vicinity of the sonic is drawn through a sampling tube to the Licor, where the CO2 and H2O concentration of the sampled air is measured.

1019744,"The climate factors controlling forest carbon dioxide exchange may vary as a function of time scales. This hypothesis is examined using direct measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and meteorological data obtained over multiple years from four forest sites in North America. We find that:(1) the relationship between nighttime NEE (respiration) and temperature is strong on daily, monthly and seasonal time scales, but breaks down on an annual time scale. Autumn respiration rates are 1 to 3 times higher than spring respiration rates and the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration is lower in summer than in spring and autumn.(2) Unlike temperature, precipitation is poorly correlated with NEE on daily, monthly, and seasonal time scales but is well correlated on an annual time scale. Forest NEE is influenced by annual variability in precipitation because soil moisture during the growing season, which is often associated with forest growth and CO2 uptake, is controlled in part by cold season precipitation.(3) Net radiation is a comprehensive climate variable that is related to temperature, light, water vapor, cloud cover, and albedo; and it is correlated with NEE on all time scales.(4) Although NEE is correlated to photosynthetically active radiation on daily, monthly and seasonal time scales, the relationship breaks down on an annual time scale because the respiration component of NEE is not coupled to light.(5) We observe that drought stress has a very strong effect on forest uptake of CO2.

Our results indicate that temperate and boreal conifers should be viewed as separate classes. Generalized seasonal patterns might be utilized by global modelers and in inversion studies, and to validate phenology modules of plot scale models. For the temperate deciduous and boreal conifers, we identified periods of unbalanced respiratory and assimilatory processes, indicating a potentially higher susceptibility to changes in management practices or climatic conditions, especially considering the expected larger increase in nighttime temperatures globally, and greater temperature increases at high latitudes.",EM Falge and D Baldocchi and J Tenhunen,0,,,,,,B51A-0196: SEASONALITY OF ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION AND GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION AS DERIVED FROM FLUXNET MEASUREMENTS,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12731182671427801123&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC

1019749,"Grassland ecosystems of California's Coastal and Central Valley regions have undergone dramatic changes, with the almost complete replacement of native perennial grasses by exotic annuals. Our research compares the ecosystem properties and processes that govern the exchange of carbon, water, and energy in California grasslands before and after the invasion of exotic annual grasses at two sites in northern coastal California. To perform these comparisons, we make use of coastal research sites in which native vegetation is found growing alongside locations that have undergone exotic invasion. The broader goal is to understand how shifts in plant community composition can affect global climate change through 1. shifting the balance of carbon storage between terrestrial stocks and the atmosphere, and 2. altering the water and energy regimes that heat or cool the earth's surface.Our preliminary results indicate that soil carbon storage, the primary carbon stock in these grassland ecosystems is greater in regions dominated by native perennial grass communities. At a site near Bolinas, CA, we found that exotic grass invasion has resulted in a transfer of 50 metric tons of carbon per hectare from the soil to the atmosphere. Over the years 2004–2006, we found energy partitioning into latent and sensible heat fluxes similar among annual and perennial grasses during the portions of the year when water is not limited. When water becomes scarce in the late spring, however, annual grasses die, but the more deeply rooted perennial grasses persist by exploiting deep soil water reserves. Because native perennials remain active, they devote more …",John Harte and Dennis Baldocchi and Laurie Koteen and Shana Tucker and Oriana Zamora,0,,,,,,A Comparison of Carbon Cycling and the Surface Energy Balance between Native Perennial and Exotic Annual Grass Communities in Northern Coastal California,http://kearney.ucdavis.edu/OLD%20MISSION/2005_Final_Reports/2005206Harte_FINALkms.pdf,,,,dJ8MMFoAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C
1019750,"It has been argued from thermodynamic principles that a more ‘developed’ecosystem should have relatively lower surface temperature (Ts) than a less developed counterpart, all else being equal, if entropy production is maximized as ecosystems develop (Schneider and Kay, 1994). The logic behind this argument follows from the maximum entropy production (MEP) principle (Dewar, 2003). For open, non-equilibrium systems subject to external constraints (eg conservation laws and external forcing), such as ecosystems, the most probable macroscopic state, namely the state that follows from more microscopic pathways than any other (Jaynes, 1957), has a higher probability of being selected. In other words, the realization of ecosystem structures that dissipate energy for the production of entropy is a highly probable ecosystem state (Dewar, 2005). This ecosystem state is one that degrades energy (ie produces entropy) most efficiently, with a macroscopic characteristic being cooler Ts. It stands to reason that a highly dissipative state is not realized immediately by ecosystems; rather the chance of this structure occurring increases over time (Kay et al., 2001; Schneider and Kay, 1994).",Paul Stoy and Lin Hua and Dennis Baldocchi and Youngryel Ryu and John Grace,0,,,,,,Does surface temperature decrease with ecosystem development?
