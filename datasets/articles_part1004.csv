1004000,"MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that recognize and bind to partially complementary sites in the 3′ untranslated regions of target genes in animals and, by unknown mechanisms, regulate protein production of the target transcript 1, 2, 3. Different combinations of microRNAs are expressed in different cell types and may coordinately regulate cell-specific target genes. Here, we present PicTar, a computational method for identifying common targets of microRNAs. Statistical tests using genome-wide alignments of eight vertebrate genomes, PicTar's ability to specifically recover published microRNA targets, and experimental validation of seven predicted targets suggest that PicTar has an excellent success rate in predicting targets for single microRNAs and for combinations of microRNAs. We find that vertebrate microRNAs target, on average, roughly 200 transcripts each.

1004001,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of non-coding RNAs that are believed to be important in many biological processes through regulation of gene expression 1, 2, 3. The precise molecular function of miRNAs in mammals is largely unknown and a better understanding will require loss-of-function studies in vivo. Here we show that a novel class of chemically engineered oligonucleotides, termed ‘antagomirs’, are efficient and specific silencers of endogenous miRNAs in mice. Intravenous administration of antagomirs against miR-16, miR-122, miR-192 and miR-194 resulted in a marked reduction of corresponding miRNA levels in liver, lung, kidney, heart, intestine, fat, skin, bone marrow, muscle, ovaries and adrenals. The silencing of endogenous miRNAs by this novel method is specific, efficient and long-lasting.

1004002,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) in animals are an enigmatic class of RNA with unknown function. To explore circRNAs systematically, we sequenced and computationally analysed human, mouse and nematode RNA. We detected thousands of well-expressed, stable circRNAs, often showing tissue/developmental-stage-specific expression. Sequence analysis indicated important regulatory functions for circRNAs. We found that a human circRNA, antisense to the cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 transcript (CDR1as), is densely bound by microRNA (miRNA) effector complexes and harbours 63 conserved binding sites for the ancient miRNA miR-7. Further analyses indicated that CDR1as functions to bind miR-7 in neuronal tissues.

1004003,"Animal microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by inhibiting translation and/or by inducing degradation of target messenger RNAs. It is unknown how much translational control is exerted by miRNAs on a genome-wide scale. We used a new proteomic approach to measure changes in synthesis of several thousand proteins in response to miRNA transfection or endogenous miRNA knockdown. In parallel, we quantified mRNA levels using microarrays. Here we show that a single miRNA can repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression is typically relatively mild. A number of known features of the miRNA-binding site such as the seed sequence also govern repression of human protein synthesis, and we report additional target sequence characteristics.

Several miRNAs in animals exhibit tissue-specific or developmental-stage-specific expression, indicating that they could play important roles in many biological processes 2, 3, 4. To study the role of miRNAs in pancreatic endocrine cells we cloned and identified a novel, evolutionarily conserved and islet-specific miRNA (miR-375). Here we show that overexpression of miR-375 suppressed glucose-induced insulin secretion, and conversely, inhibition of endogenous miR-375 function enhanced insulin secretion.

1004006,"Changes in the patterns of gene expression are widely believed to underlie many of the phenotypic differences within and between species. Although much emphasis has been placed on changes in transcriptional regulation, gene expression is regulated at many levels, all of which must ultimately be studied together to obtain a complete picture of the evolution of gene expression. Here we compare the evolution of transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional regulation that is mediated by microRNAs, a large class of small, non-coding RNAs in plants and animals, focusing on the evolution of the individual regulators and their binding sites. As an initial step towards integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, we propose a simple model that describes the transcriptional regulation of new microRNA genes.",Kevin Chen and Nikolaus Rajewsky,1551,13171679579182050363,Nature Reviews Genetics,2,93-103,Nature Publishing Group,The evolution of gene regulation by transcription factors and microRNAs,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1990,8,2007,/scholar?cites=13171679579182050363,pNfbA7EAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC

1004008,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely expressed noncoding RNAs. However, their biogenesis and possible functions are poorly understood. Here, by studying circRNAs that we identified in neuronal tissues, we provide evidence that animal circRNAs are generated cotranscriptionally and that their production rate is mainly determined by intronic sequences. We demonstrate that circularization and splicing compete against each other. These mechanisms are tissue specific and conserved in animals. Interestingly, we observed that the second exon of the splicing factor muscleblind (MBL/MBNL1) is circularized in flies and humans. This circRNA (circMbl) and its flanking introns contain conserved muscleblind binding sites, which are strongly and specifically bound by MBL. Modulation of MBL levels strongly affects circMbl biosynthesis, and this effect is dependent on the MBL binding sites.

Because experimental identification of miRNA targets is difficult, there has been an explosion of computational target predictions.

1004020,"We previously showed that type I interferon-induced, Cre-mediated ablation of surface BCR expression in mature B cells through Ig-heavy chain deletion results in apoptosis of these cells. This led to the hypothesis that survival signals from the BCR are vital for mature B cells. Here, we test two critical assumptions of this model. First, we demonstrate loss of mature B cells upon induced mutation of a signaling module of the BCR, not precluding BCR surface expression.

The identification and characterization of miRNA targets is thus a fundamental problem in biology. miRNAs regulate target genes by binding to 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of target mRNAs, and multiple binding sites for the same miRNA in 3′UTRs can strongly enhance the degree of regulation. Recent experiments have demonstrated that a large fraction of miRNA binding sites reside in coding sequences. Overall, miRNA binding sites in coding regions were shown to mediate smaller regulation than 3′UTR binding. However, possible interactions between target sites in coding sequences and 3′UTRs have not been studied. Using transcriptomics and proteomics data of ten miRNA mis-expression experiments as well as transcriptome-wide experimentally identified miRNA target sites, we found that mRNA and protein expression of genes containing target sites both in coding regions and 3′UTRs were in general mildly but significantly more regulated than those containing target sites in 3′UTRs only.

1004039,"While somatic antibody mutants are rare in the preimmune repertoire and in primary immune responses, they dominate secondary and hyperimmune responses. We present evidence that somatic hypermutation is restricted to a particular pathway of B-cell differentiation in which distinct sets of B-cell clones are driven into the memory compartment. In accord with earlier results of McKean et al.(1984) and Rudikoff et al.(1984), somatic mutation occurs stepwise in the course of clonal expansion, before and after isotype switch, presumably at a rate close to 1 X 10 (-3) per base pair per generation. At this rate, both selectable and unselectable mutations accumulate in the rearranged V region genes. The distribution of replacement mutations in the V regions shows that a fraction of the mutations in CDRs is positively selected whereas replacement mutations are counterselected in the FRs. By constructing an antibody mutant through site-specific mutagenesis we show that a point mutation in CDR1 of the heavy chain, found in most secondary anti-NP antibodies, is sufficient to increase NP binding affinity to the level typical for the secondary response. Somatic mutation may contribute to the immune repertoire in a more general sense than merely the diversification of a specific response. We have evidence that clones producing antibodies which no longer bind the immunizing antigen can be kept in the system and remain available for stimulation by a different antigen.

1004040,"The segmentation gene network of Drosophila consists of maternal and zygotic factors that generate, by transcriptional (cross-) regulation, expression patterns of increasing complexity along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Using known binding site information for maternal and zygotic gap transcription factors, the computer algorithm Ahab recovers known segmentation control elements (modules) with excellent success and predicts many novel modules within the network and genome-wide. We show that novel module predictions are highly enriched in the network and typically clustered proximal to the promoter, not only upstream, but also in intronic space and downstream. When placed upstream of a reporter gene, they consistently drive patterned blastoderm expression, in most cases faithfully producing one or more pattern elements of the endogenous gene. Moreover, we demonstrate for the entire set of known and newly validated modules that Ahab's prediction of binding sites correlates well with the expression patterns produced by the modules, revealing basic rules governing their composition.

In total, the expression of 332 intestinal miRNAs was discovered, of which 201 represented assumed novel porcine miRNAs. The identified hairpin forming precursors were in part organized in genomic clusters, and most of the precursors were located on chromosomes 3 and 1, respectively. Hierarchical clustering of the expression data revealed subsets of miRNAs that are specific to distinct parts of the intestine pointing to their impact on cellular signaling networks.

1004079,"The Lupus autoantigen La is an RNA-binding protein that stabilizes RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcripts and supports RNA folding and has in addition been implicated in the mammalian microRNA (miRNA) pathway. Here, we have analyzed effects of La depletion on Argonaute (Ago)-bound small RNAs in human cells. We find that in the absence of La, distinct tRNA fragments are loaded into Ago proteins. Thus, La functions as gatekeeper ensuring correct tRNA maturation and protecting the miRNA pathway from potentially functional tRNA fragments. However, one specific isoleucin pre-tRNA produces both a functional tRNA and a miRNA even when La is present.

1004100,"The development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms relies on gene regulation within individual constituent cells. Gene regulatory circuits that increase the robustness of gene expression frequently incorporate microRNAs as post-transcriptional regulators. Computational approaches, synthetic gene circuits and observations in model organisms predict that the co-regulation of microRNAs and their target mRNAs can reduce cell-to-cell variability in the expression of target genes. However, whether microRNAs directly regulate variability of endogenous gene expression remains to be tested in mammalian cells. Here we use quantitative flow cytometry to show that microRNAs impact on cell-to-cell variability of protein expression in developing mouse thymocytes. We find two distinct mechanisms that control variation in the activation-induced expression of the microRNA target CD69. First, the expression of miR-17 and miR-20a, two members of the miR-17-92 cluster, is co-regulated with the target mRNA Cd69 to form an activation-induced incoherent feed-forward loop. Another microRNA, miR-181a, acts at least in part upstream of the target mRNA Cd69 to modulate cellular responses to activation. The ability of microRNAs to render gene expression more uniform across mammalian cell populations may be important for normal development and for disease.",Rory Blevins and Ludovica Bruno and Thomas Carroll and James Elliott and Antoine Marcais and Christina Loh and Arnulf Hertweck and Azra Krek and Nikolaus Rajewsky and Chang-Zheng Chen and Amanda G Fisher and Matthias Merkenschlager,24,3043848862442170793,PLoS Genet,2,e1005020,Public Library of Science,microRNAs regulate cell-to-cell variability of endogenous target gene expression in developing mouse thymocytes,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005020,11,2015,/scholar?cites=3043848862442170793,pNfbA7EAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC

1004101,"Post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are of fundamental importance to form robust genetic networks, but their roles in stem cell pluripotency remain poorly understood. Here, we use freshwater planarians as a model system to investigate this and uncover a role for CCR4-NOT mediated deadenylation of mRNAs in stem cell differentiation. Planarian adult stem cells, the so-called neoblasts, drive the almost unlimited regenerative capabilities of planarians and allow their ongoing homeostatic tissue turnover. While many genes have been demonstrated to be required for these processes, currently almost no mechanistic insight is available into their regulation. We show that knockdown of planarian Not1, the CCR4-NOT deadenylating complex scaffolding subunit, abrogates regeneration and normal homeostasis. This abrogation is primarily due to severe impairment of their differentiation potential. We describe a stem cell specific increase in the mRNA levels of key neoblast genes after Smed-not1 knock down, consistent with a role of the CCR4-NOT complex in degradation of neoblast mRNAs upon the onset of differentiation. We also observe a stem cell specific increase in the frequency of longer poly(A) tails in these same mRNAs, showing that stem cells after Smed-not1 knock down fail to differentiate as they accumulate populations of transcripts with longer poly(A) tails. As other transcripts are unaffected our data hint at a targeted regulation of these key stem cell mRNAs by post-transcriptional regulators such as RNA-binding proteins or microRNAs.

We provide gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in three human cell lines (H1299, Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells), using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. Small RNA profiling showed strong expression of the immunity and inflammation-associated microRNA miRNA-155 upon infection with both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 elicited approximately two-fold higher stimulation of the interferon response compared to SARS-CoV in the permissive human epithelial cell line Calu-3, and induction of cytokines such as CXCL10 or IL6. Single cell RNA sequencing data showed that canonical interferon stimulated genes such as IFIT2 or OAS2 were broadly induced, whereas interferon beta (IFNB1) and lambda (IFNL1-4) were expressed only in a subset of infected cells. In addition, temporal resolution of transcriptional responses suggested interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) activities precede that of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB).

The protocol can be adapted to circRNAs that coexist with overlapping, noncircular mRNA isoforms produced from the same genetic locus.",Christine Kocks and Anastasiya Boltengagen and Monika Piwecka and Agnieszka Rybak-Wolf and Nikolaus Rajewsky,10,12270292698139647530,,,77-96,"Humana Press, New York, NY",Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of circular RNA CDR1as,https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7562-4_7,,2018,/scholar?cites=12270292698139647530,pNfbA7EAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC

1004119,"The Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) sandpile model is a cellular automaton which has been intensively studied during the last years as a paradigm for self-organized criticality. In this paper, we reconsider a deterministic version of the BTW model introduced by Wiesenfeld, Theiler and McNamara, where sand grains are added always to one fixed site on the square lattice. Using the Abelian sandpile formalism we discuss the static properties of the system.

1004120,"Collecting ducts make up the distal-most tubular segments of the kidney, extending from the cortex, where they connect to the nephron proper, into the medulla, where they release urine into the renal pelvis. During water deprivation, body water preservation is ensured by the selective transepithelial reabsorption of water into the hypertonic medullary interstitium mediated by collecting ducts. The collecting duct epithelium forms tight junctions composed of barrier-enforcing claudins and exhibits a higher transepithelial resistance than other segments of the renal tubule exhibit. However, the functional relevance of this strong collecting duct epithelial barrier is unresolved. Here, we report that collecting duct–specific deletion of an epithelial transcription factor, grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2), in mice led to reduced expression of tight junction–associated barrier components, reduced collecting duct transepithelial resistance …",Christian Hinze and Janett Ruffert and Katharina Walentin and Nina Himmerkus and Elham Nikpey and Olav Tenstad and Helge Wiig and Kerim Mutig and Zeliha Yesim Yurtdas and Janet D Klein and Jeff M Sands and Federica Branchi and Michael Schumann and Sebastian Bachmann and Markus Bleich and Kai M Schmidt-Ott,8,7967109348204757648,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology,3,857-868,American Society of Nephrology,GRHL2 is required for collecting duct epithelial barrier function and renal osmoregulation,https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/29/3/857?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=J_Am_Soc_Nephrol_TrendMD_0,29,2018,/scholar?cites=7967109348204757648,pNfbA7EAAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C

While patient-derived samples provide valuable insight, they are heterogeneous on multiple molecular levels, and often originate from advanced tumor stages.

1004123,"Massively multiplexed sequencing of RNA in individual cells is transforming basic and clinical life sciences. However, in standard experiments, tissues must first be dissociated. Thus, after sequencing, information about the spatial relationships between cells is lost although this knowledge is crucial for understanding cellular and tissue-level function. Recent attempts to overcome this fundamental challenge rely on employing additional in situ gene expression imaging data which can guide spatial mapping of sequenced cells. Here we present a conceptually different approach that allows to reconstruct spatial positions of cells in a variety of tissues without using reference imaging data. We first show for several complex biological systems that distances of single cells in expression space monotonically increase with their physical distances across tissues. We therefore seek to map cells to tissue space such that this principle is optimally preserved, while matching existing imaging data when available. We show that this optimization problem can be cast as a generalized optimal transport problem and solved efficiently. We apply our approach successfully to reconstruct the mammalian liver and intestinal epithelium as well as fly and zebrafish embryos. Our results demonstrate a simple spatial expression organization principle and that this principle (or future refined principles) can be used to infer, for individual cells, meaningful spatial position probabilities from the sequencing data alone.",Mor Nitzan and Nikos Karaiskos and Nir Friedman and Nikolaus Rajewsky,7,12224109266580855058,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,Charting a tissue from single-cell transcriptomes,https://edoc.mdc-berlin.de/17929/,,2018,/scholar?cites=12224109266580855058,pNfbA7EAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C

However, methods for reliable de-novo identification of proteins binding to a particular RNA are scarce and were thus far only successfully applied to abundant noncoding RNAs in cell culture. Here, we present vIPR, an RNA-protein crosslink, RNA pulldown, and shotgun proteomics approach to identify proteins bound to selected mRNAs in C. elegans. Applying vIPR to the germline-specific transcript gld-1 led to enrichment of known and novel interactors. By comparing enrichment upon gld-1 and lin-41 pulldown, we demonstrate that vIPR recovers both common and specific RNA-binding proteins, and we validate DAZ-1 as a specific gld-1 regulator.

1004128,"Mutations in the mitochondrial complex IV assembly factor SURF1 represent a major cause of Leigh syndrome (LS), a rare fatal neurological disorder. SURF1-deficient animals have failed to recapitulate the neuronal pathology of human LS, hindering our understanding of the disease mechanisms. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells from LS patients carrying homozygous SURF1 mutations (SURF1 iPS) and performed biallelic correction via CRISPR/Cas9. In contrast to corrected cells, SURF1 iPS showed impaired neuronal differentiation. Aberrant bioenergetics in SURF1 iPS occurred already in neural progenitor cells (NPCs), disrupting their neurogenic potency. Cerebral organoids from SURF1 iPS were smaller and recapitulated the neurogenesis defects. Our data imply that SURF1 mutations cause a failure in the development of maturing neurons.

1004129,"MicroRNAs appear to be involved in nearly all biological processes, as the large majority of protein coding genes are assumed to be regulated by one or several miRNAs. To exert their repressive function on translation and transcript stability, miRNAs guide Argonaute (AGO) proteins to partially complementary sites in target RNAs. A short hexamer of the miRNAs, called the seed, is especially involved in target binding and complementarity to the seed can be used to predict targets of miRNAs, albeit with considerable number of false predictions. Several biochemical methods have been developed to identify miRNA targets, amongst others crosslinking and immunoprecipitation approaches. These identify target sites at nucleotide resolution and can also directly tell which miRNA is binding, when the data is analyzed for miRNA:target site ligation products.This chapter will give an overview on the mechanism by which …",Stefanie Grosswendt and Nikolaus Rajewsky,5,6520994439932848095,,,19-38,Academic Press,"Essentials of miRNA-dependent control of mRNA translation and decay, miRNA targeting principles, and methods for target identification",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128044025000029,,2017,/scholar?cites=6520994439932848095,pNfbA7EAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C

1004135,"Next-generation sequencing has uncovered novel classes of small RNAs (sRNAs) in eukaryotes, in addition to the well-known miRNAs, siRNAs, and piRNAs. In particular, sRNA species arise from transcription start sites (TSSs) and the transcription termination sites (TTSs) of genes. However, a detailed characterization of these new classes of sRNAs is still lacking. Here, we present a comprehensive study of sRNAs derived from TTSs of expressed genes (TTSa-RNAs) in human cell lines and primary tissues. Taking advantage of sRNA-sequencing, we show that TTSa-RNAs are present in the nuclei of human cells, are loaded onto both AGO1 and AGO2, and their biogenesis does not require DICER and AGO2 endonucleolytic activity. TTSa-RNAs display a strong bias against a G residue in the first position at 5 end, a known feature of AGO-bound sRNAs, and a peculiar oligoA tail at 3 end. AGO-bound TTSa-RNAs derive from genes involved in cell cycle progression regulation and DNA integrity checkpoints. Finally, we provide evidence that TTSa-RNAs can be detected by sRNA-Seq in primary human tissue, and their expression increases in tumor samples as compared to nontumor tissues, suggesting that in the future, TTSa-RNAs might be explored as biomarker for diagnosis or prognosis of human malignancies.",Ilaria Laudadio and Sara Formichetti and Silvia Gioiosa and Filippos Klironomos and Nikolaus Rajewsky and Giuseppe Macino and Claudia Carissimi and Valerio Fulci,3,11260913557404846976,International journal of genomics,,,Hindawi,"Characterization of transcription termination-associated RNAs: new insights into their biogenesis, tailing, and expression in primary tumors",https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijg/2018/1243858/abs/,2018,2018,/scholar?cites=11260913557404846976,pNfbA7EAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC

1004136,"Translation of a message into a protein can be initiated when the 43S complex, while scanning the message from 5′ to 3′, encounters an initiation codon. Recently, it has become clear that metazoan mRNAs very often contain small ORFs upstream of the main start codon (uORFs)[1]. For example, almost half of mammalian mRNAs contain uORFs, which are also frequently translated as suggested by ribosomal footprinting data [2]. Overall, uORFs currently emerge as key elements of translational control mechanisms, and are implicated in a growing number of human diseases [3]. What is the specific impact of uORFs on translation? Generally, uORFs are thought to repress translation of the main message by sequestering initiation events. However, since the 1980s it has been thought that after termination, the 40S ribosomal subunit can remain bound to the mRNA and re-initiate at a downstream ORF.

CircRNAs are tissue-specific and have been implicated in diseases including cancer. They can function as sponges for microRNAs (miRNAs) or RNA binding proteins (RBPs), for example. Moreover, some contain open reading frames (ORFs) and might be translated. The functional relevance of such peptides, however, remains largely elusive. Here, we report that the ORF of circZNF609 is efficiently translated when expressed from a circZNF609 overexpression construct. However, endogenous proteins could not be detected.

We detected, at near single-cell resolution, > 10,000 mRNAs, > 300 miRNAs and numerous novel miRNAs. Most RNAs were organized in distinct spatial patterns. Germline-specific miRNAs and their targets were co-localized. Moreover, we observed differential 3’ UTR isoform usage for hundreds of mRNAs. In tumorous gld-2 gld-1 mutants, gene expression was strongly perturbed. In particular, differential 3’ UTR usage was significantly impaired.

1004140,"Single-cell RNA-seq technologies are rapidly evolving but while very informative, in standard scRNAseq experiments the spatial organization of the cells in the tissue of origin is lost. Conversely, spatial RNA-seq technologies designed to keep the localization of the cells have limited throughput and gene coverage. Mapping scRNAseq to genes with spatial information increases coverage while providing spatial location. However, methods to perform such mapping have not yet been benchmarked. To bridge the gap, we organized the DREAM Single-Cell Transcriptomics challenge focused on the spatial reconstruction of cells from the Drosophila embryo from scRNAseq data, leveraging as gold standard genes with in situ hybridization data from the Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project reference atlas. The 34 participating teams used diverse algorithms for gene selection and location prediction, while being able to correctly localize rare subpopulations of cells.

1004141,"Herpesvirus infection initiates a range of perturbations in the host cell, which remain poorly understood at the level of individual cells. Here, we quantified the transcrips of single human primary fibroblasts during the first hours of lytic infection with HSV-1. By applying a generalizable analysis scheme, we defined a precise temporal order of early viral gene expression and found unexpected bifurcations and bottlenecks. We identified individual host cell genes and pathways relevant in early infection by combining three different computational approaches: gene and pathway overdispersion analysis, prediction of cell-state transition probabilities as well as future cell states.

Although proteins are the final product of most genes, the developmental proteome of an animal has not yet been comprehensively defined, and the correlation between mRNA and protein abundance during development is largely unknown. Here, we globally measured and compared protein and mRNA expression changes during the life cycle of the nematodes C. elegans and C. briggsae, separated by $30 million years of evolution. We observed that developmental mRNA and protein changes were highly conserved to a surprisingly similar degree but were poorly correlated within a species, suggesting important and widespread posttranscriptional regulation. Posttranscriptional control was particularly well conserved if mRNA fold changes were buffered on the protein level, indicating a predominant repressive function.

1004145,"Upon activation by antigen, T lymphocytes switch from a resting state to clonal expansion. This switch requires inactivation of the forkhead transcription factor Foxo1, which suppresses proliferation in resting T helper lymphocytes. In the initial antigen-dependent phase of clonal expansion, Foxo1 is inactivated by antigen receptor-dependent post-translational modifications. However, the late antigen-independent phase of clonal expansion is controlled by interleukin 2 (IL2), and it has not been clear how Foxo1 is inactivated in this phase. Here the authors show that in the IL2-dependent late phase of clonal expansion, expression of Foxo1 is downregulated by microRNA-182. Expression of microRNA-182 in activated T lymphocytes is induced by IL2. MicroRNA-182 is expressed between 2 and 4 days after onset of T cell activation.

Traditional reporter assays inform about function of individual regulatory elements, typically in isolation. However, regulatory elements must ultimately be understood by perturbing them within their genomic environment and developmental- or tissue-specific contexts. This is technically challenging; therefore, few regulatory elements have been characterized in vivo. Here, we used inducible Cas9 and multiplexed guide RNAs to create hundreds of mutations in enhancers/promoters and 3′ UTRs of 16 genes in C. elegans. To quantify the consequences of mutations on expression, we developed a targeted RNA sequencing strategy across hundreds of mutant animals.

1004161,"Posttranscriptional gene regulation is important for all stages of the life of a (messenger) RNA molecule, including splicing, nuclear/cytoplasmic export/import, transcript stability, as well as subcellular localization and translation (Martin and Ephrussi, 2009; Moore and Proudfoot, 2009; Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009). The factors that mediate these regulatory processes are RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). In humans, more than 800 RBPs (Baltz et al., 2012; Castello et al., 2012) stably bind to single-stranded RNA sequences or to RNA secondary structures, and either affect the transcript directly, eg, by stabilizing or cleaving it, or indirectly, by recruiting or preventing the association of other factors. ncRNAs, which are not translated into proteins, include diverse groups of RNAs, like small regulatory RNAs (microRNAs, piRNAs, etc.), long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs)(reviewed in Cech and Steitz, 2014). They often function in conjunction with RBPs in so-called ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs). An example hereof is the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Its core component Argonaute is bound to a microRNA that guides the complex to its target RNAs to mediate repression of protein production.Initially discovered in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Lee et al., 1993; Wightman et al., 1993; Reinhart et al., 2000), miRNAs were found to form a large group of small RNAs in animals and plants, with some miRNAs being deeply conserved (Pasquinelli et al., 2000; Ibanez-Ventoso et al., 2008).

We expand our published method and predict conserved sORFs in human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly and the nematode C. elegans. Isolating specific conservation signatures indicative of purifying selection on encoded amino acid sequence, we identify about 2000 novel sORFs in the untranslated regions of canonical mRNAs or on transcripts annotated as non-coding. Predicted sORFs show stronger conservation signatures than those identified in previous studies and are sometimes conserved over large evolutionary distances. Encoded peptides have little homology to known proteins and are enriched in disordered regions and short interaction motifs. Published ribosome profiling data indicate translation for more than 100 of novel sORFs, and mass spectrometry data gives peptidomic evidence for more than 70 novel candidates.

Although planaria emerged as an attractive in vivo model system for stem cell biology, gene expression in neoblasts has not been profiled comprehensively and it is unknown how molecular mechanisms for pluripotency in neoblasts relate to those in mammalian embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We purified neoblasts and quantified mRNA and protein expression by sequencing and shotgun proteomics. We identified∼ 4000 genes specifically expressed in neoblasts, including all∼ 30 known neoblast markers. Genes important for pluripotency in ESCs, including regulators as well as targets of OCT4, were well conserved and upregulated in neoblasts. We found conserved expression of epigenetic regulators and demonstrated their requirement for planarian regeneration by knockdown experiments. Post-transcriptional regulatory genes characteristic for germ cells were also enriched in neoblasts, suggesting the existence of a common ancestral state of germ cells and ESCs.

1004180,"Small regulatory RNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that function primarily as negative regulators of other RNA transcripts. The principal members of this class are microRNAs and siRNAs, which are involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing. These small RNAs, which in their functional form are singlestranded and~ 22 nucleotides in length, guide a gene silencing complex to an mRNA by complementary base pairing, mostly at the 3’untranslated region (3’UTR) 1, 2. The association of the silencing complex to the conjugate mRNA results in silencing the gene either by translational repression or by degradation of the mRNA. The discovery of microRNAs and their regulatory mechanism has been at the center of a dogmatic shift of our view of non-coding RNAs and their biological role.In recent years, microRNAs have emerged as a major class of regulatory genes central to a wide range of cellular activities, including stem cell maintenance, developmental timing, metabolism, host-viral interaction, apoptosis and neuronal gene expression and muscle proliferation3. Consequently, changes in the expression, sequence or target sites of microRNA are associated with a number of human genetic diseases4. Indeed, microRNAs are known to act both as tumor suppressors and oncogenes, and aberrant expression of microRNAs is associated with progression of cancer5.

1004186,"Recently, it has been discovered that the genomes of animals contain hundreds of microRNA genes. These small noncoding genes are typically transcribed by RNA polymerase II, processed into hairpins, and exported into the cytoplasm, where they are cleaved by the central enzyme of the RNAi pathway, Dicer, to form single-stranded mature microRNAs [1, 2]. In animals, mature microRNAs are thought to bind to partially complementary binding sites in the mRNAs of target genes and, by unknown mechanisms, to regulate their posttranscriptional expression. In all known cases microRNAs repress expression of protein-coding target genes, either by repressing translation while not affecting the mRNA concentration of the target, or potentially by directly inducing a decrease in target mRNA concentrations [3]. To understand the biological function of microRNAs it is therefore important to identify their targets. Since high-throughput experimental methods for microRNA target identification have not been published yet, computational methods that try to identify target sites based on their partial complementarity with microRNAs have become increasingly important [4–13]. In flies, the sensitivity of these methods was sufficient to predict roughly eight targets per microRNA above noise, although the true number of targets has been estimated to be much higher [14]. Cross-species comparisons, which allow for the identification of evolutionarily conserved and thus likely functional target sites, have proven very helpful to boost the sensitivity of microRNA target detection.

1004188,"Posttranscriptional gene regulation is important for all stages of the life of a (messenger) RNA molecule, including splicing, nuclear/cytoplasmic export/import, transcript stability, as well as subcellular localization and translation (Martin and Ephrussi, 2009; Moore and Proudfoot, 2009; Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009). The factors that mediate these regulatory processes are RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). In humans, more than 800 RBPs (Baltz et al., 2012; Castello et al., 2012) stably bind to single-stranded RNA sequences or to RNA secondary structures, and either affect the transcript directly, eg, by stabilizing or cleaving it, or indirectly, by recruiting or preventing the association of other factors. ncRNAs, which are not translated into proteins, include diverse groups of RNAs, like small regulatory RNAs (microRNAs, piRNAs, etc.), long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs)(reviewed in Cech and Steitz, 2014). They often function in conjunction with RBPs in so-called ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs). An example hereof is the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Its core component Argonaute is bound to a microRNA that guides the complex to its target RNAs to mediate repression of protein production.Initially discovered in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Lee et al., 1993; Wightman et al., 1993; Reinhart et al., 2000), miRNAs were found to form a large group of small RNAs in animals and plants, with some miRNAs being deeply conserved (Pasquinelli et al., 2000; Ibánez-Ventoso et al., 2008).

1004191,"BackgroundMammalian preimplantation development is the process of converting a fertilized zygote into an implantation-ready blastocyst. Over a span of 3 to 4 days in the mouse, the embryo undergoes a series of cleavage divisions, inner-outer cell positioning, and cavity expansion to produce a blastocyst with two distinct and well-specified lineages–an outer trophectoderm (TE) layer and an inner cell mass (ICM). Common pathways known to be involved in TE-ICM fate specification of the preimplantation embryo include Hippo and Notch signalling, which can differentially regulate TE-and ICM-specific transcription factors in outer and inner cells, respectively 1.",Ana Miar and Esther Arnaiz and Esther Bridges and Shaunna Beedie and Adam P Cribbs and Damien J Downes and Robert Beagrie and Jan Rehwinkel and Adrian L Harris,0,,,,,,"Preprint highlights, selected by the biological community",http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9017740708015425954&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,pNfbA7EAAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC

The late Roger Tsien then used the original AvGFP in 1994 to evolve the GFP protein tag which would revolutionize biological imaging 4. Today, the majority of commonly used fluorescent proteins (FP) is still derived from this original AvGFP, as the protein lineage tree on FPBase. org beautifully illustrates (fpbase. org/protein/avgfp/) 1, 5.

1004200,"A key question in development is how spatial distribution of RNAs shapes cell proliferation and differentiation. We address this question using the Caenorhabditis elegans germline as a powerful in vivo model. The basic molecular architecture of the C. elegans germline is similar to that of higher organisms (Nousch et al. 2015). However, despite many studies, the spatially resolved molecular makeup of the germline is largely unknown. To investigate the spatial distribution of RNAs we applied a new cryo-cut based method (Junker et al. Cell 2014) that allows spatially resolved transcriptomics at the scale of single cells. We extracted the germline and dissected it into at least 15 different sections. After RNA extraction from the individual sections, in vitro transcription for linear amplification of cDNA and high-throughput sequencing, we identify candidate genes expressed in specific patterns.

Mass fragmentation pathways of flavones glycosides in ECT HR-MS was used to provide accurate mass values for the precursor and the fragment ions of quinochalcone C-glycosides, flavonoid glycosides, and flavanone glycosides, and their fragmentation pathways were summarized according to the results obtained from the reference compounds, and from the compounds contained in the ECT.1.1 Quinochalcone C-glycosides The quinochalcone C-glycosides contained in ECT have the same quinochalcone skeleton, along with a hydroxyl group, and a C-glucosyl group at the C-5′ position. Overall, the characteristic fragmentation of these compounds primarily occurred at the C-C bond between the skeleton and the glucosyl group. In contrast to the typical cross-ring cleavage at the sugar moiety of other C-glycosyl flavonoids, these quinochalcone C-glycosides yielded a prominent fragment ion of [M–H–Glc]-under the negative ionization, attributing to the neutral loss of the C-5′ glucosyl group. In addition, the [M–H–Glc–H2O–CO]-and [M–H–Glc–H2O–CO–C4H8O4]-ions were observed as the other major fragment ions, along with the [M–H–C4H8O4]-ion, which was proved to be the characteristic 0, 2X ion of the C-glycosyl flavonoids 1.
