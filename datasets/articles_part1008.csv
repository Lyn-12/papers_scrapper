1008010,"To identify new susceptibility loci for psoriasis, we undertook a genome-wide association study of 594,224 SNPs in 2,622 individuals with psoriasis and 5,667 controls. We identified associations at eight previously unreported genomic loci. Seven loci harbored genes with recognized immune functions (IL28RA, REL, IFIH1, ERAP1, TRAF3IP2, NFKBIA and TYK2). These associations were replicated in 9,079 European samples (six loci with a combined P< 5× 10− 8 and two loci with a combined P< 5× 10− 7).

The largest gain in adult height over the past century has occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (95% credible interval 17.5–22.7) and 16.5 cm (13.3–19.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over these 100 years are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of 20th century, whose average heights surpassed 182.5 cm, and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 (140.3 cm; 135.8–144.8).

Methods and Findings We genotyped three tagging SNPs (CRP + 2302G > A; CRP + 1444T > C; CRP + 4899T > G) in the CRP gene and measured serum CRP in 5,274 men and women at mean ages 49 and 61 y (Whitehall II Study).

1008062,"Background Ischaemic stroke in persons of European descent has a genetic basis, but whether the stroke-susceptibility alleles, the strength of any association, and the extent of their attributable risks are the same in persons of non-European descent remains unanswered. Whether ethnicity itself has a relevant or substantial contribution on those effect estimates is controversial. Comparative analyses between the ethnic groups may allow general conclusions to be drawn about polygenic disorders.   Methods and Findings We performed a literature-based systematic review of genetic association studies in stroke in persons of non-European descent. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined for each gene–disease association using fixed and random effect models. We further performed a comparative genetic analysis across the different ethnic groups (including persons of European descent derived from our previous meta-analysis) to determine if genetic risks varied by ethnicity. Following a review of 500 manuscripts, eight candidate gene variants were analysed among 32,431 individuals (12,883 cases and 19,548 controls), comprising mainly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean individuals. Of the eight candidate genes studied, three were associated with ischaemic stroke: the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism with a mean OR of 1.90 (95% CI 1.23–2.93) in the Chinese and 1.74 (95% CI 0.88–3.42) in the Japanese; the summary OR for the C677T variant of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) was 1.18 (95% CI 0.90–1.56) in Chinese and 1.34 (95% CI 0.87–2.06 …",Roshan Ariyaratnam and Juan P Casas and John Whittaker and Liam Smeeth and Aroon D Hingorani and Pankaj Sharma,147,4316329986584885840,PLoS Med,4,e131,Public Library of Science,"Genetics of ischaemic stroke among persons of non-European descent: a meta-analysis of eight genes involving∼ 32,500 individuals",https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040131,4,2007,/scholar?cites=4316329986584885840,Ey8XGUgAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C

We propose that inappropriate diet and inadequate sanitary infrastructure may act as triggers to create an imbalance between nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O–2). An increase in the concentrations of oxidizedLDL produces both decreased NO and increased O–2 endothelial synthesis, by accumulation of asymmetrical NG-NG-dimethyl-L-arginine, the endogenous inhibitor of NO, and by activation of NAD(P)H oxidase. On the other hand, high rates of chronic infection-inflammation, due to inappropriate sanitary environment stimulate higher circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines.

An insertion/deletion polymorphism within the angiotensin-I converting enzyme gene (ACE-I/D) has shown to be reliably associated with differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. However, previous studies of the ACE-I/D variant and preeclampsia have been individually underpowered to detect plausible genotypic risks.   Methods and Findings A prospective case-control study was conducted in 1,711 unrelated young pregnant women (665 preeclamptic and 1,046 healthy pregnant controls) recruited from five Colombian cities. Maternal blood was obtained to genotype for the ACE-I/D polymorphism. Crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using logistic regression models were obtained to evaluate the strength of the association between ACE-I/D variant and preeclampsia risk. A meta-analysis was then undertaken of all published studies to February 2006 evaluating the ACE-I/D variant in preeclampsia. An additive model (per-D-allele) revealed a null association between the ACE-I/D variant and preeclampsia risk (crude OR = 0.95 [95% CI, 0.81–1.10]) in the new case-control study. Similar results were obtained after adjusting for confounders (adjusted per-allele OR = 0.90 [95% CI, 0.77–1.06]) and using other genetic models of inheritance.

1008143," Background: Mendelian randomization studies have so far restricted attention to linear associations relating the genetic instrument to the exposure, and the exposure to the outcome. In some cases, however, observational data suggest a non-linear association between exposure and outcome. For example, alcohol consumption is consistently reported as having a U-shaped association with cardiovascular events.

1008153,"Genome-wide association studies have identified a wealth of genetic variants involved in complex traits and multifactorial diseases. There is now considerable interest in testing variants for association with multiple phenotypes (pleiotropy) and for testing multiple variants for association with a single phenotype (gene-based association tests). Such approaches can increase statistical power by combining evidence for association over multiple phenotypes or genetic variants respectively. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) measures the correlation between two sets of multidimensional variables, and thus offers the potential to combine these two approaches. To apply CCA, we must restrict the number of attributes relative to the number of samples. Hence we consider modules of genetic variation that can comprise a gene, a pathway or another biologically relevant grouping, and/or a set of phenotypes. In order to do this, we use an attribute selection strategy based on a binary genetic algorithm. Applied to a UK-based prospective cohort study of 4286 women (the British Women's Heart and Health Study), we find improved statistical power in the detection of previously reported genetic associations, and identify a number of novel pleiotropic associations between genetic variants and phenotypes.

However, the relationship of circulating ApoE concentration and CVD has received little attention.   Methods and Findings To address this, we measured circulating ApoE concentration in 9,587 individuals (with 1,413 CVD events) from three studies with incident CVD events: two population-based studies, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the men-only Northwick Park Heart Study II (NPHSII), and a nested sub-study of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT). We examined the association of circulating ApoE with cardiovascular risk factors in the two population-based studies (ELSA and NPHSII) and the relationship between ApoE concentration and coronary heart disease and stroke in all three studies. Analyses were carried out within study, and, where appropriate, pooled effect estimates were derived using meta-analysis.

We investigate the association of area deprivation, using Index of Multiple deprivation (IMD), with overall and cause-specific mortality, contextualising findings within a systematic review.   Methods And FindingsWe used data from 4,286 women from the British Women’s Heart Health Study (BWHHS) recruited at 1999-2001 to examine the association of IMD with overall and cause-specific mortality using Cox regression models. One standard deviation (SD) increase in the IMD score had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.21 (95% CI: 1.13-1.30) for overall mortality after adjustment for age and lifecourse individual deprivation, which was attenuated to 1.15 (95% CI: 1.04-1.26) after further inclusion of mediators (health behaviours, biological factors and use of statins and blood pressure-lowering medications). A more pronounced association was observed for respiratory disease and vascular deaths. The meta-analysis, based on 20 published studies plus the BWHHS (n=21), yielded a summary relative risk (RR) of 1.15 (95% CI: 1.11-1.19) for area deprivation (top [least deprived; reference] vs. bottom tertile) with overall mortality in an age and sex adjusted model, which reduced to 1.06 (95% CI: 1.04-1.08) in a fully adjusted model.

Deviations from the physiological ranges are usually a sign of disease, although variation between healthy individuals also occurs, at least partly due to genetic factors. Recent large scale genetic studies identified loci associated with one or more of these traits; further characterization of known loci and identification of new loci is necessary to better understand their role in health and disease and to identify potential molecular mechanisms. We performed meta-analysis of Metabochip association results for six RBC traits—hemoglobin concentration (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and red blood cell count (RCC)—in 11 093 Europeans from seven studies of the UCL-LSHTM-Edinburgh-Bristol (UCLEB) Consortium.

1008217,"Lack of efficacy in the intended disease indication is the major cause of clinical phase drug development failure. Explanations could include the poor external validity of pre-clinical (cell, tissue, and animal) models of human disease and the high false discovery rate (FDR) in preclinical science.

1008222,"Background Maternal serum concentrations of folate, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 have been associated with pre-eclampsia. Nevertheless, reported studies involve limited number of cases to reliably assess the nature of these associations. Our aim was to examine the relation of these three biomarkers with pre-eclampsia risk in a large Colombian population.   Materials and methods Design: A case-control study. Setting: Cases of pre-eclampsia and healthy pregnant controls were recruited at the time of delivery from eight different Colombian cities between 2000 and 2012. Population or Sample: 2978 cases and 4096 controls were studied. Maternal serum concentrations of folate, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 were determined in 1148 (43.6%) cases and 1300 (31.7%) controls. Also, self-reported folic acid supplementation was recorded for 2563 (84%) cases and 3155 (84%) controls. Analysis: Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for pre-eclampsia were estimated for one standard deviation (1SD) increase in log-transformed biomarkers. Furthermore, we conducted analyses to compare women that reported taking folic acid supplementation for different periods during pregnancy. Main Outcomes Measures: Odds ratio for pre-eclampsia.   Results After adjusting for potential confounders in logistic regression models, the OR for pre-eclampsia was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.90) for 1SD increase in log-folate, 1.16 (95%CI: 1.05, 1.27) for 1SD increase in log-homocysteine, and 1.10 (95%CI: 0.99, 1.22) for 1SD increase in log-vitamin B12.

1008238,"We characterised the phenotypic consequence of genetic variation at the PCSK9 locus and compared findings with recent trials of pharmacological inhibitors of PCSK9. Published and individual participant level data (300,000+ participants) were combined to construct a weighted PCSK9 gene-centric score (GS). Seventeen randomized placebo controlled PCSK9 inhibitor trials were included, providing data on 79,578 participants. Results were scaled to a one mmol/L lower LDL-C concentration. The PCSK9 GS (comprising 4 SNPs) associations with plasma lipid and apolipoprotein levels were consistent in direction with treatment effects. The GS odds ratio (OR) for myocardial infarction (MI) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.42; 0.68), compared to a PCSK9 inhibitor effect of 0.90 (95% CI 0.86; 0.93). For ischemic stroke ORs were 0.84 (95% CI 0.57; 1.22) for the GS, compared to 0.85 (95% CI 0.78; 0.93) in the drug trials. ORs with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were 1.29 (95% CI 1.11; 1.50) for the GS, as compared to 1.00 (95% CI 0.96; 1.04) for incident T2DM in PCSK9 inhibitor trials. No genetic associations were observed for cancer, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or Alzheimer’s disease – outcomes for which large-scale trial data were unavailable.

We explore the association between two measures of adiposity (BMI and WHR) with COPD in the British Women’s Heart and Health Study including a detailed assessment of the potential for confounding and reverse causality for each adiposity measure.

Women with low BMI have a detrimental profile across a broad range of health markers compared to women with low WHR, and women with low WHR do not appear to have an elevated COPD risk, lending support to the hypothesis that WHR is a less confounded measure of adiposity than BMI.

I: 27 children up to 4 years old, II: 13 children in the age range of 4-14 years. The nutritional status was evaluated by anthropometric measurement (body mass, body length/height). Moreover Cole index was estimated at the beginning and completion of the treatment and in the time of the highest weight loss. None of the examined children has body mass deficiency before IFN-alpha treatment: Cole index was in normal range as well. Lack of appetite, connected with IFN-alpha administration, was observed in 42.5 children during therapy. Weight loss was observed in 65% of the examined children especially in the first 2 months of therapy. Return to the initial body mass value was observed within 3 months after IFN-alpha completion in 77% children; but in 2 children only 12 months after IFN-alpha therapy termination. 12 months after IFN-alpha completion Cole index lower than initial was observed in 42.5% of the examined children in spite of return of body mass to initial values. There was no observed unfavourable influence of IFN treatment on body height. 20-weeks IFN-alpha therapy in children with chronic hepatitis B often causes lack of appetite, which may lead to reversible disturbances in nutritional status.

1008274,"Despite its origins in the mid-1950s with a bone adhesive called Ostamer [1], the development of bone adhesives is still in its early stages and is not a mature field. There lacks a consensus on aspects of adhesive performance and bond strength measurement. As a result, there are not standard tests for quantifying and evaluating the adhesive strength at the interface between the bone tissue and biomaterial [2-4]. The purpose of this study is to design and standardize a protocol capable of measuring the bond strength of bone adhesives. The protocol consists of mechanically evaluated different formulations of adhesives based on chitosan and alginate, selected based on their individual potential as bone adhesives [5]. Three mechanical tests were implemented. The first and second methods are tensile tests with a controlled fracture at 90º (TT90) or 45 (TT45) relative to the load direction along a constant transverse section of 10 mmx10 mm. The third test is a three point flexural test (3PFT), where the deflection of cancellous bone sheets is tested with and without adhesive reinforcement. In order to propose a methodology to apply the adhesive in bone specimens, a dental adhesive Adper Single Bond (3M Espe) was used. Finally, the results from the mechanical characterization were analyzed using ANOVA (p< 0.05) and pos hoc Tukey tests to compare the bond strength of each formulation against Kryptonite®(Doctors Research Group, Inc.,), a commercial bone cement with adhesive properties that has shown promising in vivo results and has FDA approval [6].",F Cedano and DM Tabima and F Salcedo,4,8714632214096630474,"XXIV Congress of the International Society of Biomechanics, Brazil",,,,First approach of a protocol for test bone adhesives,https://media.isbweb.org/images/conferences/isb-congresses/2013/poster/ps2-06a.pdf,,2013,/scholar?cites=8714632214096630474,Ey8XGUgAAAAJ:8uzoZH4hB9AC

1008276,"Pulmonary function tests in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis characteristically show a restrictive pattern, resulting from reduction of pulmonary compliance due to diffuse fibrosis. Conversely, an obstructive pattern with hyperinflation results in emphysema by loss of elastic recoil, expiratory collapse of the peripheral airways and air trapping. Previous reports suggest that when both diseases coexist, pulmonary volumes are compensated and a smaller than expected reduction or even normal lung volumes can be found. We report 4 male patients of 64, 60, 73 and 70 years, all with heavy cigarette smoking history and progressive breathlessness. Three of them had severe limitation in their quality of life. All four showed advanced lung interstitial involvement, at high resolution CT scan, fibrotic changes predominantly in the subpleural areas of lower lung fields and concomitant emphysema in the upper lobes. Emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis was confirmed by open lung biopsy in one patient.

1008278,"A pesar de los avances en la prevención y el tratamiento de la enfermedad coronaria, ésta sigue siendo la principal causa de morbimortalidad en el mundo occidental. En la actualidad el 10% de los pacientes sometidos a coronariografía son aquellos que persisten sintomáticos y limitados en su calidad de vida a pesar de estar máximamente tratados. Para ellos, y para los que combinan territorios revascularizables con no revascularizables, la angiogénesis terapéutica aparece como una alternativa prometedora. En sentido amplio, la angiogénesis es el proceso de neoformación vascular que ocurre durante el desarrollo embrionario y la vida extrauterina. La angiogénesis terapéutica no es más que la utilizaci ón de este proceso fisiológico intentando controlarlo en espacio, tiempo y forma. La metodología consiste en administrar los factores angiogénicos de crecimiento, o los genes que los expresan, por diversas vías (intramiocárdica, tópica, parenteral o intrapericárdica). Tanto los tipos de terapia (proteica o génica) como las vías de administraci ón tienen sus ventajas y sus desventajas. Los estudios en modelos animales de isquemia miocárdica crónica demuestran la eficacia de la angiogénesis terapéutica y los resultados de los primeros ensayos clínicos son alentadores.

1008282,"Body-mass index (BMI) has increased steadily in most countries in parallel with a rise in the proportion of the population who live in cities 1,2 . This has led to a widely reported view that urbanization is one of the most important drivers of the global rise in obesity 3–6 . Here we use 2,009 population-based studies, with measurements of height and weight in more than 112 million adults, to report national, regional and global trends in mean BMI segregated by place of residence (a rural or urban area) from 1985 to 2017. We show that, contrary to the dominant paradigm, more than 55% of the global rise in mean BMI from 1985 to 2017—and more than 80% in some low- and middle-income regions—was due to increases in BMI in rural areas. This large contribution stems from the fact that, with the exception of women in sub-Saharan Africa, BMI is increasing at the same rate or faster in rural areas than in cities in low- and middle-income regions. These trends have in turn resulted in a closing—and in some countries reversal—of the gap in BMI between urban and rural areas in low- and middle-income countries, especially for women. In high-income and industrialized countries, we noted a persistently higher rural BMI, especially for women. There is an urgent need for an integrated approach to rural nutrition that enhances financial and physical access to healthy foods, to avoid replacing the rural undernutrition disadvantage in poor countries with a more general malnutrition disadvantage that entails excessive consumption of low-quality calories. © 2019, The Author(s).",JB Jonas and AM Sibai and Y-H Khang and P Kolsteren and RJ Wilks and A Giwercman and H Bettiol and M Sorić and M Kunešová and M Rahman and D Molnár and A Yoshihara and K Widhalm and B Maire and S Mohanna and IS Santos and BS Ruiz-Betancourt and K Van Herck and G Valdivia and E Janus and A Mostafa and WMM Verschuren and M Bamoshmoosh and W Zheng and FJ Rühli and PC Gupta and E Oda and H Chen and M Zhou and T Jääskeläinen and A Ghasemian and AM Batieha and E Mirrakhimov and F AlBuhairan and S Bo and C Kelleher and M-R Jarvelin and Y Hu and Y-Y Kim and AR Dorosty and C Lachat and HTP Do and J König and D Galeone and L Palmieri and E Sonestedt and R Kaaks and J Hyska and M Punab and JS Moon and K Schindler and C Kyobutungi and SP Garnett and JM Geleijnse and I Pudule and P Elliott and T Laatikainen and RC Sylva and H Pikhart and C Erem and L Serra-Majem and AC Pereira and VE Irazola and AM Silva and G Posch and P Ordunez and R Gupta and M Scazufca and T Tello and F Chen and MW Strufaldi and J Mi and K Le Nguyen Bao and M Tsigga and I Guessous and W Ahrens and B Velika and AJ Price and IMSL Khouw and IGM van Valkengoed and S Kriemler and R Martin and A Sjöberg and N Rinaldo and E Martos and F Tchibindat and R Ramos and C Robitaille and Y Song and M Lang Morovic and A Ostovar and SC Ho and LM Boddy and V Mocanu and T Vega and J Escobedo-de la Peña and MB Snijder and A Spinelli and HB Bueno-de-Mesquita and M Visser and R Suárez-Medina and AJ Hayes and JA Staessen and RM Ritti-Dias and R Topór-Madry and MC Gulliford and Y Martin-Prevel and E Sobngwi and W Wei and V Sember and CP Boissonnet and KM Jamil and LA Simons and X Guo and E Carmuega and VM Herrera and RJ Adams and A Cucu and H Concin and TK Gill and C Burns and M Sjöström and N Mohammadifard and AA Zainuddin and T Zeljkovic Vrkic and K Nelis and A Diaz and JA Rivera and K De Ridder and M Forsner and J Breda and A Schaffrath Rosario and A Fijalkowska and JM Ibarluzea and H Ulmer and J Vaitkeviciute and P Ueda and J Stokwiszewski and R Martorell and CA Hadjigeorgiou and MB Donati and N Sarrafzadegan and M McKee and J Walton and H Poustchi and L Nelis and M Nankap and R Haghshenas and G Moschonis and E Ferrer,3,5862435815297737812,,,,Nature Research,Rising rural body-mass index is the main driver of the global obesity epidemic in adults,http://190.116.48.43/handle/upch/6895,,2019,/scholar?cites=5862435815297737812,Ey8XGUgAAAAJ:SrKkpNFED5gC

Así, se conoce que alrededor del 30% de los enfermos que inician una terapéutica hipolipemiante la abandonan con el tiempo. Además, los estudios multicéntricos ASPIRE, EUROASPIRE y ACCEPT han permitido comprobar que, a los 6 meses de un accidente coronario o de un procedimiento de revascularización, un alto porcentaje de pacientes continúa con cifras elevadas de colesterol, o persisten hipertensos, o bien siguen fumando.

1008314,"UNLABELLED: Effectiveness of non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) was prospectively evaluated in 22 selected patients with acute respiratory failure, meeting criteria for orotracheal intubation and conventional mechanical ventilation. Patients were divided in two groups: group A (17 patients) with initial PaCO2 above 45 mm Hg and group B (5 patients) with initial PaCO2 below 45 mmHg. NIPPV was administered with 2 levels of pressure either by nasal or facial mask. Respiratory rate (RR), arterial blood pH, PaCO2 and PaO2/FiO2 were registered pretreatment, 1 hour and 24 hours after NIPPV. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA test, p< 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In group A there was a reduction in RR (X+/-DS) from 31.2+/-8.2 to 24.7+/-8.2 at one hour (h)(p= 0.02) and to 23.4+/-6.5 at 24 hs (p= 0.01), pH change from 7.33+/-0.07 to 7.37+/-0.07 at one hour (p= 0.13) and to 7.40+/-0.07 at 24 hs (p= 0.01), a PaCO2 change from 69.5+/-19.6 to 57.8+/-16.9 at one hour (p= 0.06) and to 54+/-13 at 24 hs (p= 0.02), and PaO2/FiO2 change from 187.3+/-60.2 to 223.9+/-6.5 at one hour (p= 0.12) and to 245.8+/-75 at 24 hs (p= 0.03).

1008318,"Importance: Cholesterol content in high-density lipoprotein particles (HDL-C) is associated inversely with coronary heart disease (CHD), but findings from Mendelian randomization studies and randomized trials of HDL-C raising drugs have questioned whether this link is causal.  However, these analyses do not exclude a causal role for specific HDL sub-fractions of different density, mobility, size and composition.  Objective: To determine whether sub-components of the HDL pathway exhibit differing relationships with CHD risk. Design: In seven longitudinal studies, we used factor analysis to reduce 21 measures of HDL particle size and lipid content to a smaller number of factors representing different components of the HDL pathway. We constructed factor scores and modelled their associations on CHD risk in adjusted Cox regression analyses. We pooled results using random-effects meta-analysis. Setting: Seven population-, individual-, occupational- or community-based longitudinal studies in the UK and Finland. Participants: 28,597 participants (49% female, mean age 59.6 years) contributed to the analysis. Exposures: Sub-components of the HDL pathway, characterized by 21 measures of HDL size and lipid content based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Main Outcomes: Incident fatal or non-fatal CHD. Results: We identified 4 HDL components with highly replicable across studies; 3 were indices of particle size/composition (extra-large (XL), large (L) and medium/small (MS)), and the other an index of triglycerides (TG) carried in HDL of all sizes.

Rare risk variants are also important contributors to schizophrenia etiology but, with the exception of large copy number variants, are difficult to detect with GWAS.

1008323,"Background: Cardiovascular medication for secondary prevention has been shown to be effective. However, cardiovascular patients have poor medication adherence, the consequences of which include premature death, recurrence risk, hospitalization, and high financial cost for the healthcare system. Behavioral interventions based on text messaging technology are a promising strategy to improving adherence in medications. In low-middle income settings there is no high-quality evidence of a behavioral program delivered by SMS; hence we describe the development, message content, and the program design of the intervention for improving adherence to cardiovascular medication.  Methods: We used the model reported by Abroms and colleagues for developing and evaluating text messages-based interventions. This model describes a process in which the intervention created is based on theory and evidence, the target audience is involved to ensure the intervention is engaging and useful, and there is a focus on implementation from the outset. Results: Our main result was the design of the program, which consisted of a twelve-month structured intervention based on Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. We wrote and validated clusters of texts messages targeting each stage of the model.

We used a Bayesian hierarchical\r\nmodel to estimate trends from 1975 to 2016 in 200 countries for mean BMI\r\nand for prevalence of BMI in the following categories for children and\r\nadolescents aged 5-19 years: more than 2 SD below the median of the WHO\r\ngrowth reference for children and adolescents (referred to as moderate\r\nand severe underweight hereafter), 2 SD to more than 1 SD below the\r\nmedian (mild underweight), 1 SD below the median to 1 SD above the\r\nmedian (healthy weight), more than 1 SD to 2 SD above the median\r\n(overweight but not obese), and more than 2 SD above the median\r\n(obesity).\r\nFindings Regional change in age-standardised mean BMI in girls from 1975\r\nto 2016 ranged from virtually no change (-0.01 kg/m (2) per decade; 95\\%\r\ncredible interval -0.42 to 0.39, posterior probability {[}PP] of the\r\nobserved decrease being a true decrease = 0.5098) in eastern Europe to an\r\nincrease of 1.00 kg/m(2) per decade (0.69-1.35, PP> 0.9999) in central\r\nLatin America and an increase of 0.95 kg/m (2) per …",James Bentham and Mariachiara Di Cesare and Ver Bilano and Honor Bixby and Bin Zhou and Gretchen A Stevens and Leanne M Riley and Cristina Taddei and Kaveh Hajifathalian and Melanie J Cowan and Christopher J Paciore and Alison J Hayes and Joanne Katz and Andre Pascal Kengne and Young-Ho Khang and Yanping Li and Jun Ma and J Jaime Miranda and Martin Neovius and Cristina Padez and Lekhraj Rampal and Aubrianna Zhu and James E Bennet and Goodarz Danaei and Zulfiqar A Bhutta and Leandra Abarca-Gómez and Ziad A Abdeen and Zargar Abdul Hamid and Niveen M Abu-Rmeileh and Cecilia Acuin and Robert J Adams and Kaosar Afsana and Carlos A Aguilar-Salinas and Alireza Ahmadvand and Wolfgang Ahrens and Nazgul Akhtaeva and Hazzaa M Al-Hazzaa and Rajaa Al-Raddadi and Fadia AlBuhairan and Mohamed M Ali and Osman Ali and Ala' Alkerwi and Mar Alvarez-Pedrerol and Eman Aly and Deepak N Amarapurkar and Antoinette Amuzu and Lars Bo Andersen and Dolores S Andrade and Lars H Angquist and Hajer Aounallah-Skhiri and Joana Araujo and Tahir Aris and Nimmathota Arlappa and Dominique Arveiler and Krishna K Aryal and Thor Aspelund and Felix K Assah and Maria Cecilia F Assunçao and May Soe Aung and Maria Avdicova and F Azizi and Bontha V Babu and Suhad Bahijri and Jennifer L Baker and Nagalla Balakrishna and Mohamed Bamoshmoosh and Maciej Banach and Piotr Bandosz and Jose R Banegas and Alberto Barceló and Amina Barkat and Aluisio JD Barros and Mauro VG Barros and Iqbal Bata and AnwarM Batieha and Rosangela L Batista and Assembekov Batyrbek and Louise A Baur and Robert Beaglehole and Habiba Ben Romdhane and Judith Benedics and Mikhail Benet and Antonio Bernabe and Heloisa Bettiol and Aroor Bhagyalaxmi and Santosh K Bhargava and Zaid Bhatti and Hongsheng Bi and Yufang Bi and Anna Biehl and Mukharram Bikbov and Bihungum Bista and Dusko J Bjelica and Peter Bjerregaard and Espen Bjertnes and Marius B Bjness and Cecilia Bjorkelund and Anneke Blokstra and Simona Bo and Martin Bobak and LynneM Boddy and Bernhard O Boehm and Heiner Boeing and Jose G Boggia and Marialaura Bonaccio and Vanina Bongard and Lien Braeckevelt and Lutgart Braeckman and Marjolijn CE Bragt and Imperia Brajkovich and Francesco Branca and Joao Breda and Hermann Brenner and Lizzy M Brewster and Garry R Brian and Lacramioara Brinduse and Graziella Bruno and HB Bueno-de-Mesquita and Anna Bugge and Genc Burazeri and Con Burns and Antonio Cabrera de León and Joseph Cacciottolo and Hui Cai and Tilema Cama and José Camola and Gunay Can and Ana PCC Cândido and Mario Capanzana and Vincenzo Capuano and Viviane C Cardoso and Axel C Carlsson and Maria J Carvalho and Felipe F Casanueva and Juan Pablo Casas and Carmelo A Caserta and Snehalatha Chamukuttan and Angelique W Chan and Queenie Chan and Himanshu K Chaturvedi and Nishi Chaturvedi and Chien-Jen Chen and Fangfang Chen and Huashuai Chen and Shuohua Chen and Zhengming Chen and Ching-Yu Cheng and Angela Chetrit and Ekaterina Chikova-Iscener and Shu-Ti Chiou,1,12410790066978841295,The Lancet,,,,"Worldwide trends in body-mass index, underweight, overweight, and measurement studies in 128.9 million children, adolescents, and adults",https://accedacris.ulpgc.es/handle/10553/35324,,2017,/scholar?cites=12410790066978841295,Ey8XGUgAAAAJ:FsLZdJ3BAzkC

1008329,"Background. The coronary heart disease (CHD) risk locus on 21q22 (lead SNP rs9982601) lies within a “gene desert.” The aim of this study was to assess if this locus is associated with CHD risk factors and to identify the functional variant(s) and gene(s) involved. Methods. A phenome scan was performed with UCLEB Consortium data. Allele-specific protein binding was studied using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Dual-reporter luciferase assays were used to assess the impact of genetic variation on expression. Expression quantitative trait analysis was performed with Advanced Study of Aortic Pathology (ASAP) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium data. Results. A suggestive association between QT interval and the locus was observed (). One variant at the locus, rs28451064, showed allele-specific protein binding and its minor allele showed 12% higher luciferase expression ( = 4.82 × 10−3) compared to the common allele. The minor allele of rs9982601 was associated with higher expression of the closest upstream genes (SLC5A3 1.30-fold increase  = 3.98 × 10−5; MRPS6 1.15-fold increase  = 9.60 × 10−4) in aortic intima media in ASAP. Both rs9982601 and rs28451064 showed a suggestive association with MRPS6 expression in relevant tissues in the GTEx data. Conclusions. A candidate functional variant, rs28451064, was identified.

1008335,"It is well known that individuals from a disadvantaged socio-economic position (SEP) are at higher risk of coronary heart disease. However as suggested more than 26 years ago by Rose and Marmot, established cardiovascular risk factors, measured in adulthood, only explain part of the association. 1 This observation has lead to further research to identify other (possibly) modifiable factors that could explain the link between SEP and coronary heart disease. These could exert their effects from early life but there has been limited information on this so far. 2 Gimeno et al., in this issue of IJE, 3 examine C-reactive protein (CRP), a sensitive biomarker of inflammatory response, as a potential link between disadvantaged SEP and risk of coronary heart disease.

Methods We created a genetic risk score (GRS) for PCSK9 using four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at or near the PCSK9 locus known to impact lower LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C): rs11583680, rs11591147, rs2479409, and rs11206510. We then used our GRS to calculate weighted odds ratios reflecting the impact of a genetically determined 10 mg/dL decrease in LDL-C on several pre-specified phenotypes including CAD, IS, peripheral artery disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), type 2 diabetes, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer. Finally, we used our weighted GRS to perform a phenome-wide association study.

1008364,"Background: Drug development of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibition to prevent coronary heart disease (CHD) has yet to deliver licensed medicines. To distinguish compound from drug target failure, we compared evidence from clinical trials and Mendelian randomization (MR) results.   Methods: Findings from meta-analyses of CETP inhibitor trials (≥ 24 weeks follow-up) were used to judge between-compound heterogeneity in treatment effects. Genetic data were extracted on 190+ pharmacologically relevant outcomes; spanning 480,698-21,770 samples and 74,124-4,373 events. Drug target MR of protein concentration was used to determine the on-target effects of CETP inhibition and compared to that of PCSK9 modulation.   Results: Fifteen eligible CETP inhibitor trials of four compounds were identified, enrolling 79,961 participants. There was a high degree of heterogeneity in effects on lipids, lipoproteins, blood pressure, and clinical events. For example, dalcetrapib and evacetrapib showed a neutral effect, torcetrapib increased, and anacetrapib decreased cardiovascular disease (CVD); heterogeneity p-value < 0.001.

They represent an enormous potential resource for personalized, systemic and data-driven diagnosis, prevention, monitoring and treatment. However, the concept of using plasma proteins for individualized health assessment across many health conditions simultaneously has not been tested. Here, we show that plasma protein expression patterns strongly encode for multiple different health states, future disease risks and lifestyle behaviors.

1008366,"Strategies to develop therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be informed by experimental identification of viral-host protein interactions in cellular assays and measurement of host response proteins in COVID-19 patients. Identification of genetic variants that influence the level or activity of these proteins in the host could enable rapid ""in silico"" assessment in human genetic studies of their causal relevance as molecular targets for new or repurposed drugs to treat COVID-19. We integrated large-scale genomic and aptamer-based plasma proteomic data from 10,708 individuals to characterize the genetic architecture of 179 host proteins reported to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins or to participate in the host response to COVID-19. We identified 220 host DNA sequence variants acting in cis (MAF 0.01-49.9%) and explaining 0.3-70.9% of the variance of 97 of these proteins, including 45 with no previously known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) and 38 encoding current drug targets. Systematic characterization of pQTLs across the phenome identified protein-drug-disease links, evidence that putative viral interaction partners such as MARK3 affect immune response, and establish the first link between a recently reported variant for respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients at the ABO locus and hypercoagulation, i.e. maladaptive host response.

1008369,"Background: We characterised the phenotypic consequence of genetic variation at the PCSK9 locus and compared findings with recent trials of pharmacological inhibitors of PCSK9. Methods: Published and individual participant level data (300,000+ participants) were combined to construct a weightedPCSK9 gene-centric score (GS). Seventeen randomized placebo controlled PCSK9 inhibitor trials were included, providing data on 79,578 participants. Results were scaled to a one mmol/L lower LDL-C concentration. Results: The PCSK9 GS (comprising 4 SNPs) associations with plasma lipid and apolipoprotein levels were consistent in direction with treatment effects. The GS odds ratio (OR) for myocardial infarction (MI) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.42; 0.68), compared to a PCSK9 inhibitor effect of 0.90 (95% CI 0.86; 0.93). For ischemic stroke ORs were 0.84 (95% CI 0.57; 1.22) for the GS, compared to 0.85 (95% CI 0.78; 0.93) in the drug trials. ORs with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were 1.29 (95% CI 1.11; 1.50) for the GS, as compared to 1.00 (95% CI 0.96; 1.04) for incident T2DM in PCSK9 inhibitor trials. No genetic associations were observed for cancer, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or Alzheimer’s disease–outcomes for which large-scale trial data were unavailable.

We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. Methods For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure. Findings We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19.1 million adults. Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127.0 mm Hg (95% credible interval 125.7-128.3) in men and 122.3 mm Hg (121.0-123.6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78.7 mm Hg (77.9-79.5) for men and 76.7 mm Hg (75.9-77.6) for women.

1008389,"Background One of the global targets for non-communicable diseases is to halt, by 2025, the rise in the age-standardised adult prevalence of diabetes at its 2010 levels. We aimed to estimate worldwide trends in diabetes, how likely it is for countries to achieve the global target, and how changes in prevalence, together with population growth and ageing, are affecting the number of adults with diabetes. Methods We pooled data from population-based studies that had collected data on diabetes through measurement of its biomarkers. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends in diabetes prevalence-defined as fasting plasma glucose of 7.0 mmol/L or higher, or history of diagnosis with diabetes, or use of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs-in 200 countries and territories in 21 regions, by sex and from 1980 to 2014. We also calculated the posterior probability of meeting the global diabetes target if post-2000 trends continue. Findings We used data from 751 studies including 4 372 000 adults from 146 of the 200 countries we make estimates for. Global age-standardised diabetes prevalence increased from 4.3% (95% credible interval 2.4-7.0) in 1980 to 9.0% (7.2-11.1) in 2014 in men, and from 5.0% (2.9-7.9) to 7.9% (6.4-9.7) in women. The number of adults with diabetes in the world increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 (28.5% due to the rise in prevalence, 39.7% due to population growth and ageing, and 31.8% due to interaction of these two factors).

However, research resources allocated to NCDs in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) are trivial [2]. We analyse the interplay between applied health research in NCDs in highincome (HICs) and LMICs and demonstrate that there are opportunities for mutual advantages.

1008422," Introduction Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease that predisposes to aortic rupture, which has a high mortality. The only intervention that is proven to reduce rupture is invasive surgery. Understanding causal disease pathways may allow development of non-surgical therapies to target AAA formation, progression or rupture. In this study we investigate the role of interleukin-6 and AAA. Methods We performed systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature in order to determine the association between circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) and presence of AAA. We then investigated the association between a common non-synonymous variant in the interleukin-6 receptor gene (IL6R) and presence of AAA, performed in vitro functional analyses of this variant, and expression studies in aortic tissue.

1008424,"High blood pressure is the most com-mon modifiable cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide, 1 and blood pressure lowering drugs from four major classes (angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, β blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics) are prescribed in large volumes. Among these, treatment would be dictated by cost or tolerability if all drugs were of similar efficacy and safety and had an additive effect when used in combination. However, guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the British Hypertension Society emphasises differences between drug classes and combinations in blood pressure response and clinical outcomes. NICE’s recommendations are based on the view that younger patients (≤ 55 years) are more responsive to drugs targeting the reninangiotensin system than older patients; that β blockers are less effective than the other drug classes for the prevention of stroke; and that β blockers and diuretics lead to a clinically important increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes. Consequently, its 2006 guidelines gave primacy to angiotensin modifying drugs and calcium channel blockers, with a substantial influence on prescribing behaviour in Eng-",NICE Current,0,,BMJ,,21,,Could we simplify NICE guidance on choosing anti-hypertensive drugs?,https://commed.vcu.edu/Chronic_Disease/hypertension/2012/controversiesBMJ_2.pdf,344,2012,,Ey8XGUgAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC

1008437,"Background—Eligibility for rosuvastatin treatment for cardiovascular disease prevention includes a C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration 2 mg/L. Most observational studies of CRP and cardiovascular disease have been in Europeans. We evaluated the influence of ancestry on population CRP concentration to assess the implications for statin targeting in non-Europeans.Methods and Results—In a systematic review and meta-analysis among 221 287 people from 89 studies, geometric mean CRP was 2.6 mg/L (95% credible interval, 2.27 to 2.96) in blacks resident in the United States (n18 585); 2.51 mg/L (95% CI, 1.18 to 2.86) in Hispanics (n5049); 2.34 mg/L (95% CI, 1.99 to 2.8) in South Asians (n1053); 2.03 mg/L (95% CI, 1.77 to 2.3) in whites (n104 949); and 1.01 mg/L (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.18) in East Asians (n39 521). Differences were not explained by study design or CRP assay and were preserved after adjustment for age and body mass index.

This does not allow full use of available data and leads to the confounding of marker effects by closely associated markers. We present a Bayesian approach that exploits prior information on underlying haplotypes to allow multi-marker analysis incorporating data from all relevant studies of a gene or region, irrespective of the markers typed. We present results from application of our approach to data on a possible association between PDE4D and ischemic stroke.",Paul J Newcombe and Claudio Verzilli and Juan P Casas and Aroon D Hingorani and Liam Smeeth,0,,The American Journal of Human Genetics,,567-580,,and John C.

1008472,"Objective—6R-5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin (6R-BH4) is a cofactor for endothelial nitric oxide synthase but also has antioxidant properties. Its stereo-isomer 6S-5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin (6S-BH4) and structurally similar pterin 6R, S-5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro-D-neopterin (NH4) are also antioxidants but have no cofactor function. When endothelial nitric oxide synthase is 6R-BH4–deplete, it synthesizes superoxide rather than nitric oxide. Reduced nitric oxide bioavailability by interaction with reactive oxygen species is implicated in endothelial dysfunction (ED). 6R-BH4 corrects ED in animal models of ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and in patients with cardiovascular risks. It is uncertain whether the effect of exogenous 6R-BH4 on ED is through its cofactor or antioxidant action. Methods and Results—In healthy volunteers, forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography during intra-arterial infusion of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine, or the endothelium-independent vasodilator glyceryl trinitrate, before and after IRI. IRI reduced plasma total antioxidant status (P 0.03) and impaired vasodilatation to acetylcholine (P 0.01), but not to glyceryl trinitrate (P 0.3). Intra-arterial infusion of 6R-BH4, 6S-BH4 and NH4 at approximately equimolar concentrations prevented IRI. Conclusion—IRI causes ED associated with increased oxidative stress that is prevented by 6R-BH4, 6S-BH4, and NH4, an effect mediated perhaps by an antioxidant rather than cofactor function. Regardless of mechanism, 6R-BH4, 6S-BH4, or NH4 may reduce tissue injury during clinical IRI syndromes.(Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2007 …",Lila Mayahi and Simon Heales and David Owen and Juan P Casas and Joanne Harris and Raymond J MacAllister and Aroon D Hingorani,0,,,,,,Prevent Ischemia Reperfusion Injury in Human Forearm,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.606.2183&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,2007,,Ey8XGUgAAAAJ:PuOEWVtPfzwC

1008481,"Contesto. È opinione comune che gli inibitori della convertasi (ACE-inibitori) ei farmaci bloccanti il recettore per l’angiotensina-II (ARB) abbiano specifici effetti renoprotettivi. Le linee guida specificano che questi sono i farmaci di scelta per il trattamento dell’ipertensione in pazienti con nefropatia. Abbiamo cercato di determinare in che misura questa opinione è sostenuta dall’evidenza disponibile. Metodi. Sono stati consultati database elettronici fino a gennaio 2005 per cercare trial randomizzati che avessero valutato la relazione tra farmaci antipertensivi e progressione della nefropatia. Gli effetti sugli obiettivi primari non continui (raddoppiamento della creatinina e insufficienza terminale) e sui marcatori continui secondari di outcome renale (creatinina, albuminuria e filtrato glomerulare) sono stati calcolati con modelli a effetti casuali. Gli effetti degli ACE-inibitori o degli ARB in trial controllati con placebo sono stati confrontati con gli effetti osservati in trial che hanno usato un farmaco attivo paragonabile (trial comparativi). Risultati. Il confronto tra ACE-inibitori o ARB e altri farmaci antipertensivi ha rivelato un rischio relativo (RR) di 0, 71 (intervallo di confidenza, IC 95% 0, 49-1, 04) per raddoppiamento della creatinina e un modesto beneficio sulla insufficienza renale terminale (RR 0, 87; IC 95% 0, 75-0, 99). L’analisi dei risultati in base alle dimensioni dello studio ha mostrato benefici minori negli studi più estesi. Nei pazienti con nefropatia diabetica non è stato osservato beneficio nei trial di tipo comparativo con ACE-inibitori o con ARB sul raddoppiamento della creatinina (RR 1, 09; IC 95% 0, 55-2, 15), sulla insufficienza terminale (RR 0, 89; IC 95 …",JP Casas and W Chua and S Loukogeorgakis and P Vallance and L Smeeth and AD Hingorani and RJ MacAllister and Roche Diabetes Care Italy SpA,0,,G It Diabetol Metab,,91-93,,Dalla Letteratura,https://www.gidm.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GIDM_8.pdf,26,2006,,Ey8XGUgAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC

1008489,"Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired flow mediated dilatation (FMD). is a common feature in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Several studies have shown that plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are an independent predictor of future cardiovascular risk. However, whether or not endothelial dysfunction and inflammation are comparable markers in patients with cardiovascular risk factors is not well established. Therefore, in order to clarify this aspect, we have carried out a study in control subjects (n= 25) and dyslipidemic patients (n= 104) with and without coronary artery disease (CAD). Following parameters were evaluated: urinary excretion of nitrites+ nitrates (NO3+ NO2) and FMD as an index of endothelial function.

Two balanced groups of bucks were used. The 18th march 2005, one group (M group) received 3 s.c. implants of melatonin (N=7) and other group (N=4) was used like control (C group). From June to September, body weight and testosterone was measured weekly and testicular weight every 15 days. The reproductive activity of each buck was assessed using characteristics of the testosterone profile. During the first 8 days of each month, volume of ejaculate and sperm concentration was assessed. Each of these 8-d periods was divided into 3-d periods of daily sperm collection separated by 2 d of rest. The semen was collected using an artificial vagina. The effect of treatment and month was studied on each variable. An interaction, month-treatment was observed on ejaculate volume, July was the month with higher volume (0.62 ± 0.06 mL vs 1.07 ± 0.15 mL for M and C group respectively, P < 0.05).

[1] Cardiovascular mortality rates continue to increase in most LAC countries, and in those countries where rates have declined the blunting of the trend has been considerably lower than in the United Sates (US). [2]. Data on the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors in LAC region are limited, and the few studies available show significant variation in the levels of prevalence. For instance, the CARMELA study, [3] conducted in seven major urban cities from LAC, reported markedly different hypertension levels. For instance, hypertension prevalence in Santiago (Chile), Buenos Aires (Argentina), and Barquisimeto (Venezuela), ranged from 24% to 29%, whereas in Quito (Ecuador), Bogotá (Colombia), Mexico City (Mexico), and Lima (Peru) varied from 9% to 13%. Yet, diabetes prevalence in these cities was similar to world’s estimates, around 7%. [3] Differences in rural-urban residence, socioeconomic development, and internal migration patterns could partly explain the contrasting profiles of cardiovascular risk factors, but knowledge on this regard is also very limited. This scarcity of data on the distribution of risk factors and, in turn, on their impact on incidence and mortality hampers efforts to curtail the growing epidemic of cardiovascular disease in LAC. In fact, national and regional health policies have been customarily …",Jaime J Miranda Montero and Víctor Mauricio Herrera Galindo and Julio A Chirinos Medina and Luis Fernando Gómez Gutiérrez and Pablo Perel and Rafael Pichardo Estevez and Ángel González Medina and José Ramón Sánchez Abanro and Catterina Ferreccio and Ximena Aguilera Sanhueza and Eglé Silva and Myriam Oróstegui and Josefina Medina Lezama and Cynthia M Pérez and Erick Suárez and Ana Patricia Ortiz Martínez and Luis Rosero Bixby and Noberto Schapochnik and Zulma Ortiz and Daniel Ferrante and Juan P Casas and Leonelo Enrique Bautista Lorenzo,0,,,,,,Major cardiovascular risk factors in Latin America: a comparison with the United States.

1008545,"Nowadays there is a major concern in the public health field: waterborne diseases, specifically those caused by the presence of infectious agents in tap water. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) one tenth of the global disease burden could be prevented by improving the water supply, sanitation, hygiene and management of water resources [1], so taking measures to improve the quality of the consumption water is essential to guarantee the harmlessness of water for human beings.One of the most recurrent diseases caused by waterborne pathogens is diarrhoea. It occurs world-wide and causes 4% of all deaths and 5% of health loss to disability. It is most commonly caused by gastrointestinal infections which kill around 2.2 million people globally each year, mostly children under five years old living in developing countries [2]. Given this fact, the United Nations (UN) has established amongst its purposes on sustainable development to meet before 2030, the Global Water Goal, which aims to reduce by half the population that have no access to potable water in their homes [3].",Lina Garcia and Ángel Gallegos and Rosanna Margalef and Lorena Aguilar and Marc Vives and Antonio Francesko and Petya Petkova and Tzanko Tzanov and Juan Casas and Jordi Morató,0,,,,,,Cork filter with silver nanoparticles for Lab-Scale water disinfection.,http://www.nanobiomedconf.com/nanobiomedAbstracts/2015/2015_Margalef_Rosanna_rosannamargalef@gmail.com_nanoBio&Med2015_Nanomaterials%20for%20Bio%20and%20Medical%20Applications_Cork%20filter%20with%20silver%20nanoparticles%20for%20%20Lab-Scale%20water%20disinfection.pdf,,,,Ey8XGUgAAAAJ:j5aT6aphRxQC
