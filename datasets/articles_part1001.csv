1001005,"Neem seed oil, a possible precursor to new botanical insecticides, varies widely with respect to con-centrations of the limonoid azadirachtin, the putative active ingredient. Among 12 samples of neem oil analyzed by liquid chromatography, azadirachtin concentrations ranged from< 50 (limit of detec-tion) to over 4000 ppm. Oils were bioassayed for larval growth inhibition and antifeedant activity against the variegated cutworm (Peridroma saucia) and for molt disrupting activity against the milk-weed bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus). For each of the three bioassays, bioactivity of the oils, as measured by EC50 values, is highly correlated with azadirachtin content of the oils. From 72% to 90% of the variation in bioactivity of the oils can be accounted for by variation in azadirachtincontent.

Author has tried to develop a conceptual framework linking these three variables especially in higher education context. As the implication of these three variables are much different in service organization from that of manufacturing organization. The conceptual framework developed in this paper has explored the link among Academic Leadership, Motivation of Faculty Members, and Organizational Effectiveness in higher education context. This model can be useful for the policy makers and management of higher education, so that they can manage their staff in better way and to motivate them by using various motivators. Thus management and faculty members can jointly contribute to increase university’s effectiveness. This model can be fruitful for management, staff, students, and for the society as a whole.Design/Methodology-The conceptual framework has been developed in this paper.

The younger women exhibited significantly higher levels of each androgen, the differences being almost entirely attributable to ovarian failure in the older group. Although the older women reported the same levels of sexual desire and sexual arousal as the younger women, their intercourse frequencies and self-rated sexual gratification scores were significantly lower than the values obtained for the younger wives. One or more of the androgen levels related significantly and in the expected direction to each stage of the four-stage sexual response process. Global measures of so-called"" sexual adjustment"" and estimates of anxiety, depression, and hostility feelings experienced by these women did not relate significantly to any of the four androgen levels.The role of hormones in the sexual behavior of women has not been defined as clearly as in the case of men.

The flow of Maxwell nanofluid is assumed to be in an unsteady state. The basic governing equations changed to a group of differential equations, using proper similarity variables. The obtained modeled equations are nonlinear and coupled. An optimal approach is used to acquire the solution of the modeled problem analytically. The effects of electric field, magnetic field and thermal radiations on Maxwell nanofluid are the main focus in this study.

1001085,"A hydroponics experiment was conducted in the University of Zhejiang Hangzhou, China to investigate the effect of salinity (NaCl) and cadmium (Cd) on root morphology of different wheat cultivars differing in salt tolerance. Cd and NaCl stress inhibited shoot and root dry weight, number of root tips (lateral roots), total root length, root average diameter and total root volume. Increasing concentration of Cd and NaCl had negatively affected root morphology of all cultivars under study. The combined effect of Cd and NaCl on these parameters was more than both Cd and NaCl alone. There was an obvious difference in response to both stresses among the three cultivars with Bakhtawar-92 being less affected.",Mohammad Shafi and G Zhang and Jehan Bakht and M Aman Khan and UE Islam and M Dawood Khan and GZ Raziuddin,63,7994104804472391621,Pak J Bot,4,2747-2754,,Effect of cadmium and salinity stresses on root morphology of wheat,http://www.pakbs.org/pjbot/PDFs/42(4)/PJB42(4)2747.pdf,42,2010,/scholar?cites=7994104804472391621,oZB5st8AAAAJ:UFuRdyijzaAC

1001106,"In the present investigation inhibitory effect of two antibiotics viz., Penicillin and Tetracycline against Staphylococcus aureus was observed separately and in combination (synergistic). It was found that the zone of inhibition was 23mm for tetracycline and 18 mm for penicillin. However, their synergistic effect was much more effective and caused an inhibition that measured 27 mm in diameter. Apart from this these antibiotics were also applied in combination with various extracts (ethanolic) of Salvadora persica, a medicinal plant of repute. The highest inhibition was noticed (31.5 mm) when S. aureus was exposed to tetracycline+ Salvadora stem extract. It was followed by tetracycline+ leaf extract combination of Salvadora persica with a zone of inhibition of 30.0 mm. The combination of stem and leaf extract with penicillin could not produce the same inhibitory effect as that of tetracycline and Salvadora stem and leaf extracts.

Further, this study explores the difference between male and female field employees perception regarding their intention to leave the organization. The sample of the study consisted of 250 field employees working in different banks of Rawalpindi and Islamabad through questionnaire; only 188 were returned and processed. The SPSS technique was used for data analysis and findings. The study concludes that employee voice mechanism has a positive and significant impact on employee intention to leave. This study finds that male are comparatively more intended to leave the organization with less effective voice mechanism and higher qualified employees are more conscious about voice mechanism in the banking sector.",Ahmed Imran Hunjra and Muhammad Asghar Ali and Dr Chani and Muhammad Irfan and Hashim Khan and Kashif Ur Rehman,50,16478990135504449566,African Journal of Business Management,14,3056-3061,,Employee voice and intent to leave: An empirical evidence of Pakistani banking sector,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1750389,4,2010,/scholar?cites=16478990135504449566,oZB5st8AAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC

1001135,"The available data suggest that among cellular constituents, proteins are the major target for oxidation primarily because of their quantity and high rate of interactions with ROS. Proteins are susceptible to ROS modifications of amino acid side chains which alter protein structure. Among the amino acids, Cysteine (Cys) is more prone to oxidation by ROS because of its high nucleophilic property. The reactivity of Cys with ROS is due to the presence of thiol group. In the oxidised form, Cys forms disulfide bond, which are primary covalent cross-link found in proteins, and which stabilize the native conformation of a protein. Indirect evidence suggests that thiol modifications by ROS may be involved in neurodegenerative disorders, but the significance and precise extent of the contributions are poorly understood.

1001146,"Objective: To evaluate the gender differences in age at onset of schizophrenia. Design: Prospective case control study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Psychiatry, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi between January to December 2002.Patients and Methods: Sixty patients admitted consecutively to psychiatry ward and meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled for the study. Age at onset of illness was defined as age at onset of gross psychotic symptoms, age at first contact with psychiatrist and age at index admission. Statistical method included two independent samples t-test. Data was dichotomized into those with family history of schizophrenia versus those without family history of illness and then Chi-square test of association was applied.Results: The mean age of onset of illness was 23.96 years in females and 24.13 years in males. In all other measures used to assess the onset of illness, females were overrepresented at the younger age group. 56.7% patients had a family history of psychotic disorder. Among them the mean ages at onset of illness were 20.59 years in females and 21.85 years in males (χ 0.04 df= 58). The illness occurred at a younger age in those with positive family history of schizophrenia (21.22 years) than those without it (25.14 years) with dissipation of gender difference in the former.Conclusion: There was no significant gender difference in age at onset of disorder in this study.

1001152,"Injection of PGF2 alpha (250 microgram/rat) 15 min prior to isolation of corpora lutea (CL) from PMSG treated immature rats significantly reduced the LH stimulation of adenylate cyclase in CL membranes. The LH stimulation did not return to normal even 24 h after PGF2 alpha injection. A transient decrease in epinephrine and fluoride stimulation of AC was also observed, the response returning to normal 6-12 h after PGF2 alpha treatment. In vitro incubation of whole isolated CL with 0.005 micrometer or higher concentrations of PGF2 alpha markedly reduced the LH and fluoride stimulation of AC in the CL membranes. Exposure of CL to PGF2 alpha for 15 min in vitro reduced the LH and fluoride response.

Factors affecting dough rheology and influences of various additives on the rheological properties of flour doughs are illustrated and the component interactions are emphasized. The most commonly used rheological test methods and their relationships to product functionality are reviewed. Rheological testing has become a powerful and preferred approach for examining the structure and the fundamental properties of wheat flour doughs because of its characteristic and sensitive response to the structure variation of wheat flour doughs. It is shown that the most commonly used method for rheological testing of doughs, shear oscillation dynamic rheology, is generally used under deformation conditions inappropriate for bread making and shows little relationship with end-use performance. The frequency range used in conventional shear oscillation tests is limited to the plateau region, which is insensitive to changes in the HMW glutenin polymers thought to be responsible for variations in baking quality. Molecular size and structure of the gluten polymers that make up the major structural components of wheat are related to their rheological properties via modern polymer rheology concepts.

Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with increased thrombosis. In patients presenting with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), it is not known whether this association is reflected in the degree of myocardial injury. This was a cross sectional study conducted among the patients with acute myocardial infarction in the Department of Cardiology, Dhaka Medical College Hospital during the period of October 2009 to September 2010 and which included 194 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction. The mean (±SD) serum homocysteine level was 20.2±14.3? mol/L with range from 7.4 to 129.1? mol/L. Mean serum troponin-I level was classified according to normal (< 15? mol/L) and high (? 15? mol/L) levels of serum homocysteine values. The mean serum troponin-I level was 8.9±8.6 ng/ml in the patients having normal serum homocysteine level and 18.4±6.5 ng/ml in the patients having high serum homocysteine level. A significant positive correlation (r= 0.273; p< 0.001) was found between serum troponin-I level with homocysteine level. Patients with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia (? 15? mol/L) was found to be 7.09 times more likely to have increased serum troponin-I (a surrogate marker of extent of myocardial injury).

1001208,"Background The optimal timing of cholecystectomy for patients admitted with acute gallbladder pathology is unclear. Some studies have shown that emergency cholecystectomy during the index admission can reduce length of hospital stay with similar rates of conversion to open surgery, complications and mortality compared with a ‘delayed’ operation following discharge. Others have reported that cholecystectomy during the index acute admission results in higher morbidity, extended length of stay and increased costs. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of emergency versus delayed cholecystectomy for acute benign gallbladder disease. Methods Using data from a prospective population-based cohort study examining the outcomes of cholecystectomy in the UK and Ireland, a model-based cost–utility analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service, with a 1-year time horizon for costs and outcomes. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the impact of parameter uncertainty on the results obtained from the model. Results Emergency cholecystectomy was found to be less costly (£4570 versus £4720; €5484 versus €5664) and more effective (0·8868 versus 0·8662 QALYs) than delayed cholecystectomy. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the emergency strategy is more than 60 per cent likely to be cost-effective across willingness-to-pay values for the QALY from £0 to £100 000 (€0–120 000).

1001210,"Protein solubility is usually characterized in terms of a hydrophobicity scale, which refers to the free energy of transfer of a molecule from an aqueous to a nonpolar solution and is not a “solubility propensity scale” per se. Using a “host–guest” approach, we measured the effects of short poly-amino-acid tags (guests) on the solubility of a host protein, a simplified bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), to which they were fused at the C-terminus. We analyzed 10 amino acid types, representing the full range of biophysical properties (acidic, basic, polar, and hydrophobic). As anticipated, positively charged residues significantly increased the solubility of the model protein, at both pH 4.7 and 7.7, whereas very hydrophobic poly-Ile markedly reduced the solubility of BPTI.

1001211,"In Pakistan, the banking performance is influenced by deregulation, financial modernization and technological improvement. Financial sector is the back bone of the sustainable economic growth. So it is very important to assess the negative shocks in order to maintain the financial stability in Pakistan. This study is conducted to find out the main determinants of banks profitability considering the bank specific variables. The analysis has been conducted on 16 banks on the basis of availability of data over the period 2000 to 2010. This paper uses fixed effect model and random effect model to examine the impacts of net interest margin, profit to asset ratio, bank size, loan growth, non-interest earning, overhead expenses, taxation, insider lending, operating expenses, non-performing loans, return on asset ratio and deposit to asset ratio. The empirical results show a strong association between some banks specific variables and their profitability. The variables of deposit to asset ratio, deposit to loans ratio, loans to asset ratio, loan growth, non-performing loans, net interest margin, tax, non-interest income and return on asset are the main determinates of banks profitability in our analysis. Furthermore, the banks are divided into two groups according to their market capitalization ie large and small banks.. LNG is significant at 1% with positive value (3.56734) indicating that with loan growth, the bank’s capacity to earn more in the market enhances. In case of small banks, the variable of loan growth is insignificant.

1001212,"Bangladesh hills are basically composed of unconsolidated sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, siltstone, shale and conglomerate. Unsustainable landsuse and alteration in the hills including indiscriminate deforestation and hill cutting are two major factors in Bangladesh that aggravated the landslide vulnerability in the hilly areas. Excessive rainfall within shorter time span often cause landslide specifically in the areas composed of unconsolidated rocks. This situation is further aggravated if the slopes are steep and exposed because of indiscriminate hill cutting. Because of climate change, the country is experiencing extremely high intensity rainfall in the recent years which is making the situation real grave. Chittagong city is the second largest city of Bangladesh comprising hills formed during tertiary time. A north-south hill range crosses the city and many settlements and slums have been developed in the foothills and lower income people are living in these areas in a risky situation. On 11 June, 2007, a massive landslide happened in Chittagong city area. As a result, a number of foothill settlements and slums were demolished; more than 90 people died and huge resource destruction took place. Landslide is a common event in Chittaogng and Chittagong Hill Tract region of Bangladesh but intensity and magnitude of the recent occurrence has crossed all previous events.

1001216,"Late blight, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, is one of the most devastating diseases affecting potato and tomato worldwide. Early diagnosis of the P. infestans pathogen causing late blight should be the top priority for addressing disease epidemics and management. In this study, we performed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nested PCR, and real-time PCR to verify and compare the sensitivity and specificity of the reaction based on the Ypt1 (Ras-related protein) gene of P. infestans. In comparison with the PCR-based assays, the LAMP technique led to higher specificity and sensitivity, using uncomplicated equipment with an equivalent time frame. All 43 P. infestans isolates, yielded positive detection results using LAMP assay showing no cross reaction with other Phytophthora spp., oomycetes or fungal pathogens. The LAMP assay yielded the lowest detectable DNA concentration (1.28 × 10–4 ng μL–1), being 10 times more sensitive than nested PCR (1.28 × 10–3 ng μL–1), 100 times more sensitive than real-time PCR (1.28 × 10–2 ng μL–1) and 103 times more sensitive than the conventional PCR assay (1.28 × 10–1 ng μL–1). In the field experiment, the LAMP assay outperformed the other tests by amplifying only diseased tissues (leaf and stem), and showing no positive reaction in healthy tissues.

1001234,"Emerging evidence suggests that sleep plays a key role in procedural learning, particularly in the continued development of motor skill learning following initial acquisition. We argue that a detailed examination of the time course of performance across sleep on the finger-tapping task, established as the paradigm for studying the effect of sleep on motor learning, will help distinguish a restorative role of sleep in motor skill learning from a proactive one. Healthy subjects rehearsed for 12 trials and, following a night of sleep, were tested. Early training rapidly improved speed as well as accuracy on pre-sleep training. Additional rehearsal caused a marked slow-down in further improvement or partial reversal in performance to observed levels below theoretical upper limits derived on the basis of early pre-sleep rehearsal. This decrement in learning efficacy does not occur always, but if and only if it does, overnight sleep has an effect in fully or partly restoring the efficacy and actual performance to the optimal theoretically achieveable level. Our findings re-interpret the sleep-dependent memory enhancement in motor learning reported in the literature as a restoration of fatigued circuitry specialized for the skill. In providing restitution to the fatigued brain, sleep eliminates the rehearsal-induced synaptic fatigue of the circuitry specialized for the task and restores the benefit of early pre-sleep rehearsal. The present findings lend support to the notion that latent sleep-dependent enhancement of performance is a behavioral expression of the brain's restitution in sleep.",Bhavin R Sheth and Davit Janvelyan and Murtuza Khan,27,7130836608893160704,PLoS One,9,e3190,Public Library of Science,Practice makes imperfect: restorative effects of sleep on motor learning,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003190,3,2008,/scholar?cites=7130836608893160704,oZB5st8AAAAJ:ent5SSDJ8eoC

SACE levels were also found elevated in other clinical conditions like tuberculosis (mean 58.64 lUlL), but the enzyme level were less (p0. 04) than those found in sarcoidosis (mean (92-97 lUlL). SACE activity was found to be considerably lower in other chronic lung diseases such as, fibrosing alveolitis (mean 43.98 lUlL), interstitial lung disease (mean 42.11 lU/L) and chronic obstructive lung disease (mean 40.85 lUlL). Twenty patients of sarcoidosis, who received steroid tretalment subsequently showed a decline in the SACE levels. SACE is a useful marker in differential diagnosis as 37.2% cases of sarcoidosis compared to only 9.09% of tuberculosis had SACE levels greater than 100 lUlL.

This paper, being qualitative in nature, reveals that the nation has achieved an exemplary success in primary education as regards increased enrolment rate, while the enrolment rate is not satisfactory in secondary schooling and the tertiary education is expanding. However, the quality of education imparted at all the primary, secondary and tertiary levels is not up to the mark to create a strong human capital and reckon the prospect of knowledge-based society in the country. A number of reform measures are required to be undertaken in order to ensure quality education and create an effective knowledge base in the nation.",Md Khan and Nasir Uddin and Ebney Ayaj Rana and Md Haque,23,7237223831276370215,World Journal of Education,4,1-11,"Sciedu Press. 1120 Finch Avenue West Suite 701-309, Toronto, ON., M3J 3H7, Canada",Reforming the Education System in Bangladesh: Reckoning a Knowledge-Based Society.,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1158547,4,2014,/scholar?cites=7237223831276370215,oZB5st8AAAAJ:COU-sansr_wC

Different types of sea walls were placed in front of the building model. The tsunami forces and the wave heights were measured with and without the sea wall conditions. Types of sea wall, wall height, and wall positions were varied simultaneously to quantify the force reductions. Maximum of 41% forces was reduced by higher sea wall, positioned closer proximity to the model whereas this reduction was about 27% when the wall height was half of the high wall. Experimental investigations revealed that wall with adequate height and placed closer to the structures enables a satisfactory predictor of the force reduction on onshore structures. Another set of tests were performed with perforated wall placing near the building model. Less construction cost makes the provision of perforated sea wall interesting. The overall results showed that the efficacy of perforated wall is almost similar to solid wall. Hence, it can be efficiently used instead of solid wall.

1001293,"In this study, the antioxidative fraction of white mulberry (Morus alba) was found to have an apotogenic effect on Ehrlich’s ascites carcinoma cell-induced mice (EAC mice) that correlate with upregulated p53 and downregulated NFκB signaling. The antioxidant activities and polyphenolic contents of various mulberry fractions were evaluated by spectrophotometry and the ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) was selected for further analysis. Strikingly, the EAF caused 70.20% tumor growth inhibition with S-phase cell cycle arrest, normalized blood parameters including red/white blood cell counts and suppressed the tumor weight of EAC mice compared with untreated controls. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of EAF-treated EAC cells revealed DNA fragmentation, cell shrinkage, and plasma membrane blebbing. These characteristic morphological features of apoptosis influenced us to further investigate pro- and anti-apoptotic signals in EAF-treated EAC mice. Interestingly, apoptosis correlated with the upregulation of p53 and its target genes PARP-1 and Bax, and also with the down-regulation of NFκB and its target genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.

All growth parameters except plants corm-1 studied during the experiment were significantly affected by the two experimental years. Plants emergence (Sprouting), spike emergence, first floret and full spike opening were earlier in first year (2003-04). Number of plants corm-1 was more in first year whereas plant height was higher in second year (2004-05). Potassium levels significantly affected days to spike emergence and first florets opening. Spike emergence was earlier at 100kg ha-1 and first floret opening was delayed with an increase in potassium levels. Cultivars irrespective of years and potassium levels were significantly different in preflowering growth characteristics. Similarly years X cultivars interaction resulted in significant differences in preflowering growth characteristics.

1001316,"Early blight (EB), caused by the pathogen Alternaria solani, is a major threat to global potato and tomato production. Early and accurate diagnosis of this disease is therefore important. In this study, we conducted a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, as well as conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nested PCR, and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) assays to determine which of these techniques was less time consuming, more sensitive, and more accurate. We based our assays on sequence-characterised amplified regions of the histidine kinase gene. The LAMP assay provided more rapid and accurate results, amplifying the target pathogen in less than 60 min at 63°C, with 10-fold greater sensitivity than conventional PCR. Nested PCR was 100-fold more sensitive than the LAMP assay and 1000-fold more sensitive than conventional PCR. RT-qPCR was the most sensitive among the assays evaluated, being 10-fold more sensitive than nested PCR for the least detectable genomic DNA concentration (100 fg). The LAMP assay was more sensitive than conventional PCR, but less sensitive than nested PCR and RT-qPCR; however, it was simpler and faster than the other assays evaluated. The LAMP assay amplified A. solani artificially, allowing us to naturally infect young potato leaves, which produced early symptoms of EB. The LAMP assay also achieved positive amplification using diluted pure A. solani culture instead of genomic DNA.

Design/methodology/approach–This research is quantitative in nature. A survey has been conducted among 45 employees and managers of sales and service departments from telecom sector particularly from Mobilink, Ufone, Warid and Telenor as these four companies are holding 85-90% market share of cellular market in Pakistan. Employees selected are having minimum academic qualification of graduation and have served for 2-10 years in the telecom sector. The companies are also very conscious for not to share their information due to highly completive nature of market. The research’s hypotheses were tested using various statistical analyses.

This paper develops a new approach to trade balance modeling that captures the effects of the factors suggested by the conventional model and explores the dynamic relationship between variables of the new model. Using recently developed dynamic panel data analysis techniques, the approach is empirically tested for Bangladesh's trade with its 50 major trading partners for over 26 years and finds the existence of cointegration, that is, stable longrun relationship between variables of the new trade balance model.

1001336,"This article presents the findings of a study conducted to explore the role of teachers in career counseling in secondary schools in Gilgit-Baltistan of Pakistan. The key findings illustrate that teachers have vital roles to guide students for their careers; they voluntarily act as informal counselors guiding students in their choices of subjects and career paths. In addition, students also see their teachers as role models and attach high value to their advice and guidance related to the subjects and career selection. Practices such as the educated parents providing career guidance to their children and students seeking career information from media are common in both the Government Education Department and the NGO-run private schools in Gilgit-Baltistan. However, the findings reflect that the NGO-run private schools have better quality career services for students than the Government Education Department-run schools. Likewise, students in both the education providing systems face numerous challenges related to their career choices. For instance, access to quality and timely information and the scarcity of appropriate resources for career counseling seem to hamper students in both the education providing systems.

1001346,"BACKGROUND: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is the second leading contributor to the prevailing perinatal mortality and morbidity. It affects 23.8% of newborns around the world and 75% of these affected infants are born in Asia. In Pakistan the incidence of IUGR is around 25%, more than the WHO criteria for triggering a public health action. INTRODUCTION: IUGR is implicated with profound long-term impacts in adult life; like coronary heart disease, NIDDM and abnormal cortisol levels. The effects of the short and long term sequelae are reviewed. ETIOLOGY: IUGR is associated with a wide variety of etiological factors. But the factor unique in its importance to Pakistan is maternal malnutrition. The fetal gene expression is under the influence of nutrition. Growth projection curves showing the interaction between the genetic and environmental factors are discussed. SURVEILLANCE: Identification of IUGR baby in a primary care setting and the options in diagnosis in secondary and tertiary care settings are overviewed. CONCLUSION: The roots of this problem, with multi factorial causes are in the socioeconomic infrastructure. This calls for a synergistic approach of reducing this public health issue. Women empowerment can help us to get out of this intergenerational cycle of growth failure.

1001379,"In view of the fact that Bacopa monniera’s main salutary use is to enhance cognitive function, most studies have focused on the mechanism behind these properties and the consequences showed that the triterpenoid saponins and their bacosidesA and B are responsible for Bacopa’s ability to enhance nerve impulse transmission. Its use in natural medicine as a nerve tonic, improves memory and mental functions; moreover the bacosides aid in repair of damaged neurons by enhancing kinase activity, neuronal synthesis, and restoration of synaptic activity, and eventually nerve impulse transmission. Traditional use of brahmi is widespread but one of its therapeutic benefits is tremendous ensuing mental enhancement within few hours or a few days depending on the dosage used by an individual. Due to this tendency there has been over exploitation of native plants in various systems of Indian medicine, and therefore these plants are on the verge of extinction. Hence it’s essential to develop approaches for accessibility of reliable raw material from regular and viable sources. The conservation of the existing flora is essential so as to save the biodiversity and additional efforts must be anticipated for higher yield of precious medicinal plants, of which two significant plant species (among 7 plants) are specifically recommended by Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC) for immediate attention during 2001-2005, they are;",Arshiya Tanveer and Mahnaaz Khan and Fatema Shah,16,2865438237126262201,Nanobiotechnica Universale,2,139-150,,In Vitro micropropagation of Brahmi-Bacopa monnieri (L.)

1001381,"In demography, large-scale surveys often follow a nested structure of data because information is collected from different levels of hierarchy. It is thus necessary to elicit the inherent variations, which occur for a particular phenomenon between those levels. Exploring this idea, the present study seeks to detect variations resulting from such nested structure in the case of contraceptive practice in Bangladesh, as well as identify factors affecting the individual’s behavior. Applying the newly developed theories of multilevel analysis, a functional model is developed for current use of contraception, using data collected in the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, 1996-97. From the constructed model, it is observed that the necessary factors defining women’s attitudes towards contraception are the woman’s age; the number of male children in her family; whether she takes decisions on family planning issues individually or jointly; the number of family planning services she received and her current working status. In addition, the multilevel model reflects the existence of significant variations in the mean effects of the predictors of current contraceptive practice in lower administrative levels. The study shows that due to the widespread activities of family planning services in recent times, such services have received encouraging reaction from women in all parts of Bangladesh. Family planning services have successfully increased the level of awareness as it has led to non-variable contribution among the levels of hierarchies.

To match up and evaluate the production and income of beneficiaries with non-beneficiaries an independent sample t-test was used. The results show that only (12%) of the beneficiaries respondents have utilized credit for the right purpose while the majority of them (ie 88%) have utilized credit for mixed purposes like for agriculture purpose, household expenditures, marriages and for reconciliation purposes. The results also specify that credit has no positive effect on production and income of the farmers in the area.

The automatic gender detection from face images has potential applications in visual surveillance and human-computer interaction systems (HCI). Human faces provide important visual information for gender perception. This research presents a novel approach for gender detection from facial images. The system can automatically detect face from input images and the detected facial area is taken as region of interest (ROI). Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) of that ROI plays an important role in gender detection. A gender knowledgebase of the processed DCT is created utilizing supervised learning. To detect gender, input image is passed through a classifier which is based on that knowledgebase. To improve the matching accuracy Local Binary Pattern (LBP) of the ROI is done before converting it into DCT.

The study was designed to determine and compare the levels of oxidative stress and iron indices in Coronary Heart Disease and healthy individuals. Material and Methods: Blood malondialdehyde, iron, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation and ferretin levels were determined in 140 Coronary Heart Disease and 100 healthy subjects. Results: Values of blood malondialdehyde, iron, transferrin saturation and ferretin were observed to be significantly increased with exception of total iron-binding capacity, which was significantly decreased (p< 0.005) in Coronary Heart Disease patients when compared with normal healthy controls. Conclusion: Elevated serum malondialdehyde, iron concentration and body iron stores in patients reveal a possible role of iron indices in the development of coronary atherosclerosis. Therefore, it is suggested by this study that levels of malondialdehyde and biochemical markers of body iron stores can be used as an early investigative tool for assessing the oxidative stress in coronary heart disease.",Muhammad Ahmad and Mudassir Ahmad Khan and Abdus Sattar Khan,14,18425685999999799229,Journal of Ayub Medical College Abbottabad,2,56-59,,Oxidative stress and level of iron indices in coronary heart disease patients,http://jamc.ayubmed.edu.pk/index.php/jamc/article/download/3358/1562,21,2009,/scholar?cites=18425685999999799229,oZB5st8AAAAJ:rrpmhsargb8C

For some combination of the NPR and L/D ratio the flow field in the duct becomes oscillatory which; indicates that the flow in the duct is dominated by the waves however, it remained same even when the control in the form of micro jets are activated. Hence, the control does influence the flow in the duct wall. It is also seen that when the jets are under expanded the control becomes effective; however, with further increase in the level of under expansion they do not give the desired result. Hence, there seems to be a limiting value of level of expansion which will give desired result and at Mach 1.25, this value is Pe/Pa= 1.5.",S Khan and Musavir Bashir and M Asadullah,13,15573884821354552386,Journal of Scientific Research and Development,5,1-6,,An investigation of base flow control by wall pressure analysis in a suddenly expansion nozzle,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sher_Khan17/publication/305470199_An_investigation_of_base_flow_control_by_wall_pressure_analysis_in_a_suddenly_expansion_nozzle/links/57901f1708ae108aa03af636/An-investigation-of-base-flow-control-by-wall-pressure-analysis-in-a-suddenly-expansion-nozzle.pdf,3,2016,/scholar?cites=15573884821354552386,oZB5st8AAAAJ:B_SudGh4-BUC

The amount of sawdust generated every year constitutes up to 10-13% of the total volume of wood log. Such an enormous amount serves as waste material for landfill and is not utilized. Effective utilization of waste sawdust ash to enhance the engineering properties of soil could result in a solution of the landfill problem, which was the objective of this study. Permeability and direct shear tests were conducted to analyze the impact of waste sawdust ash on the properties of soil. After noticing the behavior, the optimum quantity of (12%) SDA was selected and further compaction and shrinkage limit tests on soil with 12% SDA were conducted.

1001443,Requirements engineering is very crucial phase of software development cycle. Different sub activities are performed during requirements engineering. Previous research shows that there are various techniques regarding requirements verification and validation. These techniques can have different relative importance in different situation. Typically the requirements engineers don’t have proper knowledge regarding nature of each technique. Existing requirements validation & verification techniques differ in their ability to effectively cover the system requirements. It is highly desirable to conduct an empirical study on requirements verification and validation techniques to know their relative importance in opinion of different experts. In this study we developed a questionnaire based on requirements verification and validation techniques and their relative importance. Analysis of the results indicates that according to experts point of view (based on their experiences and judgments) ambiguous requirements are the biggest reason behind requirements verification and validation issues.

1001453,In this paper two bifilar helices are employed in the design of a quadrifilar helix structure that is used as an antenna for satellite communication. The antenna is purely made to resonate at GPS L2 frequency band that is 1227.75 +/- 10MHz having 90° out of phase feeds to obtain a circularly polarized electric field. Simulation results show that the bandwidth of the antenna for VSWR≤ 2 is about 50MHz from 1205MHz to 1260MHz. The antenna is giving a fairly directional pattern in its elevation plane at its resonant frequency of 1228 MHz and the simulated front to back ratio is more than 20dB with a front gain of nearly 6dB.

The pH was found to have a pronounced effect on adsorption. The change in adsorption due to pH level might be caused by ionization of the phenol into cationic and anionic species and by the respective positive and negative charged surfaces of carbon, which it acquired at low and high pH levels. An increase in degassing temperature was also found to have a significant effect on the adsorption of phenol. This was thought to be due to the comparatively non‐polar surface and large surface area of the carbon samples degassed at high temperatures.

1001506,"Rutting is one of the major distresses which cause hydroplaning and structural failures in a flexible pavement. The extent of damage depends upon the load induced and the strength of each pavement layer. Rutting can occur due to the failure of the subgrade, the base or at the wearing surface/hot mixasphalt (HMA) layer (s). In order to take remedial measures, it is imperative to be cognizant of the contribution of each layer to ascertain the cause of underlying phenomena of rutting. This research study demonstrates the analysis of the pavement transverse surface profile that could be used to identify the layer responsible for the permanent deformation. Transverse surface profiling techniqueis easier, non-destructive, and economicalas compared to traditional methods of coring and trenching to examine underlying layers. A 300 meter section on National Highway (N-5) was selected exhibiting severe rutting to perform transverse profile analysis. Results of this study suggest that rutting at the selected site is mainly due to the shear failure of HMA layer. These results were also validated by field trenching on the test section.

1001507,"There has been a growing concern among different actors in cotton supply chain and consumers about the impacts of its cultivation. Inefficient crop management practices in cotton crop contribute to water losses led to significant degradation of freshwater resources, biodiversity and the services that rivers provide. Cotton is also a ‘highly polluted crop’due to intensive and indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, contributing to serious environmental, social and economic problems in areas where it is cultivated.WWF-P and IKEA have been collaborating under"" Pakistan Sustainable Cotton Initiatives (PSCI)"" since 2005 for the development and promotion of site-specific Better Management Practices. Due to encouraging results, the collaboration further expanded under Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) which is a multi-stakeholder initiative launched in 2005 with the objective of globally raising the sustainability standard of conventional cotton and making it available in large volumes to mainstream retailers at the same price as conventional cotton. The BCI exists to make global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in and better for the sector’s future. As a result of horizontal and vertical expansion, more than 40000 farmers participated in the program to grow better cotton over an area of about 170,000 hectares during 2010. Better farmers made crop management decisions which led to 37.5% reduction in water use, 47% in pesticide use and around 41% in fertilizer achieving 1: 2.3 cost-benefit ratios compared with 1: 1.1 by non-BMP farmers.

1001511,"This thesis is about the kingdom of Aceh Dar al-Salam in the latter half of the seventeenth century when four women ruled in succession: Sultanah Tajul Alam Safiatuddin Syah (1641-1675), Sultanah Nur Alam Naqiatuddin Syah (1675-1678), Sultanah Inayat Zakiatuddin Syah (1678-1688) and Sultanah Iamalat Zainatuddin Syah (1688-1699). How and why these queens came to power, and how they exercised it, are problems that have fascinated enquirers, prompting a range of comments and observations, especially the assertion that the queens were mere figureheads, during whose reigns the male elite (orangkaya) captured power. The Sultanahs were held responsible for the erosion of royal power and the kingdom's decline in the seventeenth century. Yet no in-depth study has ever investigated these claims. The main objective of this thesis is to evaluate the received views on these female sovereigns. The thesis also seeks to examine the origin, nature and impact of these Sultanahs. Female rule seems a curious phenomenon in a Muslim state. Furthermore, in a largely patriarchal kingdom such as Aceh, queens seemed to be strangely out of place. This unique episode in Aceh's history happened when European Companies - the Dutch VOC (Veerinigde Ooost-Indische Compagnie) and the English East India Company - were gradually increasing their commercial hold and flexing their military muscles in the region. Indigenous polities suffered increasing interference and pressure from Westerners. Most Malay and Muslim coastal polities in maritime Southeast Asia fell into European intruders' hands.

1001512,"Background Many cases of post-operative and posttraumatic endophthalmitis are being managed at the Khyber Institute of Ophthalmic Medical Sciences, Peshawar in Pakistan but no study has been done to ascertain the magnitude of the disease and to also evaluate the visual outcome after management. Methods The case notes of 39 patients diagnosed with posttraumatic and postoperative endophthalmitis between May 2006 and April 2007 were analyzed and clinical characteristics obtained were documented and tabulated Results During the study period, 2474 patients were admitted in both the male and female wards. Of these, 39 (1.6%) had endophthalmitis due to surgical and traumatic complications. In all, 6 (12.4%) patients had evisceration, while 21 (53.8%) patients who had topical antibiotics consisting of ofloxacin, 0.1% corticosteroids, fortified cetazoline and 1% atropine along with intravitreal antibiotics, a combination of 0.1mg vancomycin and 0.4mg amikacin, were discharged home with a visual acuity of counting fingers to light perception. Conclusion Endophthalmitis is a serious ocular complication of open globe injury and intraocular surgery. The frequency in this center has been noted to be very high as compared to other places.

1001514,"Chilika Lagoon (or lake) is located along the east coast of India and it is the country’s largest marine appended brackish water body. The lagoon was declared a Ramsar site in 1981, and it is recognized as one of the most significant hotspots for aquatic biodiversity in Asia. The lagoon supports a “freshwater” population of Irrawaddy dolphins Orcaella brevirostris that appears to be isolated from coastal marine waters. Based on direct count surveys conducted in 2003-2006 the population size was estimated to be 85 individuals (SD= 18.5, range= 62-98), distributed primarily (65%) in the outer channel (13 km2 and 30 km2 of habitat during low and high tides, respectively) with the remaining population inhabiting the central and southern sectors (178 km2 of habitat). The main threats to the population are from entanglement in fishing gears and collisions with mechanized boats. Research projects initiated by the Chilika Development Authority in 2002 and the School of Tropical Environment Studies and Geography at James Cook University (JCU) in 2004 focus on investigating the distribution and abundance of Irrawaddy dolphins, the factors that threaten their survival, and the perceptions of local people towards the animals. This information will be used to develop a long-term, participatory management plan that will include training boat operators on safe conduct around dolphins and increasing participation of lagoon stakeholders in the conservation process.

1001518,"The Late Cretaceous Parh Group basalts of northeastern Balochistan, Pakistan, crop out in a northeast-trending linear belt of more than 300 km, from Kach in the southwest to Waziristan Northwest Frontier Province in the northeast. The base of the Parh Group volcanic rocks generally consists of pillow basalt, grading upward into volcanic agglomerate, breccia, and tuff. Cherty limestone is associated with both the pillow basalts and the agglomerates. The volcanic rocks in the Parh Group are predominantly alkali olivine basalt, and have lesser olivine tholeiite and very minor quartz tholeiite. With the exception of one quartz tholeiite unit, which has a midocean ridge basalt composition, the Parh Group basalts have whole-rock major and trace element compositions similar to those of hotspot-related oceanic-island basalts of the Southern Hemisphere, such as Reunion and Tristan Da Cunha. The compositions of the Parh Group volcanic rocks and their geological setting suggest that the source for the volcanic rocks was oceanic islands on the continental shelf or slope along the boundary between the Indo-Pakistan plate and the Tethys sea, before they were thrust into their present position in the India-Eurasia suture. The ages of the Parh Group volcanics precede and slightly overlap those of the nearby Deccan Traps, suggesting that they represent the earliest magmas generated from the rising Reunion hotspot plume, which would have been below the Tethyan ocean floor before the main pulse of Deccan volcanism.

Herbs and spices have offered an excellent, important and useful source of antimicrobial agents against many pathological infections. In the current study, the antimicrobial potency of fresh, naturally and commercial dried Allium sativum and Zingiber officinale extracts had been investigated against seven local clinical bacterial isolates such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Serratia marcesnces by the agar disc diffusion method. All tested pathogens except P. aeruginosa and E. coli were most susceptible to ethanolic and methanolic extracts of A. sativum. Similarly, chloroform and diethyl ether extracts of Z. officinale showed a greater zone of inhibition of tested pathogens except for P. aeruginosa and E. coli. We found that all extracts of A. sativum and Z. officinale have a strong antibacterial effect compared to recommended standard antibiotics through activity index.

1001535,"In this paper, we propose a routing protocol AVN-AHH-VBF for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). Sensor nodes forward data packets in multi-hop fashion within a virtual pipeline. As nodes outside pipeline do not forward data packets, thus, flooding is avoided in the network. Mitigating flooding in network, in turn, decreases energy consumption and improves delivery ratio. Moreover, on each hop, forwarding towards void region of the network is avoided with the help of two hop information. Avoiding void hole on each hop reduces number of transmissions for a data packet, for which route to sink does not exist. Thus, energy wastage by each dropped packet is reduced. In addition, taking the benefit of broadcast nature of the network, best forwarder (non-void) is selected from the transmission range of a node.

1001550,"Basel III is the latest global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy and liquidity. It was introduced mainly to prevent a repeat of the recent financial crises by taking into account various points in the Basel II agreement and strengthening them. Compliance with these international rules has become even more important in today’s recessive economy and many Islamic banks, although comprise a small sector of the worldwide banking industry, are already beginning to incorporate these guidelines into their operations. Following the latest guidelines means that banks, both Islamic and conventional, will have new costs and requirements to consider.This paper examines the effects of these regulations on Islamic banks worldwide. It shows the different aspects of the Basel III agreement and its implications on the Islamic Banking Sector. It considers the costs of changes that banks will have to make to their financial system in order to meet the new Basel requirements.

Sorghum grain was treated with water and dried. Seven isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets were prepared, using raw and treated sorghum, and designated diets A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Diet A, containing 0% sorghum, was kept as control. In diets B, C and D, raw sorghum was used at levels of 10%, 20% and 30%, respectively, while in diets E, F and G, treated sorghum was used at the same levels. Two hundred and ten day-old chicks were randomly divided into 21 experimental units of 10 chicks each. These experimental units were randomly allocated to seven treatments. It was observed that water treatment reduced the tannin contents of sorghum. Birds fed diets A, E and F showed the best weight gains, and diet G showed a better weight gain than diets B, C and D. The best feed efficiency was observed in chicks fed diets with treated sorghum compared with those fed raw sorghum. There was no significant effect of treated or raw sorghum on the weight of the internal organs.

1001614,An Acousto-Optic Gyroscope (AOG) consisting of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) embedded into two inherently matched piezoelectric SAW resonators sharing the same cavity is presented. This constitutes the first demonstration of a MEMS strain-based optomechanical gyroscope that uses refractive index change due to the acousto-optic effect rather than conventional displacement sensing. This first prototype integrates acoustic and photonic components on the same lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) substrate and showcases how optical detection can provide greater stability compared to acousto-electric transduction. This approach enables the development of a new class of MEMS-based gyroscopes that combines the advantages of both conventional MEMS and optical gyroscopes.,Ashraf Mahmoud and Mohamed Mahmoud and Lutong Cai and MSI Khan and James A Bain and Tamal Mukherjee and Gianluca Piazza,8,3196860762467781242,,,241-244,IEEE,Acousto-optic gyroscope,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8346529/,,2018,/scholar?cites=3196860762467781242,oZB5st8AAAAJ:XUvXOeBm_78C

The process was optimized by studying the decomposition of methidathion pesticide at different frequencies, different ultrasonic wave amplitudes, pH and concentrations of the solutions. It was shown that the rate of sonochemical decomposition was directly linked to the OH availability in the solution. The degradation was more efficient for the higher frequency because the rates of OH formation in water saturated with air were more at higher frequency. It was observed that higher the ultrasonic frequency, higher was the energy consumption. This problem of higher energy consumption was resolved by increasing the concentration of H 2 O 2.

Observations were made on seed germination and inhibition, meiotic chromosomal behaviour and aberrations, pollen fertility and in vitro germination to understand the mutagenic course of action and the phenotypic expression that follows form the induced bio-cytological instability of the genome. Data on percent seed germination showed higher diminution in EMS compared to SA and an intra-treatment variation was observed in SA while reduction was linear in EMS doses. Microscopic inspection on meiotic cycle of the flower bud demonstrated that an assortment of chromosomal abnormalities was induced due to mutagenic treatments, relatively higher in EMS and the aberration frequency had direct relationship with mutagen doses. Pollen quality estimation from fertility and viability test revealed the degree of bio-physiological damages caused on which reproductive outcome depends and was found to be negatively correlated with cytological aberrations. The investigation on total aberration frequency percentage per treatment and percent inhibition confirmed the higher sensitivity of the genotype towards EMS over SA at the concentrations used in the experiment.

The use of nanomaterials with graphene as a biocompatible agent has increased due to an uptick in dedication from biomedical investigators. Here, GO-ZnO was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), and Raman spectroscopy for structural, morphological, and elemental analysis. The toxic extent of GO-ZnO was noted by a methyl-thiazole-tetrazolium (MTT), while cellular morphology was observed towards the MCF-7 cells using an inverted microscope at magnification 40×. The cytotoxic effect of GO-ZnO investigated the cell viability reduction in a dose-dependent manner, as well as prompted the cell demise/destruction in an apoptotic way. Moreover, statistical analysis was performed on the experimental outcomes, with p-values< 0.05 kept as significant to elucidate the results. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) demonstrated the potential applicability of graphene in tumor treatment. These key results attest to the efficacy of GO-ZnO nanocomposites as a substantial candidate for breast malignancy treatment.

1001767,"Gibberellic acid (GA3), a plant growth regulator is commonly used for berry enlargement in grapes. Flame seedless grapes vines, grown at NARC, Islamabad, were sprayed at bloom and fruit set (just after berry shatter) with GA3, at the concentration of 15ppm, 20pp and 25ppm. For each treatment, GA3 was applied twice with the first spray at 80% blooming and second spray a week later just at fruit set. Water was sprayed to serve as a control. Average cluster and berry weight of sprayed vines increased significantly over the non-sprayed vines and the largest cluster weight depicted as fruit yield per vine (344.22 g) was found in the treatment with highest concentration of GA3 (25ppm). Maximum berry weight, width, length and TSS ie 2.82 g, 1.79 cm, 1.85 cm and 19.00% respectively, were recorded at 25ppm. Statistical differences were observed for cluster weight, berry weight, berry width, length and TSS with GA3 at 15ppm and 20ppm.

1001768,"Elemental Mercury is the main ingredient in dental amalgams and in plasma-derived medicinal products and in other many medicines, but mercury is a neurotoxin and can harm human health if exposed. Thus, it is interesting to study the effect of mercurric chloride on the glutathione (GSH). The effect of mercuric chloride on the chemical status of the glutathione (GSH) in the whole blood has been studied using UV Spectrophotometer by using Ellman’s method. The effect of mercurric chloride on the chemical status of glutathione (GSH) was checked in whole blood with the passage of time. It was found that there is a profound effect of decreasing the concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) in whole blood, as the time has passed. The decrease in the glutathione level was dependent on concentration and time of interaction dependent, probably, due to oxidation of glutathione (GSH) to corresponding disulphide (GSSG). In this paper, the effect of mercuric chloride on thiol/GSH level was discussed in vitro, which in principal may present a model of in vivo reaction. This study can also help in a way to achieve the idea that the acute toxicity of the metal can be neutralized by the reduced glutathione (GSH).",M Farid Khan and Haroon Khan and Hashmatullah Khan and Rehan Z Paracha and Gul Majid Khan,6,17044667080862642180,Jordan Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences,1,22-30,,Effect of mercuric chloride on glutathione (GSH) level in plasma and cytosolic fraction of human blood,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gul_Majid_Khan/publication/234013614_Effect_of_Mercuric_Chloride_on_Glutathione_GSH_level_in_Plasma_and_Cytosolic_Fraction_of_Human_Blood/links/02bfe50e5399181483000000.pdf,2,2009,/scholar?cites=17044667080862642180,oZB5st8AAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC

Due to polders, tides deposited sediment in the riverbeds rather than the floodplains, which halted the natural flow of the rivers and lead to chronic waterlogging. Later, the waterlogging problem was solved by an innovative concept, tidal river management (TRM). However, the TRM operation was not fully effective and successful due to technical, social, and institutional limitations. In this study, the history of coastal borders, the adverse impact of borders, the genesis of TRM, and the problems in TRM operation are discussed.

It has also presented a modern and positive image of Islam and has tried to reintegrate Islam with the rest of the world. Moreover, it has succeeded in initiating inter-faith and inter-cultural dialogue in Turkey and has succeeded to a large extent in creating tolerance and harmony among Turkey’s diverse ethnic, political and religious groups.

Pure and doped ZnO thin films have been subjected of vast attention due to their significant technological applications such as blue/UV LED’s, soler cell, ultra violet nano-lasers, gas sensors, piezoelectric materials, spintronic and optoelectronic devices [2-10]. A variety of techniques have been used for the preparation of ZnO thin films, the properties of grown thin films and interface depends on the deposition process and deposition parameters. These techniques include pulsed laser deposition, magnetron sputtering thermal sputtering, magnetron sputtering, sol gel, chemical bath deposition, Molecular Beam Epitaxy, electro-deposition etc.[11-17]. Out of these used Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique to synthesize high quality thin films [18].Ion irradiation is a unique post deposition technique to modify structural, optical and electrical properties of thin films, when intense interaction of incident ions with the target atoms. Ion irradiation can create new defects and anneal out preexisting defects in the same material [19]. The incorporation of impurities (Co, Ni, Fe, Au, etc.) is key towards controlling the conductivity in ZnO, it has been postulated that the unintentional n-type conductivity in ZnO is caused by the presence of oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials [20]. ZnO has been extensively studied using computational techniques such as density functional theory to unveil the underlying physics.

1001816,This paper reports theoretical investigation of birefringence in a chiral medium for the creation of temporal cloaking. The chiral medium splits the input probe beam into left/right circular polarized beams. These left/right circular polarized beams are then controlled and modified within the chiral medium. The left circular polarized beam delays by 24 ns whereas the right circular polarized beam advances by− 23 ns at a control field of rabbi frequency . This opens a 47 ns time gap for temporal cloaking to hide information without noise corruption and energy loss. The results have potential applications in communication devices for secure propagation of light pulse.,Humayun Khan and Muhammad Haneef,5,1157559443935073515,Laser Physics,5,055201,IOP Publishing,"Birefringence in a chiral medium, via temporal cloaking",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1555-6611/aa658f/meta,27,2017,/scholar?cites=1157559443935073515,oZB5st8AAAAJ:fveVehIkgekC

Bijoypur clay mainly consists of kaolinite clay mineral and it was modified with the dodecyl amine to make it organophilic. Morphology and properties of the composites (different weight ratio of MC and CHT) have been studied and compared with those of pure CHT and MC. Purification and modification of Bijoypur clay were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. The fabrication of CHT-MC composites was confirmed by FTIR analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) were used to investigate the thermal stability of the composites.

Three generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity models were applied: GARCH (1, 1) for various volatility dynamics; EGARCH for asymmetric and leverage effect and GARCH-M for pricing of risk. The outcomes of the study are as follows: first, the volatility shocks are quite persistent but with varying degrees across the sectors. Both the ARCH effect (short-term effect) and GARCH effect (long-term effect) play their role in generating conditional future stock returns volatility. Further, overall the volatility process is mean reverting; however, the speed of mean reversion varies across the sectors.

Ovotransferrin was extracted from egg white using its metal (iron) binding properties. In the present study, eggs from two different sources were used (fresh local eggs from domestic household source and poultry eggs from shops) to compare the results and Response Surface Methodology was used for the experiment design and data analysis. The following extraction conditions were optimized so as to maximize the yield of ovotransferrin from egg white: ethanol % (v/v) and pH and volume (mL) of 25 mM FeCl3/50 mL of egg white. A maximum yield of ~85 ± 2.5% was obtained near the optimum extraction conditions. The yield was calculated based on the theoretical value (934 mg) of ovotransferrin in 100 mL of 1.5x diluted egg white solution.

1001858,"Using research crops of wheat from traditional wheat-producing areas of Bangladesh to understand how and why yields vary, this chapter identifies crop parameters and farm-management approaches that are likely to be needed in the southern and coastal zones of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)-funded project. It defines the potential timing and width of the cropping window for wheat and describes how and why yield changes as crops are moved within that window. By comparing crops from Dinajpur in the north and Jessore in the south, it explains how temperature and radiation at different stages of crop growth can alter yield and its components and suggests that planting dates should be avoided that have a high risk of exposing the crop to low radiation or long-duration fogs during the immediate pre-anthesis phase. It sets some simple crop-development targets needed to achieve high yields. The safest time for planting to achieve a good crop in the north is late November to early December, in part because this gives the longest crop duration to anthesis while still starting the grain-filling phase in relatively cool conditions. This gives 105–110-day crops. In the south (Jessore) this reduces to 90–95-day crops because of higher maximum temperatures in winter and because varietal heat-sum accumulations to anthesis are unchanged by location at 1,300 Cd> 0 Cd. This means that, from equivalent planting dates, Jessore commences grain filling earlier than in the north, resulting in grain filling proceeding over equivalent temperatures at the two locations.

Our study was undertaken to assess the risk of hemorrhagic complications following use of eptifibatide in patients undergoing rescue PTCA/stenting following failed thrombolysis. Clinical records of 43 consecutive patients (53% males) who received eptifibatide during rescue PTCA/stenting following full-dose fibrinolytic therapy were reviewed. Data were collected for: timing of rescue PTCA following fibrinolytic use; concomitant use of other antiplatelet agents; hospital length of stay; in-hospital mortality; and incidence of bleeding complications. Bleeding complications were categorized as major or minor according to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) study group criteria. Overall bleeding complications developed in 13 patients (30%), with 4 patients (9%) experiencing major bleeding. Univariate predictors of major bleeding complications were: older age; female sex; lower baseline platelet count; and time to initiation of eptifibatide following failed thrombolysis.

1001880,"Objective: To evaluate the results of T4, TSH analysis and pattern of presentation in babies born at our hospital.Method: We retrospectively reviewed, the data collected from T4, TSH screening on all babies delivered at our Hospital, where the blood was drawn within the first 4 days of life. Period under evaluation was from October 1995 to October 1998. Shifa Reference values were used.Results: Blood sample were collected from 997 babies within 4 days of birth. Nine hundred and forty nine (95.2%) were evaluated after 24 hours, and 48 (4.8%) in less than 24 hours of age. A high TSH was reported on 166 (16.8%) babies and a low T4 was reported on 78 (7.9%) babies. Statistical analysis showed a similar sensitivity for T4 and TSH (100%) but a higher specificity for T4 (93.1%) as compared to TSH (86%). A high TSH with a low T4 was reported in 5 (0.5%) babies out of which 1 case was confirmed as congenital hypothyroidism requiring permanent thyroxin replacement and One case manifested a picture consistent with transient hypothyroidism. A low TSH with a low 14 was seen in 2 cases, however, they were all premature babies on antibiotics. Conclusion: Congenital hypothyroidism may be more frequent in our population and for the purpose of screening babies T4 values would carry a higher positive predictive value than TSH. Combining T4 TSH assays would however reduce the call back rate quite significantly but may prove to be a bit more expensive (JPMA 52: 58, 2002).",Y Najam and M Khan and F Illahi and A Alam,5,9374983018946493492,JOURNAL-PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,2,58-61,JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,Neonatal thyroid screening-the Shifa experience,https://www.jpma.org.pk/PdfDownload/2131.pdf,52,2002,/scholar?cites=9374983018946493492,oZB5st8AAAAJ:NGoJ35N4lvkC

It is presumed that this figure more or less reflects the overall trend in the country, but obviously needs more substantiating evidence. Over the last decade, our understanding of the pathogenesis of asthma has undergone important changes. The concept of asthma as an inflammatory disease of the airway has gained considerable support. The association between allergy and asthma has also become increasingly clear 3. Moreover, asthma management has undergone drastic changes with the advent of inhaled beta-agonists and steroids. As a result, the use of conventional drugs like theophylline has declined considerably. There is increasing emphasis on the shared management with patient and the family.

Undiscovered recoverable resources are those resources which can be extracted economically under existing technology and price/cost relationships assuming normal short-term technologic growth. However, in offshore Alaska, these quantities include some resources which are recoverable only if technology permits their exploitation beneath Arctic pack ice-a condition not yet met. The assessed resources occupy the shaded area on the resource classification chart (figure 1) as defined in 1980 by the USGS and US Bureau of Mines. Undiscovered recoverable resources do not include quantities which may yet be found in new pays or extensions of existing fields. Crude oil is a natural mixture of hydrocarbons occurring underground in a liquid state in reservoir rock and remaining in a liquid state as it is produced from wells.

The hormonal response was measured as LH-stimulated accumulation of cyclic AMP in isolated, whole corpora lutea and, in some experiments, as LH stimulated luteal adenylate cyclase activity. Injection of hCG produced a complete desensitization (refractoriness) of very long duration (4–5 days) as has earlier been found in rats with heavily luteinized ovaries, while the injection of LH in equivalent doses, produced only a partial desensitization of much shorter duration (12–48 h).

The method encounters into local optima and insufficient diversity at the later phase of optimization. To address this type of issue, a new methodology is used to select the fittest particle, and a novel mutation mechanism is introduced, in which a mutation technique is applied on the global best particle to avoid the population from assembling and facilitating the individual to avoid the local optimum easily. In addition, a parameter updating strategy is proposed, which facilitates the optimizer to maintain a good balance between local and global searches.

Simulation results give a clear understanding that stationary mode scenario is energy efficient in terms of sensor deployment as the nodes are no more in mobile state and there are no other factors which lead to energy depletion.

1001940,"Wheat, the second most important cereal crop after rice, plays an important role in food and nutritional security worldwide. Wheat rusts, viz. black or stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici), brown or leaf rust (P. triticina) and yellow or stripe rust (P. striiformis), capable of spreading aerially over long distances, are highly variable and devastating pathogens. They evolve quickly to form new pathotypes/races, render resistant varieties susceptible and pose a serious threat to wheat production in different parts of the world1. Stem rust, also called ‘polio of agriculture’, has caused several severe epidemics in the past throughout the world. Developing rust-resistant varieties has been a continuous exercise over the years. One of the achievements of the green revolution of the 1960s was to reduce yield losses due to wheat rusts, as many resistance genes introduced in wheat during that period conferred resistance to most of the rust pathotypes of that time. A number of rust-resistant sources, including alien ones have been used to combat wheat stem rust. Introduction of rye (Secale cereale L.) gene (1B/1R translocation or substitution) into bread wheat2, 3, which carries Lr26/Sr31/Yr9, completely linked resistance gene has not only contributed 12–20% yield jump, but also imparted resistance to major biotic and abiotic stresses4.

1001948,"Signal detection and its assessment is the most important aspect in pharmacovigilance which plays a key role in ensuring that patients receive safe drugs. For detection of adverse drug reactions, clinical trials usually provide limited information as they are conducted under strictly controlled conditions. Some of the adverse drug reactions can be detected only after long term use in larger population and in specific patient groups due to specific concomitant medications or disease. The detection of unknown and unexpected safety signals as early as possible from post marketing data is one of the major challenge of pharmacovigilance. The current method of detecting a signal is predominantly based on spontaneous reporting, which is mainly helpful in detecting type B adverse effects and unusual type A adverse effects. Other sources of signals detection are prescription event monitoring, case control surveillance and follow up studies. Signal assessment is mainly performed by using Upsala Monitoring scale & Naranjo scale of probability to analyze the cause and effect analysis.

Objectives: Response to experimental pain varies with the subject’s gender, menstrual phase (in case of female subjects), and the race of the subject. We have investigated the variation of response to experimental pain with education, occupation, and economic status of the subject to establish if psychological distress due to low socioeconomic status leads to increased pain perception. Methodology: 156 Healthy male subjects of North Indian population (age group 25-40 years) were classified on the basis of their education, occupation, and monthly income.

1001982,"Objective: The aim of this study was to compare retro grade urethrography (RUG) and sonourethrography (SUG) for assessment of urethral strictures and to evaluate whether RUG underestimates stricture length, as has been reported.Study design: Quasiexperimental study.Place and Time of Study: The study was performed in the department of Radiology PNS Shifa Karachi from January 2004 till December 2004.Patients and Methods: Forty male patients diagnosed with anterior urethral stricture were assessed for presence of strictures and their length by conventional contrast urethrography and sonourethrography. Contrast urethrography was carried out by retrograde injection of Urograffin 76% under fluoroscopic guidance. Sonourethrography was done with a 7.5 MHz small parts transducer. Stricture lengths were recorded and compared.Results: Analysis of the results showed that the estimation of stricture length measured by contrast urethrography was under-estimated as compared to sonourethrography. The difference between the two tests was significant (P< 0.001) and the correlation coefficient was poor (r= 0.493). When the strictures were grouped into penile and bulbar anatomical locations the results remained highly significant in the bulbar region (P= 0.0001) however no significant difference was found in the estimated length for penile strictures (P= 0.25).Conclusion: Sonourethrography is a good adjunct investigation before definitive surgical therapy particularly in the bulbar region where conventional contrast urethrography was shown to underestimate stricture length significantly.",Muhammad Babar Khan and Abdul Ghaffar and Tariq Mahmood,4,6218002132367746769,Pakistan Armed Forces Medical Journal,3,300-305,,Role Of Sonourethrography In Evaluation Of Anterior Urethral Stricture And Its Comparison With Retrograde Urethrography,http://www.pafmj.org/index.php/PAFMJ/article/view/1483,56,2006,/scholar?cites=6218002132367746769,oZB5st8AAAAJ:dT4-KZ621vcC

1001987,"[en] An open pit mining operation consists of mining processing and refining stages. The mining stage is responsible for provision of required amount of ore of pre-defined grade to the processing plant. The heterogeneity in the ore grade in various parts of the deposit leads to the definition of cutoff grade. The material below cutoff grade is sent to the stockpiles for utilization in later years when it becomes economical. The cutoff grade optimization theory maximizes the Net Present Value (NPV) of a mixing operation with a declining effect as the deposit leads toward exhaustion. This declining effect of NPV defines dynamic cutoff grades ie higher cutoff grades in the early years of mine life and lower cutoff grades in the later years. However, this precisely defines the amount and grade of material sent to the stockpile for processing in the later years. The management ie supply of material from the mine to stockpile and from the stockpile to the processing plant is an issue that is addressed in this paper by developing a cutoff grade optimization algorithm with option to stockpile. The benefits of methodology are elaborated in a case study.(author)",MW Ali and MN Khan,4,10700509857126819970,Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences (Peshawar),1,51-56,,Management of open pit mining operations with ore stockpiles,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:36030160,23,2004,/scholar?cites=10700509857126819970,oZB5st8AAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC

1001988,This study was conducted to detect the prevalence of depression in medical inpatients staying for more than one week in the hospital and to assess the possible role of depression in prolongingthe stay of the patients in the hospital. Two hundred and ninety eight patients with over a week stay in the hospital were screened for probable depression during three months with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [Depression Subscale] and consequently they were assessed by two psychiatrists twice at 1 week interval with clinical interview and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Final diagnosis was made by using the ICD-30 diagnostic criteria. Depression in some form was detected in 39.26% of the total patients including major depression in 9.73% of the total patients. The hospital stay of the patients showed significant relation with depression. The substantial prevalence of depression with its significant association with longer hospital stay in medical inpatients requires greater cognizance and attention by simple screening instruments like HADS and subsequent liaison with the psychiatrist in selected cases for its appropriate management. This may help in improving the patient's physical and psychological health and reducing the hospital stay and costs. Future sound methodological studies are needed to explore the possible therapeutic and economic benefits of screening the patients in the medical wards for depression,Shahid Rasheed and Muhammad Amin Khan and Badshah Khan and Mohammad Younus Khan,4,2160883165089447786,Armed Forces Med.

1002007,"Two aspects of the Intrinsic control of the function of the luteal cell will be discussed: 1) the cellular mechanisms controlling the development and function of the young corpus luteum (CL), and 2) the cellular changes produced in luteal cells by prostaglandin (PGF2a). Both aspects will be discussed on the basis of experiments on the pseudopregnant rat CL. Objections might be raised against using this particular type of CL as a model, but there is reason to believe that the basic cellular mechanisms controlling the function of the luteal cell are the same in all species and In all types of CL.Development and function of the young corpus luteum (CL) Luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin are the two important extrinsic factors controlling the formation and function of the young CL of the rat. The mechanism of the LH-effect was discussed at the last International Congress of Endocrinology (1972) by Cornelia Charming when she presented some of her Important experiments on granulosa cell cultures (1). She suggested a scheme to explain the Iuteinization of the granulosa cells and thus also the formation and function of the young CL. In this scheme it was assumed that the receptors of the granulosa cells are all saturated with LH at ovulation, and that the granulosa cells after ovulation carry bound LH with them. Furthermore, it is this receptor bound LH which stimulates the adenylate cyclase of the cells, thereby producing cyclic AMP (cAMP) which is assumed to mediate all the LH-effects. The implication of this theory is thus 1) that the cAMP level of the cells is the critical factor for both Iuteinization and progesterone synthesis, and 2) that the LH surge …",K Ahren and H Herlitz and PO Janson and MI Khan and S Rosberg,4,5303070940339168676,Endocrinology,,324-9,,Control of luteal function,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5303070940339168676&hl=en&oi=scholarr,1,1976,/scholar?cites=5303070940339168676,oZB5st8AAAAJ:tCoNjB6AT50C

1002011,"In this paper, calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) whisker as a fiber reinforcement is mixed with steel and PVA fiber to form a multiscale hybrid fiber reinforced cementitious composites (MHFRCC). ASTM standard and post-crack strength techniques are performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of MHFRCC. The 1.25% long steel fiber, 0.55% short PVA fiber and 2.0% CaCO 3 whisker specimens showed the best flexural behavior before L/600 deflection. However, 1.5% long steel fiber, 0.4% long PVA fiber and 1.0% CaCO 3 whisker specimens presented better crack resistance after L/600 deflection. It is revealed that flexural parameters increase as comprehensive reinforcing index increase. The result showed that the CaCO 3 whisker and short PVA fiber provided crack resistance effect at micro-scale and mainly play a dominate role in inhibiting micro-cracking.

1002012,"The recommender systems are deployed on the Web for reducing cognitive overload. It uses different parameters, such as profile information, feedbacks, history, etc., as input and recommends items to a user or group of users. Such parameters are easy to predict and calculate for a single user on a personalized device, such as a personal computer or smartphone. However, watching the Web contents on a smart TV is significantly different from other connected devices. For example, the smart TV is a multi-user, lean-back supported device, and normally enjoyed in groups. Moreover, the performance of a recommender system is questionable due to the dynamic interests of groups in front of a smart TV. This paper discussed in detail the existing recommender system approaches in the context of smart TV environment. Moreover, it highlights the issues and challenges in existing recommendations for smart TV viewer (s) and presents some research opportunities to cope with these issues. The paper further reports some overlooked factors that affect the recommendation process on a smart TV. A subjective study of viewers’ watching behavior on a smart TV is also presented for validating these factors. Results show that apart from all technological advancement, the viewers are enjoying smart TV as a passive, lean-back device, and mostly used for watching live channels and videos on the big screen. Furthermore, in most households, smart TV is enjoyed in groups as a shared device which creates hurdles in personalized recommendations.

The present study was conducted to determine habitat use and feeding preference of urial in Gilgit Baltistan. Current study is the first and only detailed study about the habitat and feeding ecology of these wild sheep in Pakistan. The study provides baseline data about the study topic which will help conservation management of the species in the area. The habitat use of urial was determined on the basis of direct or indirect evidence (eg animal sightings, fecal pallets and hairs) in different habitats. Information on food consumption was collected by using scan sampling technique and also collected from local people, hunters and shepherds (n= 78). During scan sampling, focused feeding animals were observed with the help of a telescope and spotting scope. Ladakh urial preferred montane dry sub-tropical scrub zone habitat with 41.87% evidences of its presence followed by alpine meadows/alpine scrub zone (21.14%), sub-alpine scrub zone (13.41%), and dry temperate coniferous forests (8.54%).

This study reports the extraction of niobium pentoxide from pyrochlore ore occurring in Sillai Patai, KPK, Pakistan. It is difficult to recover niobium pentoxide from Pakistani ore due to its low concentration. Niobium pentoxide is an important material used in manufacturing industries for different purposes. Most of the commercially employed extraction processes are associated with serious environmental impacts and are not efficient in extracting niobium pentoxide from low concentration pyrochlore. Alkali potash has been used for separation and purification of niobium pentoxide because it is efficient and an environmentally friendly process. The leaching of niobium pentoxide is carried out in a batch reactor using alkali potash as a leachant. Various process parameters, including ore particle size, reaction temperature, reaction time and alkali to ore mass ratio, were examined statistically during the leaching process. It was observed that reaction temperature and ore particle size were more significant compared to other parameters.

1002047,"Chikungunya is an infection caused by the Chikungunya virus. Chikungunya is an arthropod-borne virus transmitted mainly by Aedesspecies mosquitoes. Only the female are infective since they need blood meals for egg formation. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alpha virus from the Togaviridae family, which is transmitted by two types of mosquitos: Aedesalbopictus and Aedesaegypti. They mainly bite during the day, and causes epidemic tropical and subtropical countries. CHIKV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of about 11.8 kb. There are three main genotypes, West African, Central/East African (C/EA), and Asian, the names reflecting the initial geo-graphic restriction of each type. The disease was first identified in 1952 in Tanzania. The term is from the Kimakonde language and means"" to become contorted"". This disease was first detected in 1952 in Makonde Plateau, which is the border area between Mozambique and Tanzania. This name of Chikungunya actually meant “that which bends up” which was derived from a Makonde word. The virus may circulate within a number of animals including birds and rodents. Chikungunya is an infection that is carried by a human which is transmitted between humans by mosquitoes. This was in reference to the stooped posture of the patient as a result of the joint pain which was a symptom of this disease.

1002049,"The rapid deployment of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) in power systems globally is leading to Big Data challenges. New high performance computing techniques are now required to process an ever increasing volume of data from PMUs. To that extent the Hadoop framework, an open source implementation of the MapReduce computing model, is gaining momentum for Big Data analytics in smart grid applications. However, Hadoop has over 190 configuration parameters, which can have a significant impact on the performance of the Hadoop framework. This paper presents an Enhanced Parallel Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (EPDFA) algorithm for scalable analytics on massive volumes of PMU data. The novel EPDFA algorithm builds on an enhanced Hadoop platform whose configuration parameters are optimized by Gene Expression Programming.

1002052,"Meloidogyne spp., the root-knot nematodes are obligate endo-parasites and perfect examples of highly adapted root parasitism. They are one of the major constraints in the production of field and plantation crops throughout the tropical, subtropical and temperate countries. These nematodes enjoy a guaranteed continuous supply of food and water from the host and protection within the gall for the females and their progeny. The damage to plants is due largely to the disruption of vascular tissues and extensive hypertrophy and hyperplasia of root cells. Besides the knotted roots, an infected plant shows poor growth, unthriftiness and general wilt symptoms the damage is aggravated by the parasites interaction with other pathogens such as fungi and bacteria (Siddiqi, 1986).A prime example of how a combination of agricultural, environmental, socioeconomic, and policy changes can affect the pest status of a plant-parasitic nematode in the tropics is illustrated by M. graminicola on rice in Southeast Asia.

This is partly caused by poor estrus detection, delayed determination of unsuccessful artificial insemination (AI) and sub-optimal calving to conception interval. Blood levels of progesterone hormone (P4) are a valid indicator of the reproductive status of an animal. Progesterone levels can be used to determine the estrous phase of an animal and also pregnancy status. This study evaluated P4 levels across the reproductive cycle in dairy cattle in Kenya using the whole blood semi quantitative lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) manufactured by Diagnostics for All Company and compared the findings with those by plasma quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blood was collected from 46 animals to establish the P4 profiles at the various stages of the reproductive cycle using ELISA. Subsequently, P4 levels were analyzed by LFIA and ELISA in blood from 100 dairy cattle and the tests compared. The P4 profiles of dairy cattle in the study ranged from 0-10ng/ml. The LFIA test results were scored from 1-3. Progesterone levels with scores of 1 to 2 were recorded in pre-pubertal and follicular phase animals, corresponding to P4 levels ranging from 0.01 to 2.4 ng/ml by ELISA. Non pregnant luteal phase and pregnant animals had higher (P>0.05) LFIA scores of 3 representative of P4 levels ranging from 6 to 10 ng/ml.

1002064,"The development of standards like MPEG-7, MPEG-21 and ID3 tags in MP3 have been recognized from quite some time. It is of great importance in adding descriptions to multimedia content for better organization and retrieval. However, these standards are only suitable for closed-world-multimedia-content where a lot of effort is put in the production stage. Video content on the Web, on the contrary, is of arbitrary nature captured and uploaded in a variety of formats with main aim of sharing quickly and with ease. The advent of Web 2.0 has resulted in the wide availability of different video-sharing applications such as YouTube which have made video as major content on the Web. These web applications not only allow users to browse and search multimedia content but also add comments and annotations that provide an opportunity to store the miscellaneous information and thought-provoking statements from users all over the world. However, these annotations have not been exploited to their fullest for the purpose of searching and retrieval. Video indexing, retrieval, ranking and recommendations will become more efficient by making these annotations machine-processable. Moreover, associating annotations with a specific region or temporal duration of a video will result in fast retrieval of required video scene. This paper investigates state-of-the-art desktop and Web-based-multimediaannotation-systems focusing on their distinct characteristics, strengths and limitations. Different annotation frameworks, annotation models and multimedia ontologies are also evaluated.",Mumtaz Khan and Shah Khusro and Irfan Ullah,3,17729309264315542963,International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security,3,198,LJS Publishing,On Annotation of Video Content for Multimedia Retrieval and Sharing,http://www.academia.edu/download/44441513/26_Paper_29021609_IJCSIS_Camera_Ready_pp._198-218.pdf,14,2016,/scholar?cites=17729309264315542963,oZB5st8AAAAJ:Uha2Xg-6WXIC

1002065,"Aim: M. elengi L.(Sapotaceae) has been used for rheumatism and pain. However the floral part of this plant is not scientifically explored yet for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. The present study is an endeavor to evaluate anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of methanolic extracts of flower and leaves (MFE and MLE) of Mimusops elengi.Study Design: Assessment of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity.Methodology: Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in albino species of rats by using carrageenan induced paw edema, where as in vitro antioxidant activity was also performed by DPPH radical and nitric oxide scavenging method.Results: The anti-inflammatory activity of methanolic extract of M. elengi (MFE, MLE) against carrageenan induced paw edema in albino rats at a dose of (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) showed that the extracts have significant (P< 0.01; P< 0.001) effect on inflammation and markedly reduced the swelling. At a concentration of 20 μg/mL, 40 μg/mL, 60 μg/mL, 80 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL (MFE, MLE) extracts, scavenged of DPPH radical. While in nitric oxide scavenging assay, various concentrations of the extracts (10, 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg/mL) of M. elengi showed percentage inhibition in a dose dependent manner. These activities showed by the extracts of M. elengi due to the frequent occurrence of rich phenolic compounds such as, flavonoids, tannins, phenols, terpenoids and saponins.Conclusion: In the light of research it seems close correlation between the powerful antioxidant and significant anti-inflammatory activities of the MFE and MLE.",Hina Zahid and Ghazala H Rizwani and Madiha Khan and Shaukat Khalid,3,2633865463131725852,Journal of Pharmaceutical Research International,,1-10,,Anti-inflammatory and Antioxidant Activities of Mimusops elengi L.,http://www.journaljpri.com/index.php/JPRI/article/view/18769,,2016,/scholar?cites=2633865463131725852,oZB5st8AAAAJ:FVakaZBJmp0C
