The EFGR family is a group of four structurally similar tyrosine kinases (EGFR, HER2/neu, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4) that dimerize on binding with a number of ligands, including EGF and transforming growth factor alpha.

1017096,"Squamous cell lung cancer (SCC) represents an area of unmet need in lung cancer research. For the past several years, therapeutic progress in SCC has lagged behind the now more common non–small cell lung cancer histologic subtype of adenocarcinoma. However, recent efforts to define the complex biology underlying SCC have begun to bear fruit in a multitude of ways, including characterization of previously unknown genomic and signaling pathways, delineation of new, potentially actionable molecular targets, and subsequent development of a large number of agents directed against unique SCC-associated molecular abnormalities. For the first time, SCC-specific prognostic gene signatures and predictive biomarkers of new therapeutic agents are emerging.

1017099,"DISCUSSIONCrizotinib is now approved for the treatment of ALK FISH-positive advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), based on two pivotal studies performed among the FISH-identified population. 1, 2 However, some important shortcomings of the ALK FISH assay have been reported. First, because the splitting of the red (3′) and green (5′) signals can be extremely subtle, false-negative results are sometimes reported. 3 Second, the noninterpretation rate in FISH tests among tumors, which were reported as ALK-positive by IHC analysis was considerably high. 4 ALK IHC was validated as a screening tool before the FISH assay for the detection of ALK rearrangement. The reported concordance rate for ALK positivity between IHC and FISH is consistently high. 4, 5 However, ALK positivity was not reproduced by FISH in some ALK IHC-positive cases. 4, 5 Before our report, the clinical relevance of crizotinib therapy in the ALK IHC-positive and FISH-negative tumors subgroup was not known.We ruled out the possibility in our case that crizotinib showed its effectiveness by affecting the MET or ROS1 pathways by demonstrating no aberrancy of these genes.

The HER2/neu receptor is a member of the ErbB family of signaling-transduction receptors and appears to play a major role in the development of lung cancer as well as many other solid tumors. HER2/neu is overexpressed in 16% to 57% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and studies have shown that HER2/neu overexpression imparts a poor prognosis in both resected and advanced NSCLC, as it does in breast cancer. Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes the HER2/neu protein receptor, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with HER2/neu-positive metastatic breast cancer.

The use of IHC has improved diagnostic accuracy in the classification of lung carcinoma, but the interpretation of IHC results remains challenging in some instances.

1017178,"Introduction: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not recommended for predicting response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) due to conflicting results, all using antibodies detecting EGFR external domain (ED). We tested the predictive value of EGFR protein expression for response to an EGFR TKI with an antibody that detects the intracellular domain (ID) and compared fluorescence-based Automated QUantitative Analysis (AQUA) technology to immunohistochemistry (IHC).Methods: Specimens from 98 gefitinib-treated NSCLC Japanese patients were evaluated by IHC (n = 98 of 98) and AQUA technology (n = 70 of 98).

1017179,"Lung carcinoma development is accompanied by field changes that may have diagnostic significance. We have previously shown the importance of chromosomal aneusomy in lung cancer progression. Here, we tested whether genomic gains in six specific loci, TP63 on 3q28, EGFR on 7p12, MYC on 8q24, 5p15.2, and centromeric regions for chromosomes 3 (CEP3) and 6 (CEP6), may provide further value in the prediction of lung cancer. Bronchial biopsy specimens were obtained by LIFE bronchoscopy from 70 subjects (27 with prevalent lung cancers and 43 individuals without lung cancer). Twenty six biopsies were read as moderate dysplasia, 21 as severe dysplasia and 23 as carcinoma in situ (CIS). Four-micron paraffin sections were submitted to a 4-target FISH assay (LAVysion, Abbott Molecular) and reprobed for TP63 and CEP 3 sequences. Spot counts were obtained in 30–50 nuclei per specimen for each probe. Increased gene copy number in 4 of the 6 probes was associated with increased risk of being diagnosed with lung cancer both in unadjusted analyses (odds ratio = 11, p<0.05) and adjusted for histology grade (odds ratio = 17, p<0.05). The most informative 4 probes were TP63, MYC, CEP3 and CEP6. The combination of these 4 probes offered a sensitivity of 82% for lung cancer and a specificity of 58%. These results indicate that specific cytogenetic alterations present in preinvasive lung lesions are closely associated with the diagnosis of lung cancer and may therefore have value in assessing lung cancer risk.",Pierre P Massion and Yong Zou and Hasmet Uner and Porntip Kiatsimkul and Holly J Wolf and Anna E Baron and Tim Byers and Steinn Jonsson and Stephen Lam and Fred R Hirsch and York E Miller and Wilbur A Franklin and Marileila Varella-Garcia,45,17558653169910408980,PLoS One,6,e5611,Public Library of Science,Recurrent genomic gains in preinvasive lesions as a biomarker of risk for lung cancer,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005611,4,2009,/scholar?cites=17558653169910408980,klVXQ3gAAAAJ:ehoypfNsBj8C

Eleven cell lines were highly sensitive to gefitinib (inhibitor concentration required to give 50% growth inhibition [GI50] < 1 μM), three had intermediate sensitivity (GI50 1–7 μM), and six were resistant (GI50 > 7 μM); an exploratory principal component analysis revealed a separation between the genomic profiles of sensitive and resistant cell lines.

Multiple clinical trials for ICIs have evaluated a predictive value of PD-L1 protein expression in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) by immunohistochemistry (IHC), for which different assays with specific IHC platforms were applied.

1017185,"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. NSCLC accounts for more than 85% of all lung cancers, and the prognosis for advanced-stage disease is typically poor. In recent years, the importance of histologic subtypes of NSCLC has been recognized, and the distinction between squamous and other NSCLC histologic subtypes is now critical to patient management. Squamous cell lung cancer (sqCLC) represents approximately 25% to 30% of NSCLC. The prognosis for patients with advanced NSCLC is poorer for those with sqCLC than for those with adenocarcinoma. This is partly due to a number of clinical characteristics that distinguish sqCLC from other NSCLC histologic subtypes, such as smoking history, comorbid diseases, age, and molecular profile.
