1028000,"Phagocyte-mediated oxidant damage to vascular endothelium is likely involved in various vasculopathies including atherosclerosis and pulmonary leak syndromes such as adult respiratory distress syndrome. We have shown that heme, a hydrophobic iron chelate, is rapidly incorporated into endothelial cells where, after as little as 1 h, it markedly aggravates cytotoxicity engendered by polymorphonuclear leukocyte oxidants or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In contrast, however, if cultured endothelial cells are briefly pulsed with heme and then allowed to incubate for a prolonged period (16 h), the cells become highly resistant to oxidant-mediated injury and to the accumulation of endothelial lipid peroxidation products. This protection is associated with the induction within 4 h of mRNAs for both heme oxygenase and ferritin. After 16 h heme oxygenase and ferritin have increased approximately 50-fold and 10-fold …",Gyorgy Balla and Harry S Jacob and Jozsef Balla and Mark Rosenberg and Karl Nath and Fred Apple and John W Eaton and Gregory M Vercellotti,1284,9189737118699607581,Journal of Biological Chemistry,25,18148-18153,American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Ferritin: a cytoprotective antioxidant strategem of endothelium.,https://www.jbc.org/content/267/25/18148.short,267,1992,/scholar?cites=9189737118699607581,ePh3FuQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C

We show that C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute- phase reactant that markedly increases its serum concentration in response to inflammatory stimuli, induced monocytes to express tissue factor (TF), a potent procoagulant. Purified human CRP in concentrations commonly achieved in vivo during inflammation (10 to 100 micrograms/mL) induced a 75-fold increase in TF procoagulant activity (PCA) of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM), with a parallel increase in TF antigen levels. CRP-induced PCA was completely blocked by a monoclonal antibody against human TF but not by irrelevant murine IgG.

Myoglobin is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of renal failure in rhabdomyolysis. In the glycerol model of this syndrome, we demonstrate that the kidney responds to such inordinate amounts of heme proteins by inducing the heme-degradative enzyme, heme oxygenase, as well as increasing the synthesis of ferritin, the major cellular repository for iron. Prior recruitment of this response with a single preinfusion of hemoglobin prevents kidney failure and drastically reduces mortality (from 100% to 14%).

Deficiency of the heme-catabolizing enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), in both a human patient and transgenic knockout mice leads to an abundance of circulating heme and damage to vascular endothelium.

Hemoglobin, the major oxygen-carrying protein in blood, is the most abundant heme-protein in animals and humans. Hemoglobin consists of four globin subunits (α2β2), with each subunit carrying a heme group. Ferrous (Fe2+) hemoglobin is easily oxidized in circulation to ferric (Fe3+) hemoglobin, which readily releases free hemin. Hemin is hydrophobic and intercalates into cell membranes. Hydrogen peroxide can split the heme ring and release “free” redox-active iron, which catalytically amplifies the production of reactive oxygen species.

Although iron overload and its association with osteoporosis has long been recognized, the pathogenesis and exact role of iron have been undefined. Bone is an active tissue with constant remodeling capacity. Osteoblast (OB) development and maturation are under the influence of core binding factor α‐1 (CBF‐α1), which induces expression of OB‐specific genes, including alkaline phosphatase, an important enzyme in early osteogenesis, and osteocalcin, a noncollagenous protein deposited within the osteoid. This study investigates the mechanism by which iron inhibits human OB activity, which in vivo may lead to decreased mineralization, osteopenia, and osteoporosis.

Iron, in its catalytically active form, can participate in the generation of reactive oxygen species and induce lipid-peroxidation, triggering endothelial activation, smooth muscle cell proliferation and macrophage activation; all of these processes are considered to be proatherogenic. On the other hand, the observation that hemochromatotic patients, affected by life-long iron overload, do not show any increased incidence of atherosclerosis is perceived as the most convincing evidence against the “iron hypothesis”. Epidemiological studies and data from animal models provided conflicting evidences about the role of iron in atherogenesis.

By releasing its heme, methemoglobin can sensitize endothelial cells in a fashion similar to free hemin. Furthermore, prolonged incubation with the endothelium allows methemoglobin to induce heme oxygenase and ferritin and concomitantly to modulate oxidant-mediated cytotoxicity. Methemoglobin but not hemoglobin, metmyoglobin or cytochrome c induces heme oxygenase and ferritin. Heme needs to be released from methemoglobin, since sodium cyanide, haptoglobin, and hemopexin inhibit the induction of these proteins. Neutrophils can oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which can subsequently induce both heme oxygenase and ferritin. We speculate that in shock with disseminated intravascular coagulation, marginated PMNs oxidize hemoglobin to heme-releasing methemoglobin.

1028040,"For decades plaque neovascularization was considered as an innocent feature of advanced atherosclerotic lesions, but nowadays growing evidence suggest that this process triggers plaque progression and vulnerability. Neovascularization is induced mostly by hypoxia, but the involvement of oxidative stress is also established. Because of inappropriate angiogenesis, neovessels are leaky and prone to rupture, leading to the extravasation of red blood cells (RBCs) within the plaque. RBCs, in the highly oxidative environment of the atherosclerotic lesions, tend to lyse quickly. Both RBC membrane and the released hemoglobin (Hb) possess atherogenic activities. Cholesterol content of RBC membrane contributes to lipid deposition and lipid core expansion upon intraplaque hemorrhage. Cell-free Hb is prone to oxidation, and the oxidation products possess pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory activities. Defense and adaptation mechanisms evolved to cope with the deleterious effects of cell free Hb and heme.

Regulation of ferritin occurs through the formation of an iron-sulfur cluster within a cytoplasmic protein, the iron regulatory protein (IP, P) that controls ferritin mRNA translation. Nitric oxide has been shown to inhibit iron-sulfur proteins and is present at vascular sites of inflammation; therefore, we undertook a study to examine the influence of nitric oxide on changes in endothelial cell ferritin content in response to iron exposure, and the subsequent effects on susceptibility to oxidative injury. Iron-loaded endothelial cells (EC) exposed to nitric oxide donors synthesize markedly less ferritin.

1028042,"Oxidized cell-free hemoglobin (Hb), including covalently cross-linked Hb multimers, is present in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Oxidation of Hb produces methemoglobin (                     ) and ferryl hemoglobin (                               ). Ferryl iron is unstable and can return to the                       state by reacting with specific amino acids of the globin chains. In these reactions globin radicals are produced followed by termination reactions yielding covalently cross-linked Hb multimers.  Despite the evanescent nature of the ferryl state, herein we refer to this oxidized Hb as “ferryl Hb.” Our aim in this work was to study formation and biological effects of ferrylHb.  We demonstrate that ferrylHb, like metHb, can release its heme group, leading to sensitization of endothelial cells (ECs) to oxidant-mediated killing and to oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Furthermore, we observed that both oxidized LDL and lipids derived from human atherosclerotic lesions trigger Hb oxidation and subsequent production of covalently cross-linked ferrylHb multimers. Previously we showed that ferrylHb disrupts EC monolayer integrity and induces expression of inflammatory cell adhesion molecules. Here we show that when exposed to ferrylHb, EC monolayers exhibit increased permeability and enhanced monocyte adhesion.  Taken together, interactions between cell-free Hb and atheroma lipids engage in a vicious cycle, amplifying oxidation of plaque lipids and Hb.

Because red cells in the extravascular space tend to lyse quickly, hemoglobin (Hb) is released and is prone to autoxidation producing MetHb. Inorganic and organic peroxides may convert Hb and MetHb to higher oxidation states such as ferrylHb. FerrylHb is not a single chemical entity but is a mixture of globin- and porphyrin-centered radicals and covalently cross-linked Hb multimers. Oxidized Hb species are potent prooxidants caused mainly by heme release from oxidized Hb. Moreover, ferrylHb is a strong proinflammatory agonist that targets vascular endothelial cells. This proinflammatory effect of ferrylHb requires actin polymerization, is characterized by the upregulation of proinflammatory adhesion molecules, and is independent of heme release. Deleterious effects of native Hb are controlled by haptoglobin (Hp) that binds cell-free Hb avidly and facilitates its removal from circulation through the CD163 macrophage scavenger receptor-mediated endocytosis. Under circumstances of Hb oxidation, Hp can prevent heme release from MetHb, but unfortunately the Hp-mediated removal of Hb is severely compromised when Hb is structurally altered such as in ferrylHb allowing deleterious downstream reactions to occur even in the presence of Hp.",Viktória Jeney and John W Eaton and György Balla and József Balla,42,3139816922275840261,Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity,,,Hindawi Publishing Corporation,"Natural history of the bruise: formation, elimination, and biological effects of oxidized hemoglobin",http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/oximed/2013/703571.pdf,2013,2013,/scholar?cites=3139816922275840261,ePh3FuQAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC

Drawing upon our previous observation we posited a pathway for oxidation of plasma hemoglobin in the HO-1-deficient child involving LDL-associated lipid hydroperoxide. In support, LDL-associated lipid hydroperoxide oxidized ferrohemoglobin to methemoglobin–known to readily release its heme moieties–in a dose-dependent manner. Repeated heme exposure of the child’s LDL further increased its lipid hydroperoxide content within min leading to additional cytotoxic effect on endothelium. Both cytotoxicity and HO-1 inducing ability of the oxidized LDL were strongly dependent on its lipid hydroperoxide content. We wondered if cells of the HO-1-deficient patient were prone to oxidative damage arising from heme-mediated oxidation of LDL. Indeed, we found elevated cytotoxicity induced by heme-catalyzed oxidation of LDL in lymphoblastoid cells derived from the HO-1-deficient patient.

All the derivatives of silybin (2–4) showed no inhibition in cell free systems; eg did not alter the xanthine oxidase activity and the hem-mediated oxidative degradation of LDL. In conclusion, the antioxidant activity of (1) might be due to its ability to inhibit PKC translocation and NADPH oxidase activation in PMA-stimulated neutrophils. The increase of lipid solubility of silybin (1) supports its penetration through cell membrane and enhances its inhibitory effects.

1028062,"Administration of bisphosphonates for cancer bone metastases, especially by the iv route, carries a certain, wellestablished risk of deterioration of renal function [1–9]. Although toxic acute tubular necrosis and collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis have been implicated in the mechanism of renal toxicity [10–12], the pathogenesis is still poorly understood. In patients who have pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) or other risk factors for the deterioration of renal function, for example, multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or advanced age, the administration of bisphosphonates is to be carried out with caution to avoid its deleterious effect on kidney function [13, 14]. Renal function monitoring guidelines have been introduced to reduce the incidence of this serious, potentially life-threatening, adverse event, and serum creatinine level measurement has been proposed as the primary parameter to assess renal risk and to provide guidance to avoid renal toxicity when zoledronic acid is administered [15]. However, excessive changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)—the most important parameter in assessing kidney function—correspond to only small changes in plasma creatinine concentration when patients have near normal to mildly/moderately impaired renal function [16, 17], making plasma creatinine a poor indicator of the corresponding GFR in the earlier stages of CKD. GFR must decline to approximately half the normal level before the serum creatinine concentration rises above the upper limit of normal [18].

1028065,"Despite the prevalence and recognition of its detrimental impact, clinical complications of sepsis remain a major challenge. Here, we investigated the effects of myeloid ferritin heavy chain (FtH) in regulating the pathogenic sequelae of sepsis. We demonstrate that deletion of myeloid FtH leads to protection against lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia and cecal ligation and puncture-induced model of sepsis as evidenced by reduced cytokine levels, multi-organ dysfunction and mortality. We identified that such protection is predominantly mediated by the compensatory increase in circulating ferritin (ferritin light chain; FtL) in the absence of myeloid FtH. Our in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that prior exposure to ferritin light chain restrains an otherwise dysregulated response to infection. These findings are mediated by an inhibitory action of FtL on NF-κB activation, a key signaling pathway that is implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. We further identified that LPS mediated activation of MAPK pathways, specifically, JNK and ERK were also reduced with FtL pre-treatment. Taken together, our findings elucidate a crucial immunomodulatory function for circulating ferritin that challenges the traditional view of this protein as a mere marker of body iron stores.

Expression of CSE was upregulated predominantly in macrophages, foam cells, and myofibroblasts of human atherosclerotic lesions derived from carotid artery specimens of patients. A similar pattern was observed in aortic lesions of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice on high-fat diet. We identified several triggers for inducing CSE expression in macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells including heme, ferrylHb, plaque lipids, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β. In the interplay between hemoglobin and atheroma lipids, H2S significantly mitigated oxidation of Hb preventing the formation of ferrylHb derivatives, therefore providing a novel function as a heme-redox-intermediate-scavenging antioxidant. By inhibiting Hb-lipid interactions, sulfide lowered oxidized Hb-mediated induction of adhesion molecules in endothelium and disruption of endothelial integrity.

1028073,"The prevalence of vascular disorders continues to rise worldwide. Parallel with that, new pathophysiological pathways have been discovered, providing possible remedies for prevention and therapy in vascular diseases. Growing evidence suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in a number of vasculopathies, including atherosclerosis, vascular brain events, and diabetes. Heme, which is released from hemoglobin or other heme proteins, triggers various pathophysiological consequence, including heme stress as well as ER stress. The potentially toxic free heme is converted by heme oxygenases (HOs) into carbon monoxide (CO), iron, and biliverdin (BV), the latter of which is reduced to bilirubin (BR). Redox-active iron is oxidized and stored by ferritin, an iron sequestering protein which exhibits ferroxidase activity. In recent years, CO, BV, and BR have been shown to control cellular processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, and antioxidant defense. This review covers our current knowledge about how heme induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (HIERS) participates in the pathogenesis of vascular disorders and highlights recent discoveries in the molecular mechanisms of HO-mediated cytoprotection in heme stress and ER stress, as well as crosstalk between ER stress and HO-1.

RESULTS: It was found that in these patients who are under continuous folic acid supplementation the mean level of homocysteine was 16.8+/-7.2 mumol/L, a value considerably lower than the homocysteine concentration reported for non-supplemented patients. The elevation of homocysteine concentrations was independent of gender, time spent in renal replacement therapy, and the type of renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis: 17.6+/-12.6; hemodiafiltration: 16.6+/-12.9 mumol/L). Data showed an inverse relation between plasma homocysteine concentrations and the concentrations of folic acid and vitamin B12. Moderately severe hyperhomocystinemia (Hcy> 20 mumol/L) was found in about 30% of patients. In those the frequency of patients for homozygous T677 allele of MTHFR was about 25-30%. However, in all ESRD patients the frequency of the homozygotes was the same then in the normal population. Homocysteine plasma levels correlated with MTHFR polymorphism: in the wild type group Hcy was 14+/-7 mumol/L, in the heterozygous …",István Kárpáti and József Balla and Gabriella Szóke and Zsuzsanna Bereczky and Dénes Páll and Thomas Ben and Kornél Toma and Evelin Katona and Attila Mohácsi and György Paragh and Zsuzsa Varga and György Kakuk and László Muszbek,12,3415745253785890382,Orvosi hetilap,27,1635-1640,,Frequency of hyperhomocysteinemia in hemodialysis patients with folic acid supplementation,https://europepmc.org/article/med/12180000,143,2002,/scholar?cites=3415745253785890382,ePh3FuQAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC

We previously reported that hemin is a potent and relevant lipophilic source of iron that can rapidly intercalate into LDL, catalyzing its oxidation and promoting its cytolysis of endothelium. The effects of oral vitamin E on heme-catalyzed LDL oxidation and resulting endothelial damage were studied in 10 volunteers who received daily 800 IU of vitamin E with or without vitamin C (1000 mg) for 2 weeks. Prior, during, and 2 weeks after supplementation, plasma LDL was isolated and its number of alpha-tocopherol molecules, resistance to heme-catalyzed oxidation, and ability to damage porcine aortic endothelial cells were assayed. Vitamin E supplementation doubled the lag phase of LDL peroxidation as compared to control (104+/-18 vs. 58+/-11 min; p< 0.001) accompanied by an increase in alpha-tocopherol content of LDL particles (26+/-6 vs. 11+/-2 mol/mol; p< 0.001). Most intriguingly, LDL-mediated endothelial cell cytotoxicity was prevented (3+/-2% vs. 42+/-12%; p< 0.001). After a 2-week washout period, LDL alpha-tocopherol content, the lag time of LDL oxidation, and oxidized LDL-mediated cytolysis all returned to baseline levels. To determine whether supplements of vitamin E and vitamin C beneficially synergize in these effects, we monitored several volunteers on daily vitamin E alone or vitamin C alone.

1028082,"Accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins resulted from oxidative protein modification induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by activating the pathways of unfolded protein response. In pathologic hemolytic conditions, extracellular free hemoglobin is submitted to rapid oxidation causing heme release. Resident cells of atherosclerotic lesions, after intraplaque hemorrhage, are exposed to heme leading to oxidative injury. Therefore, we raised the question whether heme can also provoke ER stress. Smooth muscle cells are one of the key players of atherogenesis; thus, human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoOSMCs) were selected as a model cell to reveal the possible link between heme and ER stress. Using immunoblotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry, we quantitated the markers of ER stress. These were: phosphorylated eIF2α, Activating transcription factor- 4 (ATF4), DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3 (also known as C/EBP homology protein, termed CHOP), X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1), Activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein, 78kDa) and heme responsive genes heme oxygenase-1 and ferritin. In addition, immunohistochemistry was performed on human carotid artery specimens from patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomies. We demonstrate that heme increases the phosphorylation of eiF2α in HAoOSMCs and the expression of ATF4. Heme also enhances the splicing of XBP1 and the proteolytic cleavage of ATF6.

1028100,"Iron is at the forefront of a number of pivotal biological processes due to its ability to readily accept and donate electrons. However, this property may also catalyze the generation of free radicals with ensuing cellular and tissue toxicity. Accordingly, throughout evolution numerous pathways and proteins have evolved to minimize the potential hazardous effects of iron cations and yet allow for readily available iron cations in a wide variety of fundamental metabolic processes. One of the extensively studied proteins in the context of systemic and cellular iron metabolisms is ferritin. While clinicians utilize serum ferritin to monitor body iron stores and inflammation, it is important to note that the vast majority of ferritin is located intracellularly. Intracellular ferritin is made of two different subunits (heavy and light chain) and plays an imperative role as a safe iron depot. In the past couple of decades our understanding of ferritin biology has remarkably improved. Additionally, a significant body of evidence has emerged describing the significance of the kidney in iron trafficking and homeostasis. Here, we briefly discuss some of the most important findings that relate to the role of iron and ferritin heavy chain in the context of kidney-related diseases and, in particular, vascular calcification, which is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease.

1028123,"Atherosclerosis is strongly associated with cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Besides microvascular dysfunction and diminishment of the cardiac nitric oxide-Protein Kinase G (NO-PKG) pathway, recent evidence suggests that phosphodiesterase 9A (PDE9A) enzyme has an unfavorable role in pathological changes. Here, we characterized a rabbit model that shows cardiac dysfunction as a result of an atherogenic diet, and examined the myocardial PDE9A signaling. Rabbits were divided into Control (normal diet) and HC (atherogenic diet) groups. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography. Vascular function was assessed, along with serum biomarkers. Histological stains were conducted, expression of selected proteins and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels were determined. Signs of diastolic dysfunction were shown in HC animals, along with concentric hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Endothelial function was diminished in HC rabbits, along with marked reduction in the aortic lumen, and increased left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT) pressures. A significant increase was shown in myocardial PDE9A levels in HC animals with unchanged vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation and cGMP levels. Upregulation of PDE9A may be associated with early stage of cardiac dysfunction in atherosclerotic conditions. Since PDE9A is involved in cGMP degradation and in deactivation of the cardioprotective PKG signaling pathway, it may become an encouraging target for future investigations in atherosclerotic diseases.

1028132,"Vascular calcification is a life-threatening clinical condition in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with reduced zinc serum levels. Anemia is another frequent complication of CKD. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilizers, also known as HIF prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors (PHI), are promising candidates to treat CKD-associated anemia by increasing erythropoietin synthesis. Recent evidence suggests that HIFs play a pivotal role in vascular calcification. Our study explored feasible impacts of HIF PHI on phosphate (Pi)-induced calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and tested whether zinc might inhibit this mineralization process. Treatment of VSMCs with PHI aggravated Pi-induced calcium deposition and Pi uptake. PHI promoted Pi-induced loss of smooth muscle cell markers (ACTA-2, MYH11, SM22α) and enhanced osteochondrogenic gene expression (Msx-2, BMP-2, Osteopontin) triggering osteochondrogenic phenotypic switch of VSMCs. These effects of PHI paralleled with increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) expression, decreased Runx2 Ser451 phosphorylation, and reduced cell viability. Zinc inhibited Pi-induced mineralization of VSMCs in a dose-dependent manner and also attenuated the pro-calcification effect of PHI in Pi-induced mineralization. Zinc inhibited osteochondrogenic phenotypic switch of VSMCs reflected by lowering Pi uptake, decreasing the expressions of Msx-2, BMP-2, and Osteopontin as well as the loss of smooth muscle cell-specific markers.

However, when present in excess, iron poses a threat to cells and tissues. The toxicity of iron is largely based on its ability to catalyze the generation of free radicals, which attack and damage cellular membranes, protein, and DNA. Under physiological circumstances this threat is reduced because meticulously regulated mechanisms have evolved to move iron across biological membranes and to ensure that its distribution in multicellular organisms is carefully orchestrated. These mechanisms are responsible to keep free iron concentrations at the lowest sufficient level under healthy conditions.

1028149,"Intraplaque hemorrhage frequently occurs in atherosclerotic plaques resulting in cell-free hemoglobin, which is oxidized to ferryl hemoglobin (FHb) in the highly oxidative environment. Osteoclast-like cells (OLCs) derived from macrophages signify a counterbalance mechanism for calcium deposition in atherosclerosis. Our aim was to investigate whether oxidized hemoglobin alters osteoclast formation, thereby affecting calcium removal from mineralized atherosclerotic lesions. RANKL- (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand-) induced osteoclastogenic differentiation and osteoclast activity of RAW264.7 cells were studied in response to oxidized hemoglobin via assessing bone resorption activity, expression of osteoclast-specific genes, and the activation of signalization pathways. OLCs in diseased human carotid arteries were assessed by immunohistochemistry. FHb, but not ferrohemoglobin, decreased bone resorption activity and inhibited osteoclast-specific gene expression (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, calcitonin receptor, and dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein) induced by RANKL. In addition, FHb inhibited osteoclastogenic signaling pathways downstream of RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β). It prevented the induction of TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6) and c-Fos, phosphorylation of p-38 and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), and nuclear translocation of NFκB (nuclear factor kappa-Β) and NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1).

1028164,"Over the past decades, substantial work has established that hemoglobin oxidation and heme release play a pivotal role in hemolytic/hemorrhagic disorders. Recent reports have shown that oxidized hemoglobins, globin-derived peptides, and heme trigger diverse biological responses, such as toll-like receptor 4 activation with inflammatory response, reprogramming of cellular metabolism, differentiation, stress, and even death. Here, we discuss these cellular responses with particular focus on their mechanisms that are linked to the pathological consequences of hemorrhage and hemolysis. In recent years, endogenous gasotransmitters, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), have gained a lot of interest in connection with various human pathologies. Thus, many CO and H 2 S-releasing molecules have been developed and applied in various human disorders, including hemolytic and hemorrhagic diseases. Here, we discuss our current understanding of oxidized hemoglobin and heme-induced cell and tissue damage with particular focus on inflammation, cellular metabolism and differentiation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in hemolytic/hemorrhagic human diseases, and the potential beneficial role of CO and H 2 S in these pathologies. More detailed mechanistic insights into the complex pathology of hemolytic/hemorrhagic diseases through heme oxygenase-1/CO as well as H 2 S pathways would reveal new therapeutic approaches that can be exploited for clinical benefit.

1028166,"Since its introduction in 1957 the Flame Ionization Detector (FID) is the most widely used Gas Chromatographic (GC) detector. Nowadays there is no Gas Chromatographic laboratory without apparatus containing a Flame Ionization Detector. However, the operation mechanism of the hydrogen flame and signal production is still not completely obvious. The FID response for hydrocarbons is proportional to the carbon content of the compound, while substances that contain heteroatoms yield smaller responses. In the Gas Chromatographic practice, a special relative response factor called Effective Carbon Number (ECN) is used for the expression of the response for molecules containing heteroatom. In the literature there are signal modifying constants published by different authors, which are typical of the carbon atoms and heteroatoms in the different chemical bonds. Although these constants express the nature of the modification (increase or decrease) the exact modifying value always depends on the chromatographic parameters and the molecular structure. If we want to apply the ECN method for our calculations these constants should be determined for our specific Gas Chromatographic system. In our earlier study we investigated the effect of the temperature of the injector, column and detector, the mode of the injection and the concentration level of the substance.

O-(3-piperidino-2-hydroxy-1-propyl) nicotinic acid amidoxime (BGP-15) is a known, well-tolerable drug candidate that exerts beneficial effects in several disease models. As BGP-15 has a significant structural similarity with propranolol, it arose that BGP-15 might also have a direct effect on the heart. Thus, in the present work, we investigated the effect of BGP-15 and propranolol on the contractility of isolated, paced, human right atrial samples (obtained from patients undergone open-heart surgery), with or without previous isoproterenol (ISO) stimulation (evoking an indirect or direct effect, respectively). We found that both BGP-15 and propranolol exerted direct as well as indirect negative inotropic effects on the atrial myocardium, reaching similar maximal response. However, BGP-15 had considerably smaller potency than propranolol regarding both types of negative inotropy. In addition, BGP-15, in contrast to propranolol, had a significantly greater indirect negative inotropic effect on samples exhibiting strong response to ISO. Moreover, the indirect negative inotropic effect of BGP-15 was significantly greater on samples derived from diabetic patients than on samples obtained from non-diabetic ones.

Analysis of individual coagulation and fibrinolytic factors may shed light on the background of this paradox situation. Here we explored components essential for fibrin formation/stabilization in ESRD patients being on maintenance hemodiafiltration (HDF) or hemodialysis (HD). Pre-dialysis fibrinogen, factor XIII (FXIII) antigen concentrations and FXIII activity were elevated, while α 2-plasmin inhibitor (α 2 PI) activity decreased. The inflammatory status, as characterized by C-reactive protein (CRP) was a key determinant of fibrinogen concentration, but not of FXIII and α 2 PI levels. During a 4-h course of HDF or HD, fibrinogen concentration and FXIII levels gradually elevated. When compensated for the change in plasma water, ie, normalized for plasma albumin concentration, only FXIII elevation remained significant. There was no difference between HDF and HD treatments. Individual HDF treatment did not influence α 2 PI activity, however after normalization it decreased significantly. HD treatment had a different effect, α 2 PI activities became elevated but the elevation disappeared after normalization. Elevated fibrinogen and FXIII levels in ESRD patients might contribute to the increased thrombosis risk, while decreased α 2 PI activity might be associated with elevated fibrinolytic potential.

1028175,"Heme released from red blood cells targets a number of cell components including the cytoskeleton. The purpose of the present study was to determine the impact of free heme (20–300 µM) on human skeletal muscle fibres made available during orthopedic surgery. Isometric force production and oxidative protein modifications were monitored in permeabilized skeletal muscle fibre segments. A single heme exposure (20 µM) to muscle fibres decreased Ca 2+-activated maximal (active) force (F o) by about 50% and evoked an approximately 3-fold increase in Ca 2+-independent (passive) force (F passive). Oxidation of sulfhydryl (SH) groups was detected in structural proteins (eg, nebulin, α-actinin, meromyosin 2) and in contractile proteins (eg, myosin heavy chain and myosin-binding protein C) as well as in titin in the presence of 300 µM heme. This SH oxidation was not reversed by dithiothreitol (50 mM). Sulfenic acid (SOH) formation was also detected in the structural proteins (nebulin, α-actinin, meromyosin). Heme effects on SH oxidation and SOH formation were prevented by hemopexin (Hpx) and α1-microglobulin (A1M). These data suggest that free heme has a significant impact on human skeletal muscle fibres, whereby oxidative alterations in structural and contractile proteins limit contractile function. This may explain and or contribute to the weakness and increase of skeletal muscle stiffness in chronic heart failure, rhabdomyolysis, and other hemolytic diseases. Therefore, therapeutic use of Hpx and A1M supplementation might be effective in preventing heme-induced skeletal muscle alterations.

The elevated collagen/elastin content and enhanced expression of adhesion molecule VCAM-1 were decreased. DFC diminished oxidation of Low-density Lipoprotein (LDL) and plaque lipids catalyzed by heme or hemoglobin. Formation of foam cells, uptake of oxLDL by macrophages, upregulation of CD36 and increased expression of TNF-α were reduced by DFC in macrophages. TNF-triggered endothelial cell activation (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs), E-selectin) and increased adhesion of monocytes to endothelium were attenuated. The increased endothelial permeability and intracellular gap formation provoked by TNF-α was also prevented by DFC. DFC acted as a cytoprotectant in endothelial cells and macrophages challenged with a lethal dose of oxLDL and lowered the expression of stress-responsive heme oxygenase-1 as sublethal dose was employed.

Not every patient can be operated, but many of suitable patients refuse this possibility. We aimed to explore the attitudes of patients with chronic kidney disease towards renal replacement therapies to recognize motives, thoughts, and feelings concerning accepting or refusing the treatment. We studied the attitudes towards the illness and the treatment, the appearance of depression, and the disease burden during different stages of the disease.Methods. For this study we implemented a questionnaire that we developed (which has been described in an earlier publication of this journal) with 99 pre-dialysis patients, 99 dialysis patients, and 87 transplantation patients. We completed the attitude questionnaire designed by our team to include disease burden and depression questionnaires.Results. We used discriminant analysis to describe different stages of the disease. There was a significant difference in the following factors between the three patient groups: accepting the new kidney, lack of confidence in transplantation therapy, fear of surgery, accepting self-responsibility in recovery, dependency on the transplanted kidney, confidence in recovery, subjective burden of dialysis, and denial of personal responsibility in maintaining the transplanted kidney. Significant differences were also detected in these three groups regarding the level of depression and disease burden: we measured the highest value among the dialysis patients, and the lowest value among the pre-dialysis patients.

Despite the combined maximum dose oral treatment with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe, we found markedly elevated lipid parameters. Therefore, we indicated monthly selective low density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis treatment using the Direct Adsorption of Lipoproteins system. After more than 2 years the lipid levels of the patients were still above the therapeutic goals. Finally, we completed the treatment by the inhibitor evolocumab biweekly. Further LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction was achieved resulting in lipid parameters on goals. However, administration of evolocumab without LDL apheresis could not reduce the LDL-C below 2.5 mmol/L. We concluded that both LDL apheresis and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor treatments were effective and well tolerated.

Munkánk során in vitro és in vivo körülmények között (humán hem oxigenáz-1 deficienciában) igazoltuk, hogy a hem-protein eredetű hem, amellett hogy önmagában is citotoxikus, az LDL oxidatív modifikációja révén is vezethet endotheliális funkciózavarhoz. Endotheliális sejtkárosodás végstádiumú veseelégtelenségben szenvedőkben is igazolást nyert. Munkánk során bizonyítottuk, hogy a hemodialízis során az antioxidáns tulajdonságú retenciós molekulák eltávolítása elősegítheti az LDL oxidatív modifikációját és a bekövetkező endothelsejt-károsodás veszélyeztetheti az érrendszert.

The sulfhemoglobinemia ratio was 8.6% in the first sample, and 3.77% a month later measured by spectrophotometry. In the hemolysate a new peak was identified as sulfhemoglobinemia by HPLC. It showed the presence of 9.37% sulfhemoglobinemia in the first sample and 4.88% a month later. After omitting the suspected toxic agent the cyanosis decreased significantly.

1028245,"Mouse-to-rat cardiac transplants survive long term after transient complement depletion by cobra venom factor and T cell immunosuppression by cyclosporin A. Expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by the graft vasculature is critical to achieve graft survival. In the present study, we asked whether this protective effect was attributable to the generation of one of the catabolic products of HO-1, carbon monoxide (CO). Our present data suggests that this is the case. Under the same immunosuppressive regimen that allows mouse-to-rat cardiac transplants to survive long term (ie, cobra venom factor plus cyclosporin A), inhibition of HO-1 activity by tin protoporphyrin, caused graft rejection in 3–7 days. Rejection was associated with widespread platelet sequestration, thrombosis of coronary arterioles, myocardial infarction, and apoptosis of endothelial cells as well as cardiac myocytes. Under inhibition of HO-1 activity by tin protoporphyrin, exogenous CO suppressed graft rejection and restored longterm graft survival. This effect of CO was associated with inhibition of platelet aggregation, thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and apoptosis. We also found that expression of HO-1 by endothelial cells in vitro inhibits platelet aggregation and protects endothelial cells from apoptosis. Both these actions of HO-1 are mediated through the generation of CO. These data suggests that HO-1 suppresses the rejection of mouse-to-rat cardiac transplants through a mechanism that involves the generation of CO. Presumably CO suppresses graft rejection by inhibiting platelet aggregation that facilitates vascular thrombosis and myocardial infarction.

1028247,"Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a potential fatal disease characterized by decreased synthesis of heme and accumulation of porphyrin precursors. Infusion of hematin has proven efficacious, but with considerable vascular side effects such as thrombosis and DIG; in contrast, Finnish investigators have demonstrated that heme arginate (HA) is both effective and non-vasculotoxic. We have previously shown that heme (hemin chloride) serves as a catalytically active iron source, potentiating the oxidation of LDL and sensitizing endotnelial cells (EC) to oxidant injury. EC respond to heme and oxidant challenge by upregulating the cell cytoprotectants, heme oxygenase (HO) and ferritin. We now provide a mechanism that accounts for the relative safety and efficacy exhibited by HA treatment but not heme in AIP.
