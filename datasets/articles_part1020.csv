We compare four years (2000 to 2003) of satellite-based calculations of GPP with tower eddy CO 2  flux-based estimates across diverse land cover types and climate regimes. We examine the potential error contributions from meteorology, leaf area index (LAI)/fPAR, and land cover. The error between annual GPP computed from NASA's Data Assimilation Office's (DAO) and tower-based meteorology is 28%, indicating that NASA's DAO global meteorology plays an important role in the accuracy of the GPP algorithm. Approximately 62% of MOD15-based estimates of LAI were within the estimates based on field optical measurements, although remaining values overestimated site values.

To address this issue, fluxes of CO2 (Fc, flux toward the surface is negative) were measured over a Mediterranean, annual grassland in California, USA for 2 years with the eddy covariance method.To interpret the biotic and abiotic factors that modulate Fc over the course of a year we decomposed net ecosystem CO2 exchange into its constituent components, ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production (GPP).

1020002,"Water transport is an integral part of the process of growth by cell expansion and accounts for most of the increase in cell volume characterizing growth. Under water deficiency, growth is readily inhibited and growth of roots is favoured over that of leaves. The mechanisms underlying this differential response are examined in terms of Lockhart's equations and water transport. For roots, when water potential (Ψ) is suddenly reduced, osmotic adjustment occurs rapidly to allow partial turgor recovery and re‐establishment of Ψ gradient for water uptake, and the loosening ability of the cell wall increases as indicated by a rapid decline in yield‐threshold turgor. These adjustments permit roots to resume growth under low Ψ. In contrast, in leaves under reductions in Ψ of similar magnitude, osmotic adjustment occurs slowly and wall loosening ability either does not increase substantially or actually decreases, leading to …",Theodore C Hsiao and Liu‐Kang Xu,593,9437024915968575789,Journal of experimental botany,350,1595-1616,Oxford University Press,Sensitivity of growth of roots versus leaves to water stress: biophysical analysis and relation to water transport,https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/51/350/1595/738124,51,2000,/scholar?cites=9437024915968575789,Mk7BuSwAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC

Questions that remain unanswered and are of interest to biometeorologists include: how do these contrasting landscapes affect the exchanges of energy on seasonal and annual time scales; and, do biophysical constraints imposed by water supply and water demand affect whether the land is occupied by open grasslands or savanna? To address these questions, and others, we examine how a number of abiotic, biotic and edaphic factors modulate water and energy flux densities over an oak–grass savanna and an annual grassland that coexist in the same climate but on soils with different hydraulic properties.The net radiation balance was greater over the oak woodland than the grassland, despite the fact that both canopies received similar sums of incoming short and long wave radiation.

The data were acquired over an annual grassland and from the grass understory of an oak/grass savanna ecosystem in California. We observed that ecosystem respiration was an exponential function of soil temperature during the winter wet season and a jump in ecosystem respiration occurred, at comparable temperatures, during the spring growth period. The depletion of the moisture from the soil reservoir, during spring, limited ecosystem respiration after its volumetric water content dropped below a threshold of 0.15 m3 m−3.

Since these data are often not available at the same spatial scale as the remote sensing imagery, they can introduce substantial errors into the carbon exchange estimates. Here we present further development of a gross primary production (GPP) model based entirely on remote sensing data.

There was up to a 35‐fold variation in day‐to‐day methane emissions due to changes in barometric pressure. Wavelet coherence analysis revealed a strong spectral coherency between variations of barometric pressure and methane emission at periodicities ranging from 1 day to 8 days.

1020026,"Forests currently provide services to communities for conservation and biodiversity of wildlife, watershed and soil protection, for recreation and amenity, for sport and for landscape, in addition to timber production. To these goals should now be added ‘carbon forestry’, the direct role of forest management in protecting forest carbon stocks and enhancing forest sink capacity for carbon. Best estimates indicate that over the past decade terrestrial vegetation, particularly woods and forests, was responsible for the removal of about 40% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) being put into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change (Royal Society, 2001). Now that we appreciate that forests have a vital role in the global carbon budget, forest management should take on responsibility to protect existing carbon stocks and to increase them through enhancement of the forest sink capacity. The recent developing emphasis on continuous cover forestry coupled with selective harvesting goes some way in this direction, but not far enough. Positive measures are particularly required to conserve and enhance soil carbon stocks in forests. A key question is whether we can hope to maintain or even enhance removal of CO2 from the atmosphere in the immediate future by planting trees, and get credit for so doing. In our view, we are really only concerned with the next 50–100 years. Within that period, emissions of CO2 are likely to increase to such an extent that our problems will become insuperable, unless a practical source of alternative energy is developed before then.

1020030,"Over the course of history, temperate and Mediterranean forests have been inter-twined with mankind. First, they coexist with a large fraction of humanity. Second, they are major resources for fuel, timber, and derived wood products. And, third, they are a part of our psyche, as they have been the locale of many legends and much history. When walking through the woods, many key questions come to the mind of a forest ecologist, including what climate and soil factors influence the form of the forest? How does that forest form interact with climate to affect functioning? How will the form and function of forests change in the future as the environment changes? One way to address these questions is through integrated field and modelling studies of carbon exchange (Canadell et al., 2000; Running et al., 199) and ecosystem dynamics (Bugmann, 2001; Foley et al., 1998). The tools of this trade include long-term eddy covariance measurements of CO2 exchange between the forest and the atmosphere, field campaigns on the physiological capacity and water relations of leaves and trees, studies on soil respiration, and periodic inventories of plant biomass and soil carbon (Gower, 2003; Reich and Bolstad, 2001).The objective of this chapter is to synthesize carbon flux field data that can be used to parameterize and validate models that couple biophysics, ecophysiology, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem dynamics; the intent of these models is to understand how the carbon balances of forests ecosystems respond to their environment and disturbances on multiple time-scales.

1020035,"Plant water status is a major factor influencing burning potential of vegetation and a low-cost method to assess the water status can provide an index for fire potential. It can also reduce costs associated with travel to remote locations and can improve fire forecast models. Under severe water stress, plant stomata close and reduce the actual evapotranspiration rate (ETa) relative to the potential evapotranspiration rate (ETp). A fire potential index (I= 1-ETa/ETp) is a measure of vegetation burning potential. When there is no ET reducing water stress, I= 0 and it increases as the ETa rate decreases relative to ETp. The difficulty in the application of a fire index is the cost and complexity to measure or estimate ETa and ETp. From solar radiation (Rs) measurements and site specific calibration, it is possible to estimate net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux density (G). If a good estimate of sensible heat flux density is available, then latent heat flux density (LE) can be calculated as the residual of the energy balance equation (LE= Rn–G-H). The surface renewal (SR) method for estimating sensible heat flux from canopies provides a simple, portable, robust, and low-cost method to measure sensible heat flux density (H). High frequency temperature data are collected with fine-wire thermocouples. The data are analyzed with a structure function to identify average ramp characteristics (ie, amplitude and duration) of the temperature traces during a sampling period. Then the amplitude and duration are used in a conservation of energy equation to estimate H. This method has been used over a wide variety of crops and natural vegetation with good results.

Typically such devices use NDIR technology due to combination of good performance, low cost, field robustness, low maintenance and power demands. Recently, new analyzers were developed to measure fluxes of gases beyond CO2 and H2O using laser spectroscopy. The new way of measuring gas concentrations may also bring a need for a new additional correction to the flux values.Traditionally, when Eddy Covariance flux is computed, the fast changes in gas density are correlated with fast changes in vertical wind speed. Measured changes in gas density happen due to gas flux, thermal expansion and contraction of the sampled gas, water vapor dilution, and pressure-related expansion and contraction.

1020046,"We observed pulse effects of soil respiration following the first rain and second rain after the dry season in California savanna and forest ecosystems in 2002 and 2003. Soil respiration was measured by three different methods: soil CO2 profile measurements using solid-state CO2 sensors buried in several depths of soils, under-story eddy covariance measurements, and chamber measurements. In addition, we conducted laboratory soil incubation experiments and in situ watering experiments to simulate rain events to observe the pulse effects of soil respiration. The results indicated that soil microbes immediately responded to the rain events. The time lag is less than an hour. The pulse CO2 efflux was about 5-10 times larger than the efflux before the rain. Spatially, soil respiration under trees has smaller pulse than that in the open area.

1020066," Fast-response infrared gas analyzers (IRGAs) have been widely used over three decades in many ecosystems for long-term monitoring of water vapor fluxes in the surface layer of the atmosphere. While some of the early IRGA sensors are still used in these national and/or regional eco-flux networks, optically-improved IRGA sensors are newly employed in the same networks. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of water vapor density and flux data from three generations of IRGAs – LI-7500, LI-7500A, and LI-7500RS (LI-COR Bioscience, Inc., Nebraska, USA) – over the course of a growing season in Bushland, Texas, USA in an irrigated maize canopy for 90 days. The energy balance ratio, which is the sum of turbulent fluxes divided by the sum of surface available energy, was used to assess systematic biases of the IRGA sensors for evapotranspiration (ET). Water vapor density measurements were in generally good agreement, but temporal drift occurred in different directions and magnitudes. Means exhibited mostly shift changes that did not impact the flux magnitudes, while variances of water vapor density fluctuations were occasionally in poor agreement, especially following rainfall events. LI-7500 variances were largest compared to recent LI-7500RS and LI-7500A results manifesting in widened cospectra, especially under unstable and neutral static stability. Agreement among the sensors was best under the typical irrigation-cooled boundary layer, with a 14 % interinstrument coefficient of variability under advective conditions.

The same cannot be said for soil CO2 flux (CO2 transport across the soil surface). Based on a 2-year study over a crop (corn/soybean) field at Mead, Nebraska with a 16-chamber automated soil CO2 flux system, we found that the response of soil CO2 flux to rain events depended on the amount of crop residues on the soil surface.

Measuring soil gas fluxes with chambers looks simple but is sensitive to chamber design and measurement techniques. Diffusion from the porous soil is sensitive to gas concentration in the chamber headspace and to small pressure fluctuations due to wind. Increases in chamber CO 2 during a measurement reduce the gradient between chamber and soil atmospheres suppressing the flux and often leading to non-linear plots of CO 2 concentration with time. Extent of this suppression depends upon soil porosity, which partly explains why plots of CO 2 concentration with time are sometimes linear and sometimes not. Elevated chamber CO 2 can also cause elevated CO 2 concentration in the soil atmosphere beneath the chamber, which can affect subsequent flux measurements. These effects will be discussed as they relate to chamber design, data analysis methods, and soil porosity. Evidence will be presented showing similar effects in nature.

1020085,"Soil CO 2 efflux (SCE) is an important component of ecosystem respiration. One of Professor Norman’s important contributions is the “drawn-down” approach for making chamber-based SCE measurements (Norman, et al., 1992. J. Geophys. Res., 97: 18845-18853). He recognized that SCE is driven primarily by diffusion so it is sensitive to CO 2 concentration in the chamber headspace. His idea was to scrub chamber CO 2 concentration to slightly below ambient and then allow CO 2 to accumulate until it reaches a set point slightly above ambient. Flux is plotted against CO 2 concentration and reported when chamber CO 2 equals ambient, minimizing impact of changing diffusion gradient. His approach was implemented in two commercial SCE systems (LI-6200 and LI-6400, LI-COR, Inc.) and has been used widely. The LI-8100 soil CO 2 flux system is designed for multiplexed long-term deployment so chemical scrubbers are not desirable. We built on John’s foundation by integrating the diffusion equation to give an exponential function that is fit to the time series of increasing chamber CO 2 concentration after the chamber closes. The initial slope is used to estimate flux at ambient CO 2 concentration. Comparison between this integral approach and the differential “drawn-down” method yielded excellent agreement, suggesting both methods are effective in minimizing impact of changing diffusion gradient. Continuous field data show that elevated CO 2 concentrations on calm nights can inhibit SCE in nature just as they do in chambers.

We show that under calm and warm night-time conditions, ecosystem respiration can lead to elevated ambient air CO2 concentration (Ca) above the soil, which suppresses Fc, as expected from diffusion theory. We hypothesize that on warm and calm nights prolonged suppression of Fc has the effect of capping the soil, and leads to elevated soil CO2 concentrations (Cs). When the atmosphere becomes unstable at sunrise, or when the friction velocity (U*) increases, this cap is removed by replacing air that has elevated Ca with ambient air characteristic of the well-mixed atmosphere. This can occur quite rapidly producing a large gradient between Cs and Ca, which enhances Fc, especially at sunrise.

It is a closed dynamic system, and has the capability to sequentially measure the soil CO2 flux at up to 16 locations. Each cycle of measurements can be done in one hour. Soil CO2 flux is mostly driven by diffusion and mass flow, with the diffusion being controlled by the CO2 concentration gradient and mass flow pressure fluctuations at the soil surface. In a closed chamber system, the slope of dCO2/dt is required to compute the flux. To minimize the impact of decreased CO2 diffusion gradient on the CO2 flux measurement, the chamber CO2 concentration versus time is fitted with an exponential function. We have also developed a vent design that helps avoid pressure perturbations inside the chamber. Based on Bernoulli's equation, we allow pressure in the chamber to fluctuate along with pressure at the soil surface outside the chamber under both calm and windy conditions.

Extremely high nitrogen concentrations, up to~ 3.5%, were found in oak and grass leaves during the dry year, and the extreme foliage nitrogen maintained longer than other years. It indicated that remaining high nitrogen concentration in photosynthesis tissues (eg, leaf) might be one of important strategies of the plants to maintain necessary rates of carbon assimilation during a profoundly dry year. Because water deficits limited nitrogen uptake during the dry spring, leaf obtained nitrogen primarily from nitrogen stored in the tree. Water deficit limited nitrogen uptake of the tree during the late season, and consequently deficiency of nitrogen storage influenced leaf nitrogen in the year following the dry year.

We deployed one profile system under a tree and another in the open grassland to quantify the absolute and relative contributions of heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration to soil respiration. During the summer this is possible because the grass is dead, so the only source of respiration from the open space is from the decomposition of dead plant material by microbes. In contrast, respiration measured in the soil under the tree represents the respiratory contributions from roots, mycorhizzae and microbes.During the summer dry season, soil respiration rates under the tree were 4 to 6 times greater than those from the open grassland. Diurnal rates of respiration were modulated by changes in soil temperature and by photosynthesis; daily changes in light and vapor pressure deficits suppressed afternoon photosynthesis and this was later reflected in a subsequent decline in soil respiration.

Continuous measurements of carbon fluxes over and under the oak/grass savanna ecosystem started in April 2001. Meteorological and soil parameters (air temperature, radiation, VPD, precipitation, soil moisture etc.) were also measured. Grass leaf area index (LAI), predawn water potential were measured at 1-2 week intervals.

1020096,"Quantifying changes in plant water use efficiency (WUE) under elevated CO 2 and other environmental variable is essential for predicting and modeling productivity in water-limited areas under climatic change scenarios. Hsiao (1993) proposed a simple model to predict changes in WUE as atmospheric CO 2 and other environmental factors vary. Defining WUE as the ratio of CO 2 assimilation to transpiration, the model is based on fundamentals of leaf gas exchange and the ratio of intercellular CO 2 concentration (C i) to ambient CO 2 concentration (C a) characteristic of each species. This ratio (a) tends to be constant as environmental conditions vary, or changes in a simple manner in accordance with a particular environmental variable. The model in the final form can be written as:",Liu-Kang Xu and TC Hsiao,0,,24th Conference on Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,,,,Predicting Water-Use Efficiency Canopy at level under Climatic Change,https://ams.confex.com/ams/AugDavis/techprogram/paper_15687.htm,,2000,,Mk7BuSwAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC

1020098,"The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of C 60 single crystals grown under double temperature gradient (DTG) and single temperature gradient (STG) techniques were investigated at room temperature. The results show that the PL emission intensity increases first and then decreases with increasing illuminated power density for the C 60 single crystals grown by both DTG and STG techniques. Furthermore, one main peak with a shoulder peak can be clearly distinguished at low illumination, while only one main peak without the shoulder peak can be seen at high illumination. The main peak undergoes a continuous blue shift and broadening with the increase of illuminated power density. The difference of PL emission energy at the same illumination density of DTG and STG samples may correlated with the degree of both the orientational disorder of C 60 molecule and lattice perfectness.

1020100,"Long-term continuous and quantitative understanding of methane emission from landfills and how environmental variables control the emission are essential for modeling studies and determining the mitigation strategy to control methane emissions. In this paper we report continuous methane emission studies over two landfills using the eddy covariance method. One, Bluff Road Landfill, is near the city of Lincoln in Nebraska. The other, Turkey Run Landfill, is located in northern Meriwether County, Georgia. The main objectives of our study are:(1) to investigate whether the eddy-covariance method can be used to quantify landfill methane emission;(2) to understand the impact of changes in barometric pressure on landfill methane emissions;(3) to test a simple stoichiometric model we developed recently for estimating landfill methane oxidation fraction using eddy-covariance CO2 and CH4 flux data.",G Burba and D McDermitt and L Xu and J Li and R Green and J Chanton and K Welding,0,,,,,,Using Automated Eddy-covariance Stations for Studying Landfill Methane Emissions,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/George_Burba/publication/309283049_Using_Automated_Eddy-covariance_Stations_for_Studying_Landfill_Methane_Emissions/links/5807817108ae07cbaa541b47/Using-Automated-Eddy-covariance-Stations-for-Studying-Landfill-Methane-Emissions.pdf,,,,Mk7BuSwAAAAJ:UuEBAcK4md4C
1020101,"We quantified the spatial-temporal roles of photosynthesis, temperature and soil moisture on soil respiration of an oak savanna with a combination of field and laboratory measurements. Canopy photosynthesis was quantified from eddy covariance measurements over and under the woodland. Spatial gradients in soil respiration were surveyed with a portable soil respiration chamber. Contributions to soil respiration by autotrophs and heterotrophs were assessed using profiles of CO2 sensors inserted in the soil under a tree and in the open grassland.At a given spot, soil respiration was a function of soil moisture and temperature and labile carbon pools associated with decomposing organic matter and recent photosynthetic production. Spatial/temporal variations in soil respiration reflect changes in these controlling factors. Spatial transect studies, for example, showed that soil respiration decreased by 60% as one radiates from a tree to the open grassland. Soil respiration measured under a tree crown reflected the sum of rhizosphere respiration and heterotrophic respiration while soil respiration measured in an open area represented heterotrophic respiration when the grass was dead during the summer. Basal rates of soil respiration diminished over the summer as the soil dried and it stressed photosynthetic and microbial activity. Summer rains, on the other hand, were found to stimulate the activity of latent microbes immediately, thereby pulsing soil respiration by more than a factor of 10 until the upper soil layer dries. Continuous measurements of soil respiration revealed that soil respiration under the tree was decoupled with soil temperature …",Dennis Baldocchi and Jianwu Tang and Jorge Curiel-Yuste and Liukang Xu and Siyan Ma,0,,,,,,"Soil Respiration and Carbon Sequestration of an Oak-grass Savanna in California: Roles of temperature, soil moisture, rain events and photosynthesis",https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jorge_Curiel_Yuste/publication/267369381_Soil_Respiration_and_Carbon_Sequestration_of_an_Oak-_grass_Savanna_in_California_Roles_of_temperature_soil_moisture_rain_events_and_photosynthesis/links/545a03b40cf26d5090ad4333.pdf,,,,Mk7BuSwAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC
