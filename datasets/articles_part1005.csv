1005046,"Multiple sclerosis is a major cause of neurological disability, which accrues predominantly during progressive forms of the disease. Although development of multifocal inflammatory lesions is the underlying pathological process in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the gradual accumulation of disability that characterises progressive multiple sclerosis seems to result more from diffuse immune mechanisms and neurodegeneration. As a result, the 14 anti-inflammatory drugs that have regulatory approval for treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis have little or no efficacy in progressive multiple sclerosis without inflammatory lesion activity.

1005075,"The neu oncogene encodes a 185 kd glycoprotein (p185neu) with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Sequencing data has demonstrated that oncogenic p185neu differs from c-neu by a single point mutation within the transmembrane region of the glycoprotein. This mutation results in the substitution of a glutamic acid residue for a nonpolar valine residue at amino acid position 664 of the rat neu gene product. Recent studies have demonstrated that this mutation results in specific aggregation of the p185neu oncoprotein mimicking ligand induced dimerization events. The cellular consequences of the aggregated phenotype may include the enzymatic activation of p185neu. We demonstrate that the oncoprotein p185neu possesses higher intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and that this increase in enzymatic activity is apparent within the plasma membrane, manifesting itself through the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates. Furthermore, the neu oncoprotein itself is also phosphorylated on tyrosine to a higher extent than the proto-oncoprotein. These results strongly link enzymatic activation of p185neu to cellular transformation events. To test directly the effect of p185neu tyrosine kinase activity on cellular transformation we constructed mutant p185neu devoid of ATP binding ability. This mutant protein is expressed at high levels, but is unable to induce the transforming phenotype.

1005115,"Background An increasing number of studies report associations between variation in DTNBP1, a top candidate gene in schizophrenia, and both the clinical symptoms of the disorder and its cognitive deficits. DTNBP1 encodes dysbindin-1, reduced levels of which have been found in synaptic fields of schizophrenia cases. This study determined whether such synaptic reductions are isoform-specific.   Methodology/Principal Findings Using Western blotting of tissue fractions, we first determined the synaptic localization of the three major dysbindin-1 isoforms (A, B, and C). All three were concentrated in synaptosomes of multiple brain areas, including auditory association cortices in the posterior half of the superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and the hippocampal formation (HF). Tests on the subsynaptic tissue fractions revealed that each isoform is predominantly, if not exclusively, associated with synaptic vesicles (dysbindin-1B) or with postsynaptic densities (dysbindin-1A and -1C). Using Western blotting on pSTG (n = 15) and HF (n = 15) synaptosomal fractions from schizophrenia cases and their matched controls, we discovered that synaptic dysbindin-1 is reduced in an isoform-specific manner in schizophrenia without changes in levels of synaptophysin or PSD-95. In pSTG, about 92% of the schizophrenia cases displayed synaptic dysbindin-1A reductions averaging 48% (p = 0.0007) without alterations in other dysbindin-1 isoforms.

Three classes of HSV genes have been identified and are classified by both the timing of and the requirements for their expression. These classes are alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, or immediate-early, genes are responsible for the regulated expression of the viral genome. They are transcribed in infected host cells in the absence of viral protein synthesis. The beta, or early, gene class requires functional alpha gene products for efficient expression. Beta gene products include proteins which are directly involved in viral DNA synthesis, as well as enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism.

Vigabatrin (VGB) is marketed in a subset of these countries for the treatment of infantile spasms.

Although the role of cytotoxic T cells in controlling viral infections is well known, a number of immunodeficiencies that predispose to severe viral diseases have recently been ascribed to defects in the Toll-like receptor–interferon signaling pathway.

1005144,"We previously showed that the LAT function required for efficient spontaneous reactivation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) from neuronal latency in the rabbit maps within the first 1.5 kb of the 8.3-kb primary LAT transcript. This demonstrated that LAT does not function via an antisense mechanism, since the first 1.5 kb of LAT does not overlap any other known HSV-1 gene. Furthermore, if LAT encodes a protein essential for efficient spontaneous reactivation, it must map within the functional first 1.5 kb of LAT. Thus, the absence of a well-conserved LAT open reading frame in this region among all HSV-1 LAT genes capable of supporting high levels of spontaneous reactivation would demonstrate that LAT does not encode a protein essential for efficient spontaneous reactivation.

1005152,"Studies on the development of communication and its role in social organization in canids have been conducted primarily on captive animals. Schenkel (1947, 1967) and Zimen (1974) provide the most detailed observations on communication and social organization in the wolf (Canis lupus), and Fox (1971a) reviews many aspects of the ontogeny and phylogeny of communication in several canid species. These studies focus principally on visual displays, and with the exception of Tembrock's research on the vocalizations in Vulpes vulpes and overview of other species (Tembrock, 1968), there is a dearth of literature dealing with vocal, tactile, and olfactory communication in this family. Kleiman (1966) gives some observations of scent-marking behavior in a few captive species, but no systematic studies have been reported on this important aspect of communication. Recent interest in mammalian pheromones and in the possible application of antipredator chemicals to protect livestock from coyotes may rectify this gap in our knowledge. Canids do have well-developed scent glands and vomeronasal, or Jacobson's, organ, and it is surprising that to date no studies have been conducted on this well-defined and accessible organ.In summary, most work has been done on the visual modality of communication (ie, displays) in the Canidae. An exhaustive survey by the authors of field studies of various species (many of which are reviewed by various authors in Fox, 1975a) unearthed little new material to add to our knowledge of the comparative ethology and communication in canids.

1005213,"Originally published in 1987, Being Skilled presents a new model of how children learn to read, and in particular those who learn quickly and precociously. Bringing together ideas from such diverse sources as cognitive and developmental psychology and behaviour analysis perspectives on learning, Stuart McNaughton has produced a more complete theory based on a study of homes and classrooms, and the characteristics of reading behaviour in these settings. Within this theory reading is seen as a symbolic skill with structural properties that partly determine development; but it is also a social practice, in which learning is achieved through problem-solving and the performing of tasks set by particular environments. Drawing on extensive research carried out in Britain, North America and Australasia, McNaughton examines how interactions between teacher and child direct the task of learning to read, and how the relationship between home and school can be a well-matched or a poorly-matched setting in which learning may occur. Being Skilled will appeal to advanced students, researchers and theorists in education and development psychology and to anyone interested in the learning of complex skills.",Stuart McNaughton,34,7883286104919590721,,,,Routledge,Being skilled: The socializations of learning to read,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7883286104919590721&hl=en&oi=scholarr,7,2017,/scholar?cites=7883286104919590721,AbKd9soAAAAJ:Wu2CBzYYpfQC

Using de-identifed data (N = 2,579) generated by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network Core Data Set collected between spring 2004 and fall 2010, the study uses sequential logistic regression analyses to assess prediction of the probability of a given subject having prematurely dropped out of treatment. The findings of this study suggest that African American race, placement in state custody, and a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and major depressive disorder predict treatment attrition.

In this paper a sphero-cylindrical dose model is described to generate a new power law or a look-up table for determination of the total 125I activity required to deliver a prescription dose to a given prostate volume.Methods and Materials: Dose calculations were based on the new standards for 125I seeds (model 6711) implemented by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1999. Using the sphero-cylindrical dose model with peripheral loading approach, a new power law for calculating total activity of radioactive iodine required to deliver a prescribed dose for the target volume was developed. Accounting for random variation of the seed positioning in the prostate and the current air-kerma strength standard of 125I seeds, this new power law is …",Andrew Wu and Chen-Chiao Lee and Mark Johnson and Douglas Brown and Ronald Benoit and Ralph Miler and Jeffery Cohen and Paul Geis and Alex SJ Chen and Shalom Kalnicki,25,8357776834001257233,International Journal of Radiation Oncology* Biology* Physics,5,1397-1403,Elsevier,A new power law for determination of total 125I seed activity for ultrasound-guided prostate implants: clinical evaluations,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301600005526,47,2000,/scholar?cites=8357776834001257233,AbKd9soAAAAJ:ojlX30-wUrgC

1005253,"Viruses utilize normal cell surface structures as attachment sites. Interaction of viral components with these structures may alter target cell growth. In the present study, the expression and function of the cell surface receptor for reovirus type 3 (Reo3R) was studied in neonatal rat optic nerve glial cultures. The Reo3R is expressed by mature oligodendrocytes and astrocytes but not by O-2A progenitor cells. It appears at an early stage of oligodendrocyte development, coincident with the O4 marker but prior to galactocerebroside or myelin basic protein. Anti-Reo3R antibodies stimulate the expression of galactocerebroside by developing oligodendrocytes. Divalent Reo3R-binding peptides are similarly active. Maximal stimulation of galactocerebroside expression occurs with treatment as short as 4 hr, consistent with a receptor-mediated process.

It was subsequently shown to bind to immature oligodendrocytes and their precursor cells but not to the most mature oligodendrocytes. In the present study, we have used immunofluorescence assays on cell suspensions and cultures and on semi-thin, frozen tissue sections to show that protoplasmic and fibrous astrocytes and most ependymal cells are also A4+. Taken together, these results suggest that in adult rats A4 is expressed exclusively by cells of the CNS and that all cell types derived from the neural tube are A4+, at least at some time in their development.

1005258,"First published in 1999, this book examines recent developments in the application of chaos and complexity theory to the applied social sciences and the implications for the government planning of social care services. The study argues that there are fundamental limitations to traditional government political and managerial planning structures. Chaos and complexity theory shows that the effects of time and space are critical aspects for planners to consider. Small changes in isolated social or individual factors can have larger scale effects on the future validity of a policy programme. In particular, rigid linear statistical calculations like the Government Standard Spending Assessment can undermine the ability of local authorities to make realistic plans. It is proposed that government political strategies and managerial methods of analysis need to better understand the complexity of information available to them. New political and institutional typologies are required if planning activity is to evolve to be of optimal social value.",Philip Haynes,23,2836773761814070951,,,,Routledge,Complex policy planning: The government strategic management of the social care market,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2836773761814070951&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,2018,/scholar?cites=2836773761814070951,AbKd9soAAAAJ:RSvx26AYfG8C

In this second of a 2-part article, we present further perspectives regarding the pathogenesis of NMO/SD and how this disease might be amenable to emerging technologies aimed at restoring immune tolerance to disease-implicated self-antigens.

They exhibit greater vagal tone and less sympathetic stimulation than acclimatized lowlanders at high altitudes. Whether young native Tibetans who had spent long-term residence (more than 3 years) at sea level still reserved their unique autonomic characteristics was the main aim of this study. Heart rate variability (HRV) of 10 native young Tibetan male students and 12 Han counterparts were measured at resting supine position at sea level and 1 h after ascent to 3,700 m in a hypobaric chamber (PO2 13.4 kPa). At sea level, Tibetans showed lower heart rate (HR) and greater HRV. At 3,700 m, the increase of HR was greater in the Hans than in the Tibetans, and the HRV was significantly diminished in the Han group but not in the Tibetan group. The results suggested that Tibetans had a greater parasympathetic dominance over the heart at rest, and acute moderate (3,700 m) hypoxia did not influence their HRV significantly, but it did on the Han subjects.

1005274,"T-cell chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV) is a rare disease in which EBV is present predominantly in T cells that infiltrate the tissues; patients have high levels of EBV in the blood. If untreated, patients often develop liver failure, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, coronary artery aneurysms, EBV infiltrating T cells impairing organ function, or T-cell lymphomas refractory to treatment.

1005275,""" Ray has written a book that should be read by anyone interested in the current debates about the general health of civil society in the United States.--American Journal of Sociology The formation, maintenance, and well being of American civil society is a topic of intense debate in the social sciences. Until now, this debate has lacked rigor, with the term"""" civil society"""" commonly used interchangeably and imprecisely with other terms such as civic engagement. Today's discourse also lacks methodological discipline and relies too heavily on narrowly selected evidence in support of a particular argument. In this invaluable contribution to the debate, Marcella Ridlen Ray supplies an empirical study based on a theoretical model of democratic civil society, one that posits high levels of communication, diversity, autonomy, mediation, and voluntary association. In Ray's account, the emergent story of US civil society is that of a dynamic institution, not necessarily one that is linear in its progression. It is a tale of flux, resilience, and stability over the long term that is consistent with subtexts on political equilibrium she notes in the work of early political analysts such as Aristotle, Machiavelli, Locke, Burke, and, later, Tocqueville. Ray dispels the widely accepted myth that Americans are increasingly apathetic and withdrawn from common interests. The evidence reveals a persistence of long-standing public spiritedness, despite the fact that individuals use wider discretion in deciding if and how to attach to community and despite a historical lack of enthusiasm for performing civic duties in lieu of more pleasurable leisure activity. This public-spiritedness continues …",Marcella Ridlen Ray,21,9897096453990518410,,,,Routledge,Changing and Unchanging Face of US Civil Society,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9897096453990518410&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,2017,/scholar?cites=9897096453990518410,AbKd9soAAAAJ:ZnWe2zbntUIC

1005278,"Our goal is to build conversational agents that combine information from speech, gesture, hand-writing, text and presentations to create an understanding of the ongoing conversation (e.g. by identifying the action items agreed upon), and that can make useful contributions to the meeting based on such an understanding (e.g. by confirming the details of the action items). To create a corpus of relevant data, we have implemented the Carnegie Mellon Meeting Recorder to capture detailed multi-modal recordings of meetings.

cord biopsy (a hazardous and, in this case, unwarranted pro- cedure) was performed and that 
histological verification is therefore lacking. The very rapid rate of onset and the clinical similarity 
to some of the verified cases of necrotising schistosomal myelopathy reported by Maciel et all

1005332,"How is it possible to understand society and the problems it faces? What sense can be made of the behaviour of markets and government interventions? How can citizens understand the course that their lives take and the opportunities available to them? There has been much debate surrounding what methodology and methods are appropriate for social science research. In a larger sense, there have been differences in quantitative and qualitative approaches and some attempts to combine them. In addition, there have also been questions of the influence of competing values on all social activities versus the need to find an objective understanding. Thus, this aptly named volume strives to develop new methods through the practice of ‘social synthesis’, describing a methodology that perceives societies and economies as manifestations of highly dynamic, interactive and emergent complex systems. Furthermore, helping us to understand that an analysis of parts alone does not always lead to an informed understanding, Haynes presents to the contemporary researcher an original tool called Dynamic Pattern Synthesis (DPS)–a rigorous method that informs us about how specific complex social and economic systems adapt over time.

Members of the varicellovirus genus, including pseudorabies virus and equine herpesvirus types 1 and 4 (EHV-1 and EHV-4), have genomes that consist predominantly of two equimolar isomers.

In contrast, members of the simplexvirus genus consist of four equimolar isomers, in which both the US and UL can have either of two diﬀerent orientations [1].The complete nucleotide sequence of the VZV genome was determined in 1986 [2]. The VZV genome is a linear double-stranded molecule of about 125 kb in virions. A small fraction of genomes in virions are thought to be circularized [3–5]. The genome is arranged into a UL region and a US region, surrounded by repeat regions. The overall G+ C content is 46%. The UL region consists of about 105 kb (ﬁg. 1) with 44% G+ C nucleotides, while the US region contains 5.2 kb with 43% G+ C nucleotides.

In time-consuming cases, the use of gadodiamide allowed the procedure to continue when the dosage of iodinated contrast approached a toxicity level and would have otherwise prompted termination of the procedure. This likely reduced the total number of procedures necessary. No adverse events due to the intraarterial use of gadodiamide were identified.Conclusions. Gadodiamide appears to be a safe and effective contrast agent for pediatric …",Matthew V Burry and Jeffrey Cohen and Robert A Mericle,11,7358573710574063843,Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics,2,150-155,Journal of Neurosurgery Publishing Group,Use of gadolinium as an intraarterial contrast agent for pediatric neuroendovascular procedures,https://thejns.org/pediatrics/view/journals/j-neurosurg-pediatr/100/2/article-p150.xml,100,2004,/scholar?cites=7358573710574063843,AbKd9soAAAAJ:XAp-VaTZjjwC

1005393,"In 2005, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) Consensus Response Criteria Working Group recommended several measures to document serial evaluations of chronic GVHD organ involvement. Provisional definitions of complete response, partial response, and progression were proposed for each organ and for overall outcome. Based on publications over the last 9 years, the 2014 Working Group has updated its recommendations for measures and interpretation of organ and overall responses. Major changes include elimination of several clinical parameters from the determination of response, updates to or addition of new organ scales to assess response, and the recognition that progression excludes minimal, clinically insignificant worsening that does not usually warrant a change in therapy. The response definitions have been revised to reflect these changes and are expected to enhance reliability and practical utility of these measures in clinical trials. Clarification is provided about response assessment after the addition of topical or organ-targeted treatment. Ancillary measures are strongly encouraged in clinical trials. Areas suggested for additional research include criteria to identify irreversible organ damage and validation of the modified response criteria, including in the pediatric population.

However, this showed no dermal backflow, superficial lymph node visualization, or asymmetric proximal tracer migration and that diagnosis was excluded. While the patient was waiting for the lymphoscintigraphy, she was noticed by a faculty member with an interest in thyroid disorders, including Graves’ disease and its associated orbitopathy and dermopathy.

Increasingly, effective therapies that alter the disease course are becoming available.REVIEW SUMMARY - The purpose of this article is to review emerging drug therapies for multiple sclerosis and to discuss issues that remain controversial. Tizanidine and 4-aminopyridine are two new options for symptomatic management. The role of corticosteroids in the treatment of acute relapses and as chronic therapy is discussed. A comparison is presented of interferon beta-1b (Betaseron), interferon beta-1a (Avonex), and copolymer-1 (Copaxone), the three options with proven efficacy for relapsing-remitting disease.

1005415,"To deepen the understanding of the economics of land regulation and its determinants we test several alternative explanations of the sources of municipal variation on the stringency of the regulatory environment in Argentina. Land use regulation is measured by a new aggregate index of local regulatory restrictiveness—the CIPUV Land Policy Index (CILP)—which comprises diverse sub-indexes that summarize information on the different aspects of the local regulatory environment. We use less-conventional sources of empirical data on regulation, such as a broad database of land cover metrics derived from satellite images for over a hundred municipalities that form part of metropolitan areas of Argentina, and link these metrics with National Population’s Census Data to construct our explanatory variables. Our results, based on OLS and IV estimations suggest weak or no support for the most common hypotheses of the determinants of land use regulation, namely those based on correction of externalities or reflecting the wishes of the majority of (formal) landowners. Our findings might provide support to the exclusionary hypothesis which states that heterogeneous municipalities with higher rates of both educational attainment and share of disadvantaged population tend to practice more restrictive residential zoning. We find that, as population gets denser the stringency of residential land use regulation is less related to welfare economics considerations. Neither is it affected by land-based interests but rather by mild exclusionary aims.

1005421,"Approximately 85% of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients present with a relapsing–remitting (RR) course, in which there are acute relapses followed by partial or complete recovery1. By definition, clinical manifestations are stable between relapses. In most patients, the course eventually evolves into gradual progression with or without superimposed relapses, minor remissions and plateaus, termed secondary progressive MS (SPMS) 1. The transition from RRMS to SPMS is typically rather insidious and occurs over several years. SPMS has been distinguished from primary progressive MS (PPMS) 2 in which patients exhibit gradual worsening from disease onset without relapses (see Chapter 43). In PPMS, the patients tend to have an older age of onset, and relatively more men are affected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrates fewer and less distinct cerebral lesions, a paucity of new lesions over time despite increasing disability and less gadolinium (Gd) enhancement3.At the onset of MS, factors predictive of the development of progressive disease include male sex, older age at onset, motor symptoms, polyregional onset and incomplete remission after first relapse4. After 5 years, a greater neurological deficit, increased number of affected functional systems, incomplete recovery from the last relapse and the occurrence of polyregional symptoms with the last relapse predict the development of progressive disease. However, the predictive ability of these factors, either individually or in combination, is weak. Also, the absence of these poor-prognostic factors is a weak predictor of a good prognosis.

However, chronic inflammation and demyelination lead to axonal degeneration and neuronal loss, for which there currently is no effective treatment.

1005433,"Among the many stressors astronauts are exposed to during spaceflight, cosmic radiation may lead to various serious health effects. Specifically, space radiation may contribute to decreased immunity, which has been documented in astronauts during short-and long-duration missions, as evidenced by several changes in cellular immunity and plasma cytokine levels. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses, either directly from radiation of latently infected cells and/or from perturbation of the immune system, may result in disease in astronauts. Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) is one of the eight human herpes viruses known to infect more than 90% of human adults and persists for the life of the host without normally causing adverse effects. Reactivation of several latent viruses in astronauts is well documented, although the mechanism of reactivation is not well understood. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation,(1) 137 Cs gamma rays,(2) 150-MeV protons,(3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with the increases detected as early as four days post-exposure and generally tapering off at later time points.

1005434,A 20-month-old boy with Williams syndrome had undergone multiple surgical and catheter-based interventions for resistant peripheral pulmonary arterial stenoses with eventual bilateral stent placement and conventional balloon angioplasty. He persistently developed suprasystemic right ventricular (RV) pressure. Angioplasty with a drug-coated balloon (DCB) was performed for in-stent restenosis and to remodel his distal pulmonary vessels bilaterally. This resulted in immediate improvement in the in-stent stenosis and resultant decrease in RV pressure. Follow-up catheterization two months later continued to show long-lasting improvement in the in-stent stenosis. We hypothesize that the anti-proliferative effects of DCBs may be of benefit in the arteriopathy associated with Williams syndrome.

The diagnosis of MS requires certain features, which are well outlined conceptually in the Schumacher criteria (1). These criteria can be restated as:1. A clinical picture (history and examination) consistent with MS, with relapsing or progressive neurologic manifestations indicating multifocal involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) initially developing in a young adult. 2.

1005476,"Identification of anatomical structures in magnetic resonance (MR) images of the human brain is achieved either by manual delineation of by applying coordinate system transformations to map the brain to a pre-labeled atlas. Manual segmentation of 3D MR data is a tedious task made additionally difficult by limitations in visualization. Affine transforms, like the Talairach stereotaxic space, perform a linear scaling of the brain based on manually selected landmarks. This often results in unsatisfactory accuracy for structures further away from the selected landmarks, particularly in pathological cases. It is also based on the trivializing assumption that the brain can be represented as a linearly scalable structure. In the effort to achieve a more accurate and consistent labeling, an algorithm has been designed for the automated alignment of a pre-labeled 3D brain atlas with a sample MRI volume.

In adult mouse, F5 mRNA was expressed at a modest level in lymphoid tissues, at a high level in mature neurons in the nervous system, but not in other tissues. Although the F5 sequence is highly conserved over evolution, the function of the F5 protein is unknown. In the present studies, the putative F5 protein coding region was translated in vitro using a reticulocyte lysate system and in Escherichia coli, yielding a protein with the predicted molecular weight of 42 kDa.

Patients can be switched directly from interferon-β or glatiramer acetate to fingolimod without a washout period.

1005527,"Aims: There are various factors which cause phlebitis in peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN), and one of the greatest risk factors is hyperosmolarity of nutrient solutions. The aims of this study were to determine the osmolarity that peripheral venous endothelial cells can tolerate and to clarify the relationship between the tolerance osmolarity and the duration of infusion. Methods: PPN solutions with different osmolarity (540-950 mOsm/kg), which were prepared to have no acidic effect, were infused to ear lateral veins of rabbits at 5-15ml/kg/h, and the veins (3-10 mm from the tip of catheter) were sampled 20-24 h after infusion and examined histopathologically. The loss of venous endothelial cells, a finding considered to directly reflect the irritability of the solution, was graded as: 0, no changes; 1, loss of endothelial cells in less than 1/3 of vein in cross-section; 2, from 1/3 to 2/3; and 3, more than 2/3.

The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) controls IgG transport from the mother to the fetus and prolongs IgG half-life. Here we show that US11 inhibits the assembly of FcRn with β 2 m and retains FcRn in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consequently blocking FcRn trafficking to the endosome. Furthermore, US11 recruits the ubiquitin enzymes Derlin-1, TMEM129 and UbE2J2 to engage FcRn, consequently initiating the dislocation of FcRn from the ER to the cytosol and facilitating its degradation. Importantly, US11 inhibits IgG-FcRn binding, resulting in a reduction of IgG transcytosis across intestinal or placental epithelial cells and IgG degradation in endothelial cells.

1005567,"Vaccines require a period of at least three months for clinical trials, hence a method that can identify elicitation of immune response a few days after the first dose is a necessity. Evolutionary variable selections are modeling approaches for proper manipulation of available data which were used to set up an animal model for classification of time dependent 1HNMR metabolomic profiles and pattern recognition of fluctuations of metabolites in two groups of male rabbits. One group of rabbits was immunized with human red blood cells and the other used as control. Blood was obtained every 48 h from each rabbit for a period of six weeks and the serum monitored for antibodies and metabolites by 1HNMR spectra. Evaluation of data was carried out using orthogonal signal correction followed by principal component analysis and partial least square. A neural network was also set up to predict immunization profiles. A distinct separation in patterns of significant metabolites was obtained between the two groups, just a few days after the first and the second dose. These metabolites were used as targets of neural networks where each sample was used as test, validation and training and their quantitative influence predicted by regression. This model could be used for prediction of immunization in rabbits a few days after the first dose with 96% accuracy.

1005586,"The goal of this project was to document the autophagy response in human neonatal skin organ culture (SOC) after infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The VZV-infected SOC model has attributes of herpes zoster, in that an injection of virus into the skin is analogous to exit of virus from the sensory nerve termini into skin during herpes zoster. Cultures were maintained for 28 days and periodically examined for an autophagy response by quantitation of autophagosomes with Imaris software. Expression of the STAT3 protein was plentiful in the VZV-infected SOC. Abundant autophagy was observed in VZV-infected SOC between 14-28 days after infection, while autophagy in mock-infected SOC was minimal (p = 0.0003). The autophagic response after infection of SOC with a recombinant VZV genome containing the herpes simplex virus ICP34.5 neurovirulence gene was similar to wild-type VZV (p = 0.3). These results suggested that the VZV-infected SOC system resembled biopsy data from herpes zoster infection of skin.

1005587,"Epididymal protein DE and testicular protein Tpx-1 are two cysteine-rich secretory proteins also known as CRISP1 and CRISP2, respectively. DE/CRISP1 is localized on the equatorial segment of acrosome-reacted sperm and participates in rat gamete fusion through its binding to egg-complementary sites. Recent results using bacterially-expressed recombinant fragments of DE as well as synthetic peptides revealed that the ability of DE to bind to the egg surface and inhibit gamete fusion resides in a region of 12 amino acids corresponding to an evolutionary conserved motif of the CRISP family named Signature 2. Interestingly, protein Tpx-1 exhibits only two substitutions in Signature 2 when compared to DE, and was also capable of binding to the rat egg, opening the possibility for a role of Tpx-1 in gamete fusion. Results showed the ability of recombinant Tpx-1 to significantly inhibit zona-free egg penetration, supporting the participation of this protein in gamete fusion through its interaction with egg-binding sites. Subsequent in vitro competition studies showed that incubation of zona-free eggs with a fixed concentration of recombinant Tpx-1 and increasing amounts of DE, gradually reduced the binding of recTpx-1 to the egg, indicating that both CRISPs would be sharing the egg complementary sites. The possible participation of both epididymal DE/CRISP1 and testicular Tpx-1/CRISP2 in gamete fusion provides important information on the molecular mechanisms involved in this process and supports the idea of a functional cooperation between homologue molecules as a mechanism to ensure the success of fertilization.",DJ Cohen and V Da Ros and D Busso and J Maldera and N Goldweic and PS Cuasnicu,3,12752825416537133792,Animal Reproduction (AR),2,127-129,Colégio Brasileiro de Reprodução Animal,Molecular mechanisms involved in gamete interaction,https://animal-reproduction.org/article/5b5a607ff7783717068b47c5,3,2018,/scholar?cites=12752825416537133792,AbKd9soAAAAJ:oMtqKo3K3HAC

This paper employs a novel quasi-experimental approach that examines the effect of tax savings from net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards on investment over the period 1970-2003. Identification is achieved by controlling for NOL carryforwards available to the firm and the tax it would have paid in the absence of carryforwards. Two different sets of tests built on this approach are employed-one that can be interpreted as a kink test and a matched differences test. Investment is positively related to this tax savings over the entire sample period. The sensitivity of investment to tax savings is strongest in the 1970s.

Many of the anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive medications used to treat these disorders have direct adverse effects on the nervous system, including effects that overlap with neurologic complications of the patient's underlying disorder. Neuromuscular syndromes (peripheral neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, or myopathy) can complicate therapy with corticosteroids, antimalarials, gold, D-penicillamine, colchicine, cyclosporine, and FK506.

1005654,"Defending the nuclear family and extolling’family values’ have long been central features of politics in capitalist societies, in spite of radical left challenges from social, counter-cultural and gay rights movements. This book examines these challenges as they emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, re-appraising their relevance in the light of recent developments, including the spread of more diverse family forms and the rise of the same-sex marriage movement. Drawing on archival research in the US, UK and Australia, the author asks what the emergence of same-sex marriage movements and legislation mean for challenges to the nuclear family in the light of an original general hostility to marriage and family structures in the gay liberation movement, whilst considering the extent to which the nuclear family might be included in the list of social and economic institutions subject to criticism on the part of more recent anti-capitalist movements, such as Occupy. A detailed study of the extent to which the nuclear family remains susceptible to the radical critiques of the last century, Radical Challenges to the Family examines whether the original challenges shed light on ensuring social problems, including domestic violence, child abuse, homophobia, and growing marital dissatisfaction. As such, it will appeal to scholars of sociology and politics with interests in gender and sexuality, the sociology of the family and feminist thought.",Ashley Lavelle,2,15737344060257643397,,,,Routledge,Radical Challenges to the Family: From the Sixties to Same-Sex Marriage,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZwSrCwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:havC8wpHZtoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=Xqnx06ywGL&sig=GyxXSj3dThgPlCDRU0ijvsznk9U,,2016,/scholar?cites=15737344060257643397,AbKd9soAAAAJ:YvgfBAebZEkC

1005674,"Identifying the culprit of unequal school funding in US public schools used to be simple. When public schools derived nearly all of their revenues from local property taxes, the math was straightforward—schools in poor areas were poorly funded while schools in wealthy areas were well funded. Today, with federal and state governments kicking in nearly half of funding for public schools, in part to address previous inequities, understanding why schools with large concentrations of poor students are still being financially shortchanged is much more complex.To date, legislative and judicial attention to inequity in elementary and secondary education finance has mainly focused on variation in resources available to school districts. This focus makes sense because districts have the authority to raise revenue and distribute aid flowing from state and federal sources. Yet focusing on inequities within school districts also merits attention. Budgeting and reporting practices within districts can undermine the intent of even the most equitable state and federal funding streams.

1005677,"Prior to the early 1980s, most multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical trials were observational, without appropriate controls and with little attention paid to the fluctuating natural history of MS. Consensus developed at a 1982 international conference on MS trials recommended that Phase 3 clinical trials for MS should be randomized, blinded, and placebo-controlled. 1 The relative benefits and safety of multiple agents for relapsing forms of MS,“worsening” disease,“clinically isolated syndromes,” and symptomatic management have since been shown using such studies.MS clinical trials follow a pattern that begins with mechanistic (including preclinical) studies, continues into toxicity and safety studies (Phase 1), through preliminary and proofof-concept exploratory studies (Phase 2) and then into registration studies (Phase 3). Biological and imaging markers have become standard primary outcomes in Phase 1 and 2 studies but have been restricted to secondary or exploratory outcomes in Phase 3 studies, as regulatory agencies continue to require evidence based on clinical outcomes for pivotal studies. The widespread use of disease-modifying treatments for MS since 1993 not only has changed short-and potentially longterm outcomes for people with MS, but has also altered the ability to undertake clinical trials using established approaches. 2 Use of approved therapies for individuals with active disease has led to recruitment of subjects with less severe disease into new trials, often resulting in subjects with less disease activity than in the past.

The maximal order of this unit modulo p is p+ 1. An extension of Artin’s conjecture is that there are infinitely many such inert primes for which this order is maximal. This is known at present only under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. Unconditionally, we show that for any choice of 7 units in different real quadratic fields satisfying a certain simple restriction, there is at least one which satisfies the above version of Artin’s conjecture.

The second part reviews the steps other states are taking to deal with the issue of alimony in family law and discusses how Florida might improve its treatment of alimony in the future. 1. IntroductionThe suggestion to use guidelines for the determination of an alimony award is new in Florida. Judge Farmer of the Fourth District Court of Appeal was the first appellate judge to approach the subject in a written opinion in June, 2002. 1 In a concurring opinion, Judge Farmer expressed his view that “broad discretion in the award of alimony is no longer justifiable and should be discarded in favor of guidelines, if not an outright rule.” 2 Judge Farmer recognized that under Canakaris 3 there has been a policy of discretion with respect to alimony, however, he notes that policy is under challenge in the literature.

Most of these problems may be overcome by a reliable measurement of free cortisol.

This paper will answer some of the most frequently asked questions concerning methodological aspects of salivary cortisol measurement (sampling, storage, correlation with blood levels etc.) And describe a number of factors responsible for salivary cortisol stress response variability. Furthermore, findings from most recent studies on HPA functioning using saliva as a diagnostic fluid will be highlighted.

1005701,"• Despite widely different geomorphological configurations between Oregon and Washington estuaries, the average density of 0+ and 1+ crabs is very similar in all systems from Grays Harbor through Coos Bay. Density across subregions reflects riverine influences from the watershed (including episodic low salinity) and, likely, ocean predators near the mouth as causes of reductions in some regions after annual settlement.• Certain subregions support a preponderance of juvenile crabs. For example, about 60-65% of long-term average 1+ juvenile abundance in Grays Harbor is located in the Nother Bay that comprises only about 30% of sub-tidal area.

1005708,"When intra-cerebral space-occupying lesions are small or when they are deeply located in the brain parenchyma, it is sometimes difficult to localize them at surgery or to design the most direct and least hazardous surgical approach. Therefore we have developed a method which combines conventional neurosurgical techniques with craniotomy using stereotaxic guidance. We have used the Brown-Roberts-Wells (BRW) stereotaxic system which allows for CT scan or MRI guidance and does not interfere with the absolute sterility mandatory every time a flap is created. Eleven patients were operated on using this method. The deep tumors were approached through a linear incision of the cerebral cortex; then a needle fixed in the right position on the arc system of the BRW was inserted toward the surface of the lesion; the exposure was finally widened by the inflation of a rubber balloon set on the stereotaxic needle. The post-operative course was very uncomplicated in all these patients. No permanent post-operative neurological worsening was observed, even after the removal of an intra-thalamic tumor.",JF Hirsch and C Rose Sainte and A Pierre-Kahn and D Renier and E Hoppe-Hirsch,2,14426978620242556326,Neuro-Chirurgie,3,164-168,,Stereotaxic technics with an open skull in the treatment of space-occupying brain lesions,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2695853,35,1989,/scholar?cites=14426978620242556326,AbKd9soAAAAJ:tgTmbKTkO1IC

Some are involved in the regulation of growth or function of cells of other tissues.Viral pathogens represent important targets of the immune system.

In this study, the authors made use of JCV serologic status to decide whether a patient received natalizumab or fingolimod, based in part on the fortuitous fact that approximately 50% of patients are JCV seropositive. 5 One could argue it would be inappropriate to randomize JCV seropositive patients to natalizumab. Thus, one advantage of using JCV serologic status to determine treatment was that it allowed the inclusion of all patients.The validity of this approach depends on the assumption that JCV serologic status is independent of MS disease activity, severity, or prognosis. While preliminary data argue against a causative role for JCV in MS, 6 no extant research definitively confirms that JCV infection does not affect disease characteristics or, vice …",Devon S Conway and Jeffrey A Cohen,1,8035684985154301385,,10,1280-1281,Sage Publications,Natalizumab and fingolimod: insight into their relative efficacies in clinical practice,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1352458514535283,20,2014,/scholar?cites=8035684985154301385,AbKd9soAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C

1005786,"BackgroundProgressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) differ from relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) in their clinical course, imaging characteristics, and response to disease-modifying therapy, making it important to have distinct treatment approaches. Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is defined by an initial relapsing–remitting (RR) course followed by gradual worsening with or without superimposed relapses or minor remissions. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) is characterized by gradual disease progression from the outset without distinct relapses. Approximately 50% of RRMS patients transition to SPMS after 10 years, and nearly 90% convert to SPMS after 25 years. Factors that contribute to a more rapid onset to progressive disease from a RR course include male gender, older age of disease onset, early motor symptoms, and a shorter time to second relapse. However, these factors have relatively modest …",Megan H Hyland and Jeffrey A Cohen,1,16947135838829973757,Multiple Sclerosis and CNS Inflammatory Disorders,,57-66,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Progressive MS Treatment Algorithms,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118298633#page=67,,2014,/scholar?cites=16947135838829973757,AbKd9soAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC

Although attention is typically focused on the physical disability associated with MS, the profound impact of mood disorders on the presentation and prognosis has recently begun to be appreciated.–Depression as an early and important clinical manifestation of MS is not a new observation, although it has taken over a century for systematic investigations to be undertaken. Recently, more efforts have been made by providers to treat depression as part of the comprehensive and holistic approach provided to patients with various general medical conditions. The prevalence and impact of comorbid depression in patients with MS cannot be ignored; notably, of all the mental state changes that could potentially occur with MS, depression is the most common by far.

Dr Cohen and Dr Rae-Grant who are renowned researchers and physicians in the field of MS and are investigators on several key drug trials. Extensive use of illustrations and succinct format makes this book an easily accessible and key reference guide. Reviews cutting-edge agents currently in development, while also discussing the clinical features and standard diagnosing criteria and practices of MS from the clinician’s perspective Designed to include thorough descriptions of standard and novel treatment therapies in MS. Explains how to most effectively use the top therapies in MS in the context of a clinical practice and based on investigational trials. Concise but comprehensive Over the past 30 years, there have been significant advances in our understanding of MS due to the use of MRIs to better visualize the disease and due to the introduction of new ameliorating drugs. However, MS is still an incurable disease and diagnosis remains challenging for many physicians; for instance, symptoms often mimic MS, and there is no specific test for the disease. To ensure optimal patient care, there is a need for physicians to remain up to date with new drugs on the market, disease detection, diagnosis, and latest management options. The Handbook of Multiple Sclerosis provides a concise, easily accessible guide for all healthcare professionals involved in the diagnosis and management of this condition, including standard therapies, as …",Alexander Rae-Grant and Jeffrey A Cohen,1,12659873528453899464,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Handbook of Multiple Sclerosis,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=yWcfGIrgdUMC&oi=fnd&pg=PP3&dq=info:yKTdNObnsK8J:scholar.google.com&ots=v5yR4BioHm&sig=IBCRsYteCe7fN-mXg1ki96mL9M8,,2011,/scholar?cites=12659873528453899464,AbKd9soAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC

1005810,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common immune-mediated chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system affecting young adults. MS is characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and neuroaxonal degeneration. In early histopathological studies, it was demonstrated that MS pathology occurs both in the white and in the gray matter. However, since demyelination in gray matter structures is difficult to visualize with conventional histochemistry, or with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, gray matter pathology in MS has until recently been disregarded. As a consequence, MS has been traditionally considered a “white matter disease”. The introduction of newer histopathological staining methods such as myelin protein immunohistochemistry, as well as the implementation of more advanced and quantitative MRI techniques, has shed light on the importance of gray matter pathology in MS in many respects (Fig. 13.1). 1, 2 In particular, the clinical relevance of gray matter lesions has become more obvious. For example, while global white matter damage have been attributed to more general clinical outcome measures, gray matter changes could also be related to more specific clinical manifestations including cognitive impairment within several different domains and to epilepsy. Gray matter pathology can be observed in early stages of MS, but generally grows more prominent with increasing disease duration.",Mike P Wattjes and JG Geurts and Frederik Barkhof,1,4346082445238188500,Multiple Sclerosis Therapeutics,,165,Cambridge University Press,Imaging of gray matter lesions in multiple sclerosis,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=LxQkUu2tfXcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA165&dq=info:1Ln7GPViUDwJ:scholar.google.com&ots=M7hFuBo6JY&sig=iQ8HrG3ZjFkFSLxwEqCwOIpd9nw,,2011,/scholar?cites=4346082445238188500,AbKd9soAAAAJ:U5uP8zs9lfgC

1005811,"The inflammatory process that leads to demyelination and axonal injury in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) has been shown to be closely linked to the infiltration of leukocytes into the central nervous system (CNS). 1–3 The accumulation of lymphocytes and monocytes in the CNS is a highly regulated process involving factors that promote migration across the blood–brain barrier and that support leukocyte proliferation and survival within the CNS. 3 The expression of activated adhesion molecules on the surface of lymphocytes and monocytes is required for migration across the blood–brain barrier. One such adhesion molecule is 41 integrin, a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of activated lymphocytes, monocytes, mast cells, macrophages, basophils and eosinophils (but not neutrophils). 4 A major ligand for 41 integrin is vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), which is expressed on the surface of vascular endothelial cells (including those of the brain and spinal cord blood vessels). 4, 5 Expression of both 41 integrin and VCAM-1 has been shown to be increased in chronic MS plaques. 5 Under the control of proinflammatory cytokines, activation of 41 integrin and its interaction with VCAM-1 mediate the adhesion and passage of activated lymphocytes and monocytes into inflamed areas of the CNS. 4, 6–8 The interaction of 41 integrin with additional ligands, such as fibronectin4 and osteopontin, 9 may modulate survival, priming or activation of leukocytes that have gained access to CNS parenchyma, further contributing to the inflammation cascade.

1005812,"Until recently, a key limitation of all the approved medications to treat relapsing–remitting (RR) MS–four forms of interferon beta (IFN), glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, and natalizumab–was their parenteral administration route. Fingolimod (FTY720, GilenyaR, Novartis AG), a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2010 as the first oral disease therapy for MS. Fingolimod’s efficacy in RRMS is supported by a 6-month, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study, 1 a 2-year, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, 2 a 1-year, active comparator Phase 3 study, 3 and a 4 year Phase 2 extension (see Table 30.1). 4 The prevailing theory is that fingolimod’s efficacy in MS results from inhibiting egress of autoreactive lymphocytes from lymph nodes (LN) and preventing their recirculation to the central nervous system (CNS). Other immune effects and direct CNS actions may also contribute. Interaction of fingolimod with S1PRs in a variety of other tissues accounts for many of its adverse effects (AEs).",Jeffrey A Cohen,1,1474623134925544014,Multiple Sclerosis Therapeutics,,370,Cambridge University Press,Fingolimod to treat multiple sclerosis,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=LxQkUu2tfXcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA370&dq=info:TlrPpu3pdhQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=M7hFuBo6J0&sig=znUtjXIFt9vKXcaloD6eCL8ltpo,,2011,/scholar?cites=1474623134925544014,AbKd9soAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC

1005814,"BackgroundCongress intended the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund to bolster state budgets for K-12 and higher education by providing federal funds to fill budget shortfalls caused by lower than anticipated tax revenues. The program also required states to agree to pursue four reform areas that were primarily focused on K-12 education–called “assurances” in the law–through their use of the funds. When the SFSF was enacted, some states were already facing funding shortfalls as a result of the economic downturn, while others were projecting shortfalls in the near future. Lawmakers targeted education for the grant aid because public schools and institutions of higher education employ a significant proportion of the workforce in every state. By ensuring that K-12 and higher education were well supported, Congress could theoretically ensure that a significant number of jobs would be saved during the economic downturn.[1]Congress divided the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) into two parts–Education Stabilization funds, which were to be used to support education purposes only, and Government Services funds, which were to be used to support other government services in addition to education, like public safety or health care. Education Stabilization funds accounted for $39.8 billion of the $48.6 billion SFSF. The US Department of Education distributed the funds according to a formula defined in the law based on each state’s share of the national 5 to 24 year-old population and each state’s total population.[2] This means that Education Stabilization funds were distributed based on population, rather than which states were facing the most …",Jennifer S Cohen,1,14624816172267526645,New America Foundation,,,"New America Foundation. 1899 L Street NW Suite 400, Washington, DC 20036",The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund and Higher Education Spending: Part 2 of 4.,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED540795,,2011,/scholar?cites=14624816172267526645,AbKd9soAAAAJ:X41XOdD1uaEC

1005819,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) encodes three immediate-early proteins, IE4, IE62, and IE63; however, only IE62 has TAATGARAT-like sequences in its promoter which are present in the promoters of each of the herpes simplex virus immediate-early proteins. The TAATGARAT-like elements on the IE62 promoter bind to VZV ORF10 protein, Oct1, and HCF-1. In addition, histone methyltransferases are recruited to the IE62 promoter to modify chromatin to a transcriptionally active form. VZV IE62, the major VZV transactivator binds to VZV IE4 and IE63, and Med25, part of the mediator complex which upregulates gene expression. VZV IE62, IE4, and IE63 are present in the viral tegument where they may help to regulate transcription early in infection. IE63 binds to several cellular proteins including ASF1 and RNA polymerase II. Two hypotheses have been proposed for regulation of VZV gene expression during latency. First, relocalization of HCF-1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of sensory ganglia in response to stimuli associated with reactivation may help to augment transcription of IE62 to reactivate VZV from latency. Second, promoters of latent genes are maintained in a euchromatic state allowing their transcription, while promoters of genes not associated with latency are in a heterochromatic state resulting in repression of transcription.",J Cohen,1,12250123612005375870,"Alphaherpesviruses Norfolk, UK: Weller SK",,1-16,,Varicella Zoster virus transcriptional regulation and the roles of VZV IE proteins,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12250123612005375870&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,2011,/scholar?cites=12250123612005375870,AbKd9soAAAAJ:x2hKVfJWtf0C

This interdisciplinary team studied the attitudes of physicians toward physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. The study reveals no general ethical consensus about the ethics of physician-assisted death among physicians in Washington state.There is considerable public interest in the legalization of physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. 1 By a margin of 54 to 46 percent, voters in Washington defeated Initiative 119, which would have legalized assisted suicide and euthanasia, in 1991. In 1992, voters in California defeated Proposition 161, a similar initiative, by the same margin. A Michigan law that forbids assisted suicide is currently under court challenge. 2 Several organizations strongly support physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, and efforts to legalize these practices are likely to continue. The debate on these issues among professionals and academic physicians has been contentious, 3"" 12 and specific proposals for permitting assisted suicide or euthanasia have provoked controversy. 13"" 15 Despite extensive discussion, relatively little is known about the opinions of physicians on this subject.

Seizures are influenced by changes in hormone levels, which occur during the menstrual cycle and throughout the reproductive life of women with epilepsy. Establishing an early accurate diagnosis and initiating appropriate medical treatment may decrease seizure recurrence, reduce the number of antiepileptic drug (AED) trials, and minimize the impact of seizures on the patient’s quality of life.

This study examined these same brain regions using PET with 18-F-deoxyglucose (FDG) in a completely new cohort of 19 patients with schizophrenia (mean age= 37.7, SD= 14.7) and 25 healthy matched controls (mean age-36.5, SD= 13.2). Subjects were scanned with our new high-resolution (4.2-4.5 nun FWHM) scanner. Patients were off all psychoactive medications a minimum of 2 weeks. All subjects were screened by history, psychiatric interview, physical exam, and laboratory testing. Controls with a history of mental illness in a first-degree relative were excLuded. During the FDG uptake period, all subjects performed a modified version of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). This task was chosen as it is thought to involve:(1) the frontal lobe, important in short-term memory and executive functions; including those involved in developing strategies for learning; and (2) the temporal lobe, important in long-term memory storage.

1005857,"[en] Development of attenuated mutants for use as vaccines is in progress for other viruses, including influenza, rotavirus, varicella-zoster, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis-A virus (HAV). Attenuated viruses may be derived from naturally occurring mutants that infect human or nonhuman hosts. Alternatively, attenuated mutants may be generated by passage of wild-type virus in cell culture. Production of attenuated viruses in cell culture is a laborious and empiric process. Despite previous empiric successes, understanding the molecular basis for attenuation of vaccine viruses could facilitate future development and use of live-virus vaccines.

The first was a filtering mechanism, which refers to the way that political opportunity structures draw activists with distinct biographical backgrounds into a movement while filtering out others. The second mechanism through which changing political opportunity structures changed the profile of activists was a shift mechanism by which activists moved from the social movement sector to the electoral politics sector at the moment when electoral politics was expanding. The case of Taiwan illustrates some crucial ways in which social movements and elections interact. The efforts of social movement groups in legislative lobbying laid the foundation for interest-group politics in contemporary Taiwan.

Although most of us abhor violence, it is adaptive in certain circumstances, such as when social controls breakdown, as in the so-called subcultures of violence. Given that status is highly universally valued, if a male cannot attain it legitimately, he is likely to attain it through shows of bravado, that often include violence.

Patients diagnosed with male or female pattern hair loss, also called androgenic alopecia (AGA), may experience decreased quality of life, loss of self-esteem, and depression. There is a huge variety of therapeutic options for AGA, creating annual global market revenue of US $4 billion [1]. Medical therapies that include several medications, laser light therapy, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) must always be considered first options, due to the lifetime progressive nature of AGA. In addition, there are several investigative therapies under development, including autologous adipose tissue injection, microneedling, and stem cell injections.

1005934,"As neural innervation of the peripheral tissue continues to develop after birth, neurons may modulate tissue inflammation in an age-related manner. Herein, we investigated the role of the developing nervous system in the asthma diathesis that characterizes the early age. We showed that sympathetic nerves in the lung underwent a dopaminergic-to-adrenergic transition during postnatal development. In addition, dopamine was found to promote a T helper 2 (Th2) phenotype by signaling through a specific DRD4 receptor on CD4+ T cells. Mechanistically, the dopamine-DRD4 pathway acted synergistically with interleukin 4 (IL-4) by upregulating IL-2/STAT5 signaling and reducing inhibitory histone trimethylation at Th2 gene loci. Furthermore, in murine models of allergen exposure, we demonstrated that the dopamine-DRD4 pathway significantly augmented Th2 inflammation in the early lung, but much less so in the adult lung. Taken together, an age-related communication between dopaminergic nerves and CD4+ T cells augments Th2 inflammation in the early lung.",Wei Wang and Jonathan A Cohen and Kenneth G Trieu and Juliana Barrios and Nandini Krishnamoorthy and Matthew R Jones and Alan Fine and Yan Bai and Xingbin Ai,0,,IMMUNITY-D-19-00506,,,,Age-Related Dopaminergic Innervation Augments Th2 Inflammation in the Postnatal Lung,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3389887,,2019,,AbKd9soAAAAJ:rKYHOwt5kWwC

However, contrast-enhancing lesions and T2 lesions reflect pathologic processes that are potentially reversible and that indicate variable amounts of tissue injury (see chapters 6 and 8). Furthermore, lesion measurements fluctuate over time and do not account for diffuse pathology in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM).

Cost analyses differ by the type of costs that are included (eg direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, indirect costs, intangible costs), which costs are attributable to the given therapy, the perspective of the payer, and whether the researchers use cost-identification, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, or cost-benefit analyses.

1005979,"Cells capable of both differentiation and perpetual self-renewal are termed stem cells. Some adult tissues have relatively rapid tissue turnover that mandates a dynamic stem cell compartment. Circulating blood cells have a limited half-life and are continually regenerated from pleuripotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). While the exact phenotype of HSCs is unknown, subpopulations expressing the surface membrane antigen CD34 are pleuripotent stem cells capable of reconstituting life-long hematopoiesis following marrow ablative lethal irradiation.[1]Although HSCs are primarily located in the axial bone marrow, low numbers of HSCs are found in the peripheral vascular circulation during steady state.

1005982,"The two parts of this chapter elaborate the theory and original empirical research findings successively to address the contrasting views of compensation and spillover between idolatry and self-efficacy belief, attachment, and intimacy. Whereas the compensation view maintains that there are negative relationships between idolatry and self-efficacy belief, attachment, and intimacy, the spillover view holds that there are positive relationships between them. Idolatry, predicated on a functionalist conceptualization, consists of idolizing in 11 primary forms. For the fulfillment function, idolizing includes idealizing, beautifying, crediting, glamourizing, and modeling the idol figure. The adaptation function includes idolizing in terms of commodifying and faming the idol figure. Concerning the integration function, idolizing includes romanticizing, befriending, and popularizing the idol figure.

1005983,"We investigate the electronic transport in monolayer graphene Hall bars in which the graphene surface is carefully cleaned and then decorated with a dilute coating of Bi2Te3 nanoparticles. The devices include both monolayer-on-silicon oxide and monolayer-on-boron nitride variants. The Bi2Te3 nanoparticles are high quality with few defects, and mono-disperse with a diameter of approximately 15 nm. Initial measurements were made on graphene with a low coverage of 1 nanoparticle per 10 4 nm 2, and indicate transport not dissimilar from standard for graphene. Upon annealing the sample in Ar to promote removal of the nanoparticle polymer coating, a small leftward shift indicating electron doping was observed. Results in devices with higher nanoparticle densities will be presented.",Joshua Cohen and Jamie Elias and Takashi Taniguchi and Kenji Watanabe and Fudong Wang and William Buhro and Arashdeep Thind and Rohan Mishra and Erik Henriksen,0,,APS,,T70. 285,,Electronic transport in graphene decorated with Bi2Te3 nanoparticles,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019APS..MART70285C/abstract,2019,2019,,AbKd9soAAAAJ:lAj_JhtUatoC

1005984,"There is much interest in inducing a spin-orbit coupling into monolayer graphene in order to engineer the Kane-Mele Hamiltonian and thereby enable observation of the quantum spin Hall effect in graphene. Numerous adatoms have been studied toward this end. Here, we present measurements of monolayer graphene Hall bars with dilute coatings of either osmium adatoms or Bi 2 Te 3 nanoparticles (NPs). With osmium adatoms, we find an unusual hole doping to occur, whereas most metals show electron doping. Nanoparticles of Bi 2 Te 3 have recently been reported to yield possibly quantized transport. We use high quality NPs, monodispersed with diameters of 15 nm. Transport is studied after depositing the nanoparticles, and again after an argon anneal to remove the polyvinylidene fluoride coating on the NPs.

Jeffrey Parcher, in The Value of Debate argued that ""Debate is a uniquely beneficial educational tool in part because of the value of argumentation theory itself. A debate was held between the Harvard University debate team and, wait for it, the Eastern New York Correctional Inmate team. In criminology debates can ensure that theoretical perspectives remain sharp, informed, and up-to-date. Healthy disagreement ensures that advocates of specific perspectives refine their logic, continually search for empirical support, and, importantly, update their views when new information is available.

Architecture in these cases elicits surprise and curiosity, which cannot be achieved through a more deliberate and rationalised engagement with its material features—an engagement that is infused with the expectations and preconceptions of how the environment ought to function. Architectural designs that incorporate tensions through their ambiguous and contradictory features can capture the attention of the imagination, and set in motion its unconscious processes.

Tertiary prevention seeks to prevent that the event or behaviour will occur again. Given the elevated risk of filicide among very young children, prenatal education as well as screening protocols prior to post birth represent periods of possible prevention impact. Threats of filicide, suicide and filicide-suicide should be taken seriously and treated with the care that they warrant.

1006015,"Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) comprises approximately 85% to 90% of MS cases at diagnosis (1). It is a chronic disease characterized by periodic relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations) that represent new focal inflammatory disease activity. The rate of relapse varies among patients, as does the degree of recovery. As a result, patients can accumulate neurologic disability over time from incomplete recovery from relapses or transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Therefore, the current approach to RRMS treatment involves management of relapses, prevention of relapses via disease-modifying therapy (DMT), and symptomatic management. Over the past several years, there have been significant advances in DMT development and treatment strategies. Over a dozen approved MS DMTs have diverse mechanisms of action, potency, safety profiles, and usage considerations that must be taken into account with DMT selection and ongoing management. This chapter presents an overview of these medications, highlighting important differences among them that affect the settings in which they should be used.

Simply put, learning analytics is the collection, analysis, and reporting of learner data, for the principle means of enhancing learning. It is argued that learning analytics–when available in a consistent and digestible format–not only provides educators with a clear view of the learners “footprint” but also allows for the means of navigating the broad spectrum of possible learning interventions. This brief paper outlines a clear definition of learning analytics and provides some suggestions on how learning analytics can assist in informing the decision-making relating to learning interventions for learning designers and educators via an evidence-based approach, one in which learner success is at the …",Jay Andrew Cohen,0,,Development and Learning in Organizations: An International Journal,,,Emerald Publishing Limited,Evidence based learning design–the opportunities afforded by learning analytics,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/DLO-10-2017-0084/full/html?journalCode=dlo&,,2018,,AbKd9soAAAAJ:J3KpcKIlIpsC

Four broad themes are identified: human rights law, the role of technology, a critique of regulatory ‘borrowing’, and the need to be clear regarding assumptions. I conclude that media law benefits from a greater focus on the characteristics of each medium and of the way in which a medium is defined and used in the law. The medium is not necessarily always the message, but an account of media law that focuses on the regulation of the message will only ever be an incomplete and unsatisfying one.",Daithí Mac Síthigh and Charles Acland and Chloe Albanesius and Robert Allen and Annette Hill and Robert Allen and Annette Hill and John Nathan Anderson and Peter Applebome and Dominic Arsenault and Mark Wolf and Benedict Atkinson and Chris Atton and Feona Attwood and Meg Barker and Sara Bragg and Danielle Egan and Adrienne Evans and Laura Harvey and Liesbet van Zoonen and Richard Ayre and Robert Babe and Robert Babe and John George Moss and Linda M Morra and Robert Babe and Robert Babe and Robert Babe and Robert Babe and Lalayn Baluch and Sian Barber and Eric Barendt and Martin Barker and Martin Barker and Aaron Barlow and Susan Barnes and Lance Strate and Edward Wachtel and Leo Barraclogh and Brian Barrett and Anne Barron and Pierre C Bélanger and Geoffrey Manchester and Uladzislau Belavusau and John Belton and Catherine Bennett and James Bennett and James Bennett and Niki Strange and Caetlin Benson-Allott and James Bentley and Kate Berens and Geoff Howard and Richard Berry and Denise Bielby and C Lee Harrington and Jonathan Bignell and Chris Bishop and David Black and Jeremy Black and Menahem Blondheim and Rita Watson and Menahem Blondheim and Rita Watson and Ian Bogost and John Bonnett and David Booton and Angus MacCulloch and Andrew J Bottomley and Geoffrey C Bowker and Susan Leigh Star and Bruce Boyden and Pat Brereton and Timothy Briden and Miles Brignall and Ian Brown and Christopher T Marsden and Simon Brown and Edward Lamberti and Michael Bull and Simon Burlinson and Van Burnham and Joey Anuff and Jeremy Butler and Jeremy Butler and William Buxton and William Buxton and John Caldwell and Lynn Spigel and Jan Olsson and Steven Cammiss and Colin Manchester and Sarah Cardwell and James Carey and James Carey and Owen Chadwick and Michael Chandler and James Chapman and Tom Chatfield and Paul Chatterton and Robert Hollands and Chi-Ying Chen and Paul Chevigny and Aymar Jean Christian and Martin Cloonan and Martin Cloonan and Julie Cohen and Sara Compton and Edward Connor and Robert Cookson and Michael Corcoran and Jonathan Corliss and Baptiste Coulmont and Phil Hubbard and Robert Cox and Rachael Craufurd Smith and Glen Creeber and Charlotte Crofts and Christopher Cwynar and Daniel Czitrom and Angela Daly and Aredhel Darnley and Hugh Dauncey and Madeline Davies and Rosamund Davies and Paul Grainge and Andrew Davis and Annette Davison and Max Dawson and James Bennett and Niki Strange and Adam Dawtrey and Katie Day Good and Terri Day and Ryan Hall and Edward de Grazia and Nicholas de Jongh and Derrick de Kerckhove and Matt Deegan and Ronald Deibert and John Delafons and Vincent di Norcia and Vincent di Norcia and Margaret Dickinson and Sarah Street and Gareth Dickson and Jon Dovey and Robert Allen and Annette Hill and Jon Dovey,0,,,2,1-6,Cambridge University Press,Technological determinism and its discontents,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9225650150061035111&hl=en&oi=scholarr,12,2018,,AbKd9soAAAAJ:SPgoriM2DtkC

With an increased emphasis on targeted treatment approaches, safety profiles and response rates may have changed. We analyzed outcomes of recent phase I pediatric oncology trials. Methods: Peer-reviewed phase I pediatric oncology trials published from 2012 through 2017 were identified through a PubMed search. Selection criteria included a pediatric population (median age ≤ 25 years), diagnosis of cancer (including CNS tumors), and a clear dose-escalation schema. Each publication was evaluated for therapy type (cytotoxic versus targeted, combination vs. single agent), trial design, patient characteristics, toxicity, and response.

1006030,"The adaptive immunity in early life is polarized towards Th2 response, which contributes to increased susceptibility to asthma in children. However, the molecular mechanism of age-related Th2 bias remains poorly understood. Building upon critical roles of nerves in the modulation of immune responses, we investigated the crosstalk between the developing nervous system and the immune cells in postnatal lungs using murine models and human lung tissues/cells. Notably, like human, mice exhibit similar early-life Th2 bias, as allergen exposure elicits more robust inflammation in neonates than in adult mice. In addition, our previous studies revealed a similar profile of neurogenic factors between mouse and human lungs. Therefore, the neonatal mouse model of asthma provides an invaluable tool to identify potential modulatory roles of nerves in early life Th2 immunity bias. In this study, we identified dopamine as a …",Wei Wang and Jonathan Cohen and Kenneth Trieu and Yan Bai and Xingbin Ai,0,,,1 Supplement,44.22-44.22,American Association of Immunologists,The crosstalk between developing sympathetic nerves and immune cells contributes to early-life Th2 bias in the lung,https://www.jimmunol.org/content/200/1_Supplement/44.22.abstract,200,2018,,AbKd9soAAAAJ:E10ZYwHxBI8C

1006031,"T cells are critical in controlling EBV. IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) is an integral component of T cell signaling and modulates cytotoxic function. ITK activation leads to ITK mediated phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC)-γ, resulting in an intracellular calcium flux, activation of ERK, and translocation of NF-κB and NFAT into the nucleus. ITK is expressed in cells critical for controlling EBV infection, including T cells, NK cells, and invariant NKT (iNKT) cells. Mutations in ITK have been previously reported in 9 patients, ranging from 5 to 18 years of age who presented with low numbers of CD4 T and iNKT cells and EBV driven B cell lymphoproliferation.
