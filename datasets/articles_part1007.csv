1007000,"We describe a new molecular approach to analyzing the genetic diversity of complex microbial populations. This technique is based on the separation of polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments of genes coding for 16S rRNA, all the same length, by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE analysis of different microbial communities demonstrated the presence of up to 10 distinguishable bands in the separation pattern, which were most likely derived from as many different species constituting these populations, and thereby generated a DGGE profile of the populations. We showed that it is possible to identify constituents which represent only 1% of the total population. With an oligonucleotide probe specific for the V3 region of 16S rRNA of sulfate-reducing bacteria, particular DNA fragments from some of the microbial populations could be identified by hybridization analysis.

1007002,"With the increased use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture, many densely populated countries face environmental problems associated with high ammonia emissions. The process of anaerobic ammonia oxidation (‘anammox’) is one of the most innovative technological advances in the removal of ammonia nitrogen from waste water 1, 2. This new process combines ammonia and nitrite directly into dinitrogen gas 3. Until now, bacteria capable of anaerobically oxidizing ammonia had never been found and were known as “lithotrophs missing from nature” 4. Here we report the discovery of this missing lithotroph and its identification as a new, autotrophic member of the order Planctomycetales, one of the major distinct divisions of the Bacteria 5.

1007003,"Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are anaerobic microorganisms that use sulphate as a terminal electron acceptor in, for example, the degradation of organic compounds. They are ubiquitous in anoxic habitats, where they have an important role in both the sulphur and carbon cycles. SRB can cause a serious problem for industries, such as the offshore oil industry, because of the production of sulphide, which is highly reactive, corrosive and toxic. However, these organisms can also be beneficial by removing sulphate and heavy metals from waste streams.

1007007,"From recent research it has become clear that at least two different possibilities for anaerobic ammonium oxidation exist in nature. ‘Aerobic’ ammonium oxidizers like Nitrosomonas eutropha were observed to reduce nitrite or nitrogen dioxide with hydroxylamine or ammonium as electron donor under anoxic conditions. The maximum rate for anaerobic ammonium oxidation was about 2 nmol NH+4 min−1 (mg protein)−1 using nitrogen dioxide as electron acceptor. This reaction, which may involve NO as an intermediate, is thought to generate energy sufficient for survival under anoxic conditions, but not for growth.

1007010,"The application of concrete is rapidly increasing worldwide and therefore the development of sustainable concrete is urgently needed for environmental reasons. As presently about 7% of the total anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 emission is due to cement production, mechanisms that would contribute to a longer service life of concrete structures would make the material not only more durable but also more sustainable. One such mechanism that receives increasing attention in recent years is the ability for self-repair, i.e. the autonomous healing of cracks in concrete. In this study we investigated the potential of bacteria to act as self-healing agent in concrete, i.e. their ability to repair occurring cracks.

The genus Thioalkalivibrio is the most physiologically diverse and covers whole spectrum of salt/pH conditions present in soda lakes. The dominant subgroup of this genus is able to grow in saturated soda brines containing 4 M total Na+ - a unique property for any known aerobic chemolithoautotrophs. Some of the species can use thiocyanate as a sole energy source and 3 species out of 9 can grow anaerobically with nitrogen oxides. The reductive part of the cycle is also active in anoxic sediments of various soda lakes. In situ and laboratory experiments showed high sulfate reduction rates only hampered at salt-saturated conditions. The highest rates of sulfidogenesis were observed with elemental sulfur followed by thiosulfate. Formate was the most efficient electron donor with all three sulfur electron acceptors, while acetate was only utilized as an electron donor at sulfur-reducing conditions. The soda lake sulfidogenesis showed obligately alkaliphilic pH response matching the in situ conditions. Microbiological analysis showed a domination of three groups of haloalkaliphilic autotrophic SRB belonging to the order Desulfovibrionales with a clear tendency to grow by thiosulfate disproportionation even at salt-saturating conditions.

However, little is known about their diversity and distribution in various environments. The aim of this study was to develop a PCR-DGGE assay enabling the detection of neutrophilic iron oxidizers in wetland habitats. Gradient tubes were used to enrich FeOB. From these enrichments, a clone library was established on the basis of the almost complete 16S rRNA gene using the universal bacterial primers 27f and 1492r. This clone library consisted of mainly α-and β-Proteobacteria, among which two major clusters were closely related to Gallionella spp. Specific probes and primers were developed on the basis of this 16S rRNA gene clone library.

They play an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments, providing food and shelter for animals, and recycling nutrients. Like other plants, seagrasses live intimately with both beneficial and unfavourable microorganisms. Although much is known about the microbiomes of terrestrial plants, little is known about the microbiomes of seagrasses. Here we present the results of a detailed study on the rhizosphere microbiome of seagrass species across the North-eastern Atlantic Ocean: Zostera marina, Zostera noltii and Cymodocea nodosa. High-resolution amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that the rhizobiomes were significantly different from the bacterial communities of surrounding bulk sediment and seawater. Although we found no significant differences between the rhizobiomes of different seagrass species within the same region, those of seagrasses in different geographical locations differed strongly. These results strongly suggest that the seagrass rhizobiomes are shaped by plant metabolism, but not coevolved with their host.

1007152,"Despite their crucial role in the nitrogen cycle, freshwater ecosystems are relatively rarely studied for active ammonia oxidizers (AO). This study of Lake Lucerne determined the abundance of both amoA genes and gene transcripts of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) over a period of 16 months, shedding more light on the role of both AO in a deep, alpine lake environment. At the surface, at 42 m water depth, and in the water layer immediately above the sediment, AOA generally outnumbered AOB. However, in the surface water during summer stratification, when both AO were low in abundance, AOB were more numerous than AOA. Temporal distribution patterns of AOA and AOB were comparable. Higher abundances of amoA gene transcripts were observed at the onset and end of summer stratification. In summer, archaeal amoA genes and transcripts correlated negatively with temperature and conductivity. Concentrations of ammonium and oxygen did not vary enough to explain the amoA gene and transcript dynamics. The observed herbivorous zooplankton may have caused a hidden flux of mineralized ammonium and a change in abundance of genes and transcripts. At the surface, AO might have been repressed during summer stratification due to nutrient limitation caused by active phytoplankton.",Elisabeth W Vissers and Flavio S Anselmetti and Paul LE Bodelier and Gerard Muyzer and Christa Schleper and Maria Tourna and Hendrikus J Laanbroek,40,5964813662271774175,Archaea,,,Hindawi,Temporal and spatial coexistence of archaeal and bacterial amoA genes and gene transcripts in Lake Lucerne,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/archaea/2013/289478/abs/,2013,2013,/scholar?cites=5964813662271774175,WQdUeIgAAAAJ:Zh0EY9V9P6UC

Despite the high pH and salt content, highly diverse microbial communities are known to be present in soda lake brines but the microbiome of soda lake sediments received much less attention of microbiologists. Here, we performed metagenomic sequencing on soda lake sediments to give the first extensive overview of the taxonomic diversity found in these complex, extreme environments and to gain novel physiological insights into the most abundant, uncultured prokaryote lineages. We sequenced five metagenomes obtained from four surface sediments of Siberian soda lakes with a pH 10 and a salt content between 70 and 400 g L−1. The recovered 16S rRNA gene sequences were mostly from Bacteria, even in the salt-saturated lakes. Most OTUs were assigned to uncultured families.

Five new species of CPR were among the most dominant community members. Novel dominant lineages were found within previously well-characterized functional groups involved in carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycling. Moreover, key enzymes of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway were encoded within at least four bacterial phyla never previously associated with this ancient anaerobic pathway for carbon fixation and dissimilation, including the Actinobacteria.

1007170,"Feast and famine cycles are common in activated sludge wastewater treatment systems, and they select for bacteria that accumulate storage compounds, such as poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). Previous studies have shown that variations in influent substrate concentrations force bacteria to accumulate high levels of rRNA compared to the levels in bacteria grown in chemostats. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that bacteria accumulate more rRNA when they are subjected to feast and famine cycles. However, PHB-accumulating bacteria can form biomass (grow) throughout a feast and famine cycle and thus have a lower peak biomass formation rate during the cycle. Consequently, PHB-accumulating bacteria may accumulate less rRNA when they are subjected to feast and famine cycles than bacteria that are not capable of PHB accumulation.

However until recently, these methods had the major drawback of being limited to the identification of only one or just a few species at a time. With the use of DNA microarrays, it is possible to identify large numbers of taxa on a single‐glass slide, the so‐called phylochip. There are numerous microarray protocols in the literature.

Here we show that gradual environmental changes induced by, for example, eutrophication or global warming can induce major oxic-anoxic regime shifts. We first investigate a mathematical model describing interactions between microbial communities and biogeochemical oxidation-reduction reactions. In response to gradual changes in oxygen influx, this model abruptly transitions between an oxic state dominated by cyanobacteria and an anoxic state with sulfate-reducing bacteria and phototrophic sulfur bacteria. The model predictions are consistent with observations from a seasonally stratified lake, which shows hysteresis in the transition between oxic and anoxic states with similar changes in microbial community composition.

1007213,"Since its recognition in the late nineteenth century, the ability to gain metabolically useful energy from the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds by bacteria has been regarded as of such significance that it has been used as a primary characteristic in taxonomy. Essentially, any Gram-negative rod that could grow with a reduced sulfur compound as its primary energy source was automatically called ""Thiobacillus."" Similar bacteria with a spiral shape became ""Thiomicrospira,"" and so on. As research progressed over the years, this approach has become steadily less satisfactory, and the development of genetic methods for identification has finally confirmed that the ability to metabolize reduced sulfur compounds is of no more taxonomic significance than the utilization of any other specialized substrate. This chapter describes the scientific stages taken to reach this point, reviews the reorganization that has been necessary among the colorless sulfur bacteria, and considers the fact that while the metabolic trait is of less taxonomic significance than previously believed, this grouping is important ecologically and should be retained.",G Muyzer and JG Kuenen and LA Robertson,22,1930027018281712891,The Prokaryotes: Prokaryotic Physiology and Biochemistry,,555-588,Springer,Colorless sulfur bacteria,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai:dare.uva.nl:publications%2F36d82e5a-3d64-42f2-88cf-7d0a5be1b224,,2013,/scholar?cites=1930027018281712891,WQdUeIgAAAAJ:anf4URPfarAC

Therefore, the assignment of the remaining strains to either existing or novel species is important and will further elucidate their genomic diversity as well as give a better general understanding of this genus. Recently, the genomes of 76 Thioalkalivibrio strains were sequenced.

1007236,"Anaerobic syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) is a thermodynamically unfavorable process involving a syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacterium (SAOB) that forms interspecies electron carriers (IECs). These IECs are consumed by syntrophic partners, typically hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea or sulfate reducing bacteria. In this work, the metabolism and occurrence of SAOB at extremely haloalkaline conditions were investigated, using highly enriched methanogenic (M-SAO) and sulfate-reducing (S-SAO) cultures from south-eastern Siberian hypersaline soda lakes. Activity tests with the M-SAO and S-SAO cultures and thermodynamic calculations indicated that hydrogen and formate are important IECs in both SAO cultures. Metagenomic analysis of the M-SAO cultures showed that the dominant SAOB was ‘Candidatus Syntrophonatronum acetioxidans’, and a near-complete draft genome of this SAOB was reconstructed. ‘Ca. S. acetioxidans’ has all genes necessary for operating the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which is likely employed for acetate oxidation. It also encodes several genes essential to thrive at haloalkaline conditions; including a Na+-dependent ATP synthase and marker genes for ‘salt-out‘ strategies for osmotic homeostasis at high soda conditions. Membrane lipid analysis of the M-SAO culture showed the presence of unusual bacterial diether membrane lipids which are presumably beneficial at extreme haloalkaline conditions.

This study provides a detailed insight into the metabolic sulfur pathways in the rhizobiome of the seagrass Zostera marina, a dominant seagrass species across the temperate northern hemisphere. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed the relative dominance of Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria, and comparative analysis of sulfur genes identified a higher abundance of genes related to sulfur oxidation than sulfate reduction. We retrieved four high-quality draft genomes that are closely related to the gill symbiont of the clam Solemya velum, which suggests the presence of putative free-living forms of symbiotic bacteria.

Effects may be magnified in semi-enclosed systems, such as highly productive coastal lagoon ecosystems. Eutrophication and seaweed blooms can lead to ecosystem disruption. Previous studies have considered only one of these factors, disregarding possible interactive effects and the effect of the blooming species' identity on sediment bacterial communities. We tested the effect of experimental nutrient loading and two common blooming seaweeds (Ulva rigida and Gracilaria vermiculophylla) in coastal lagoon sediments, on the structure of bacterial communities (using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing) and corresponding putative functional potential (using PiCRUSt). At the Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) level, the addition of nutrients reduced bacterial community α-diversity and decreased abundance of sulphate reducers (Desulfobacterales) compared to sulphur oxidizers/denitrifiers (Chromatiales and Campylobacterales), whereas this was not the case at the order level. Seaweed addition did not change bacterial α-diversity and the effect on community structure depended on the taxonomic level considered. Addition of Gracilaria increased the abundance of orders and OTUs involved in sulphate reduction and organic matter decomposition (Desulfobacterales, Bacteroidales and Clostridiales, respectively), an effect which was also detected when only Ulva was added.

1007281,"A molecular ecology workshop for the detection of microbial diversity using microarray technology was held in Camerino, Italy from September 19—21, 2005 to present the achievements of the 5th FP EU MICROPAD. This EU project focused on the development of DNA microarrays for the detection of pathogenic protozoa, diatoms and flagellated algae. The identification of diatoms and flagellated algae with conventional methods, eg electron microscopy, requires broad taxonomic expertise, and monitoring field samples is both labor and time-consuming. Pathogenic protozoa are also difficult to separate from non-pathogenic relatives. Species-specific probes can be used to monitor the biodiversity of these organisms and the lessons learned in this project can be applied in a more general sense to other genes used in a microarray format.In our workshop, we provided an introduction into the application and design of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) probes and DNA microarrays for the assessment of biodiversity. The application of molecular methods to answer ecological questions permits issues of biodiversity to be addressed at all levels. rRNA probes contribute significantly to the assessment of biodiversity at the molecular level because a species-specific probe can be made to recognize any species or higher taxon. It represents a powerful augmentation to traditional taxonomy, which is based on identifying species primarily by morphology; however, it is not the only gene that can be used to provide identification of species.

Some of these lakes possess in addition to their extreme haloalkaline environment also other harsh conditions, to which Thioalkalivibrio needs to adapt. An example is arsenic in soda lakes in eastern California, which is found there in concentrations up to 3000 µM. Arsenic is a widespread element that can be an environmental issue, as it is highly toxic to most organisms. However, resistance mechanisms in the form of detoxification are widespread and some prokaryotes can even use arsenic as an energy source. We first screened the genomes of 76 Thioalkalivibrio strains for the presence of known arsenic oxidoreductases and found 15 putative ArxA (arsenite oxidase) and two putative ArrA (arsenate reductase). Subsequently, we studied the resistance to arsenite in detail in Tv. jannaschii ALM2T and Tv. thiocyanoxidans ARh2T by comparative genomics and by growing them at different arsenite concentrations followed by arsenic species and transcriptomic analysis. Tv. jannaschii ALM2T, which has been isolated from Mono Lake, an arsenic-rich soda lake, could resist up to 5 mM arsenite, whereas Tv. thiocyanoxidans ARh2T, which was isolated from a Kenyan soda lake, could only grow up to 0.1 mM arsenite.

Comparative analysis of populations associated with ALWC layers and NLWC (Normal Low Water Corrosion) layers evidenced clear differences in the structure and composition of the communities. Dominant phylotypes related to sulphate-reducing bacteria pertaining to Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae were identified in both type of deposits (fraction of 52% and 44% of the total NLWC and ALWC communities, respectively). Phylotypes related to sulphur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to Alpha-, Gamma-and Epsilonproteobacteria were unique to ALWC deposits, while phylotypes related to oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms (cyanobacteria, diatoms) were only retrieved in NLWC deposits. This suggested that biologically-mediated sulphur cycle was the dominant process within ALWC deposits vs. chemically-mediated sulphur cycle within NLWC deposits. Since most of the members identified are heterotrophs, it is speculated that organic carbon may be available through water pollution and/or proliferation of photosynthetic biomass. Differences in oxygen concentration between ALWC and NLWC areas due to photosynthetic activities in NLWC may be an important factor contributing to the acceleration of corrosion by the mechanism of differential aeration.",Florence Marty and Mark van Loosdrecht and Gerard Muyzer,1,14704715329531501854,,,,NorfolkCaister Academic Press,Molecular Characterization of Microbial Communities Associated with Accelerated Low-water Corrosion (ALWC) on European Harbour Structures,https://dare.uva.nl/record/1/432972,,2014,/scholar?cites=14704715329531501854,WQdUeIgAAAAJ:BzfGm06jWhQC

1007299,"The revised drinking water standard for arsenic imposes a 10 μg L-1 threshold limit (World Health Organisation), which has boosted research efforts to remove arsenic efficiently. Arsenic has a high affinity for adsorption to metal oxides, with arsenate [As (V)] being more effectively adsorbed than arsenite [As (III)]. Consequently the oxidation of As (III) to As (V) is a prerequisite for achieving arsenic concentrations below the threshold. Bacterial As (III)-oxidation is a promising step in the removal of arsenic from groundwater in combination with adsorbing materials such as goethite, as a sustainable alternative to the use of chemical oxidants. The aim of our work was to study the indigenous microbial communities of arsenic-rich groundwater from Lombardia (Italy) and to isolate As (III) oxidizing bacteria in order to test the feasibility of an arsenic removal process that comprises biological oxidation of As (III) to As (V) followed by adsorption to goethite. Water samples were collected from ten sites (six wells and four piezometers), chosen from the dataset of the Regional Agency for Health Prevention and Environmental Protection of Lombardia, and based on their different levels of arsenic content. Water samples were previously purged under controlled flow until stabilization of temperature, dissolved O2 and redox potential. pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were determined on refrigerated samples, within a few hours after collection.

Mono-phototrophic cultures dominated by the cyanobacterium Geitlerinema sp. were obtained from a laboratory-maintained, low magnesium-calcite stromatolite originating from Lagoa Vermelha, Brazil. This lagoonal system has been described as a Precambrian analogue, illustrating a period of photosynthetically-induced atmospheric oxygenation, which created a global sanctuary from shortwave solar radiation and enabled the evolution of modern life on Earth. The enrichment cultures precipitate carbonates in minimal media, suggesting that cyanobacterial photosynthesis and extracellular polymeric substance production may be crucial in the mineralization of the studied stromatolite. We further show that Geitlerinema sp. can build and maintain filamentous mats under long-term UV-C exposure.

Water samples were taken over the full treatment train consisting of chlorination, spruce media and cartridge filters, de-chlorination, first and second pass reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and final chlorine dosage for drinking water distribution. The water samples were analyzed for water quality parameters (total bacterial cell number, total organic carbon, conductivity, pH, etc.) and microbial community composition by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. The planktonic microbial community was dominated by Proteobacteria (48.6%) followed by Bacteroidetes (15%), Firmicutes (9.3%) and Cyanobacteria (4.9%). During the pretreatment step, the spruce media filter did not impact the bacterial community composition dominated by Proteobacteria. In contrast, the RO and final chlorination treatment steps reduced the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in the produced water where Firmicutes constituted the most dominant bacterial group.

1007312,"Syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) is a process where syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria (SAOB) convert acetate to form CO2 and reducing equivalents. These reducing equivalents are utilized by a syntrophic partner which in most cases is a hydrogenotrophic methanogen or sulfate-reducing bacterium. Until now, SAO has been found to be dominant over aceticlastic methanogenesis under extreme conditions such as high ammonia or high fatty acid concentrations and high temperatures. Here, we investigated the pathway of acetate utilization and the mechanism of SAO in haloalkaline soda lakes that have extremely high soda concentrations and pH. Enrichment cultures of SAOB together with a methanogenic (M-SAO) or sulfate-reducing (S-SAO) syntrophic partner showed that hydrogen is an important interspecies electron carrier. Metagenome analysis of the M-SAO enrichment culture showed that Candidatus Syntrophonatronum acetioxidans is the dominant SAOB, and its genome contained all genes necessary for operating the Wood Ljungdahl pathway in reverse. The genome contained an F1F0 ATP synthase that uses a proton motive force (pmf), but it also contained an energy conserving hydrogenase (Ehb) that pumps out Na+ instead of H+ while consuming intracellular H+ to form H2. This simultaneously generates a pmf while pumping out Na+, which is probably an adaptation to the high Na+ concentrations in soda lakes.

The revised drinking water standard for arsenic imposes a 10 μg L-1 threshold limit, which has boosted research efforts to remove As efficiently. Arsenic has a high affinity for adsorption to metal oxides, with As (V) being more effectively adsorbed than As (III). Consequently the oxidation of As (III) to As (V) is a prerequisite for achieving As concentrations below the threshold. Bio-oxidation of As (III) by microorganisms has recently received attention as a sustainable alternative to the use of chemical oxidants. The aim of our work was to improve the removal of As from groundwater by oxidizing As (III) to As (V) followed by adsorption to goethite. For this purpose, we first isolated an arsenite-oxidizing bacterium, Aliihoeflea sp. strain 2WW, from a biofilm treating contaminated groundwater, and subsequently investigated the As (III) oxidation capability of this strain. The experiments were conducted in Tris-HCl 5 mM (pH 7.2) containing 200 μg L-1 of As, using As (III)-induced and non-induced resting cells. As (III) and As (V) adsorption capability of goethite was evaluated by using 4 g L-1 goethite and increasing As concentrations (25-800 μg L-1). Finally we tested the As-removal efficiency of the combined 2WW-goethite system on a synthetic contaminated water and a contaminated groundwater sample. Resting cells of an As (III)-induced culture of 2WW were able to oxidize completely 200 μg L-1 of As in 8 hours, while non-induced cells oxidized As in 24 hours. Subsequently, results from the As-adsorption experiments showed that goethite removed …",P Zaccheo and A Corsini and L Cavalca and V Andreoni and G Muyzer,0,,,,,,Removal of arsenic from contaminated groundwater by goethite adsorption in the presence of the arsenite-oxidizing bacterium Aliihoeflea sp. strain 2WW,https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/228510,,2013,,WQdUeIgAAAAJ:oi2SiIJ9l4AC

Groundwater of Lombardia (Italy) has been found to contain arsenic concentrations higher than the limit due to the substratum rock types of the site. Within a project, aimed to study the indigenous microbial communities of As-rich groundwater from Lombardia, we isolated an heterotrophic bacterium (strain 2WW) able to oxidise As (III). Here we present the characterization of this strain by evaluating the growth and As (III)-oxidation rate at different pH and temperature, and by investigating the presence of arsenic genes. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain 2WW was most closely related to Aliihoeflea estuarii, affiliated to the Alphaproteobacteria. It completely oxidized 1 mM As (III) within 24 h at 30 C, and within 96 h at 15 C. At 5 C the complete oxidation of As (III) occurred in 350 h. Complete As (III) oxidation occurred also in the pH range 5.0-8.0. The strain carried an arsenite oxidase (aioA) gene highly similar to those of Rhizobiales, and an arsenite efflux pump (ACR3 (2)) gene highly similar to the arsenite transporter of Hoeflea sp strain CH14. For the first time, we provided evidence for the presence of an aioA gene in a bacterium affiliated to genus Aliihoeflea genus and for its As (III)-oxidizing capability. The bacterial As (III)-oxidation is being a promising first step in the removal of arsenic from groundwater, in combination with adsorbents.

1007321,"Introduction Bacterial transformation of arsenic has a high impact on the arsenic cycle in soil and water, threatening public health in both developing and industrial countries. Biological oxidation of the more mobile and toxic arsenite [As (III)] to the less toxic arsenate [As (V)] helps to alleviate this problem, due to subsequent adsorption of As (V) to metal oxides in ground waters. Here we report the draft genome sequence and annotation of Aliihoeflea sp. strain 2WW, the first reported As (III) oxidizing bacterium belonging to the genus Aliihoeflea. Methods Strain 2WW was isolated from a biofilter treating arsenic contaminated groundwater in the Northern part of Italy (Cremona, Lombardia). The genome sequence of Aliihoeflea sp. strain 2WW was obtained by Illumina paired-end and mate-pair sequencing. Results Aliihoeflea sp. strain 2WW oxidized As (III) completely to As (V) in the early exponential growth phase within 24 h at 30 C, 96 h at 15 C and within 350 h at 5 C. The draft genome was assembled into 273 contigs with a genome size of 4,122,965 bp and it was assembled in 10 scaffolds. It had a GC content of 64.37%, 4,139 putative coding sequences (CDS). Genome analysis indicated that Aliihoeflea sp. strain 2WW possessed two different genetic islands: one including 4 genes of the ars operon for arsenic resistance (arsR for regulatory protein, ACR3 (2) for As (III) efflux pump, arsC for As (V) reductase and arsH for protein conferring high resistance to As (V)); the second containing an As (III) oxidase aioBA.

Largest changes were seen in the transition from winter/spring to the productive season. Some phylotypes appeared at similar times during the years, suggesting relatively stable seasonal distribution patterns of these phylotypes. Synechococcus–related cyanobacteria were predominant during summer until into autumn. α-Proteobacteria of the Roseobacter group seemed permanently present from spring through summer into autumn, suggesting coupling to the period of phytoplankton production or light availability.

Because these habitats are often so complex, with different populations of micro-organisms present, it may be necessary to identify individual bacterial species and determine their relative abundance in these natural samples, so as to assess their possible role in biotechnology processes. In addition, the introduction of GEMs into the field requires monitoring of their survival, their interaction with the indigenous microflora and their possible spread to surrounding areas. Accurate methods for identifying and quantifying individual bacterial taxa in natural samples are essential for these studies. Conventional microscopical counting techniques or the use of special culture conditions have been applied but these lack the selectivity and precision necessary to follow individual",DAVID A STAHL and GARY SAYLER and RONALD M ATLAS and GERARD F BARRY and GERARD MUYZER and ROBERT J STEFFAN,0,,The release of genetically-engineered micro-organisms,,207,Academic Pr,DE STEWART-TULL,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8511132839602608225&hl=en&oi=scholarr,1,1988,,WQdUeIgAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C

1007373,"Immunological and Pyrolysis/Evaporation-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (Py/Ev-GC-MS) techniques were applied on coal samples to detect the presence of T. lerrooxidans. a chemolithoautotrophic bacterium which is assumed to play a prominent role in the desulphurization of coal. High numbers of T. ferrooxidans cells were detected in samples that were sterilized prior to the inoculation ol this bacterium. However, in nonsterile coal samples the number of cells was low or cells were completely lacking. These immunofluorescence-DNA fluorescence results were confirmed by the results obtained with Py/Ev-GC-MS.

1007374,"Amino acid racemization is one of several diagnetic reactions that could serve as measures of the geologic age of fossilized macro-molecules in preserved skeletal remains. Immunological studies of fossil and modern mollusks provide an additional measure of diagenetic extent. Antibodies against the EDTA soluble portion of modern M. MERCENARIA have been used to evaluate the extent of diagenetic alteration of immunologically reactive antigens in MERCENARIA fossil samples from Quaternary localities in the coastal plain of Virginia and South Carolina. There is a clear trend of decreasing reactivity with increasing stratigraphic age for both regions, indicating that the specific immunological determinants with the modern MERCENARIA antibodies can react are degrading through time. The decreasing immunological response is linearly related to the increased extend of amino acid racemization. The immunologic reactions are specific for MERCENARIA, as both modern and fossil samples of ANADARA, CRASSOSTREA, AND BUSYCON do not react with the modern MERCENARIA antibodies. Because aminostratigraphic age estimates for physically well-preserved MERCENARIA valves are occasionally in conflict with independently derived age estimates (Wehmiller and Belknap, 1982), immunologic data can provide an independent measure of the extent of diagenesis.

1007376,"In a recent publication (SM Sievert, T. Brinkhoff, G. Muyzer, W. Ziebis, and J. Kuever, Appi. Environ. Microbiol. 65: 3834-3842) we described the spatio-temporal changes in the bacterial community structure of a shallowwater hydrothermal vent in the Aegean Sea near the isle of Milos (Greece). Here we report on the identification and phylogenetic analysis of the predominant bacterial populations and their distribution at the vent site by sequencing DNA molecules (“bands”) excised from denaturing gradient gels. In total, 91 unique bands, most likely corresponding to unique populations, could be identified. From these 22 yielded unambigous sequences. The data indicate the presence of a wide spectrum of bacterial lineages at this vent site, but only a low percentage of sequences matched closely with cultivated organisms. The sequences of two bands were nearly identical (> 98% similarity) to Caldicellulosiruptor lactoaceticus, an extremely thermophilic cellulolytic bacterium isolated from a hot spring in Iceland. Many sequences, eg, the sequence of the most prominent band, showed affiliation to the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium Bacteroides phylogenetic branch, which is known to contain many polymer degrading members. Another set of sequences was affiliated with the Acidobacterium cluster, which contains up to now mainly cloned sequences retrieved from very different environments. This is the first report of their occurrence at a marine hydrothermal site. Other sequences were related to recently published sequences from Obsidian Pool (a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park) that could not be affiliated with known bacterial divisions …",Stefan M Sievert and Jan Kuever and Gerard Muyzer,0,,Stefan M.

The detection of extraterrestrial salts in meteorites and the possibility of former salty pools on Mars stimulated investigations into the response of haloarchaea to Martian conditions. Natronorubrum sp. strain HG-1 is an extremely halophilic archaeon with unusual metabolic pathways, since it grows on acetate and is stimulated by tetrathionate (Sorokin et al. 2005). We investigated the effects of high and low temperature as well as desiccation on Natronorubrum strain HG-1. Growth curves following exposure to extreme conditions showed that the viability of the strain in liquid medium was not affected by a 24 h storage at 4 or− 20◦ C.

1007378,"Desulfotomaculum kuznetsovii is a moderately thermophilic member of the polyphyletic spore-forming genus Desulfotomaculum in the family Peptococcaceae. This species is of interest because it originates from deep subsurface thermal mineral water at a depth of about 3,000 m. D. kuznetsovii is a rather versatile bacterium as it can grow with a large variety of organic substrates, including short-chain and long-chain fatty acids, which are degraded completely to carbon dioxide coupled to the reduction of sulfate. It can grow methylotrophically with methanol and sulfate and autotrophically with H2+ CO2 and sulfate. For growth it does not require any vitamins. Here, we describe the features of D. kuznetsovii together with the genome sequence and annotation. The chromosome has 3,601,386 bp organized in one contig. A total of 3,567 candidate protein-encoding genes and 58 RNA genes were identified. Genes of the acetyl-CoA pathway, possibly involved in heterotrophic growth with acetate and methanol, and in CO2 fixation during autotrophic growth are present. Genomic comparison revealed that D. kuznetsovii shows a high similarity with Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum. Genes involved in propionate metabolism of these two strains show a strong similarity.

1007384,"The present research demonstrates that biological sulfide oxidation is possible in the presence of low concentrations of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) under haloalkaline conditions (ie pH 9.5; Na+ 0.8 M). Experiments with synthetically prepared sulfidic spent caustic (SSC) solutions were performed in continuously fed gas-lift bioreactors. Sulfide was completely oxidized to sulfate (SO4 2-) by haloalkaliphilic sulfur oxidizing bacteria (HA-SOB) belonging to the genus Thioalkalivibrio. Severe inhibition of the biological sulfide oxidation capacity resulting in a subsequent process deterioration occurred at DMDS effluent concentrations between 0.1 and 0.9 mM. The total measured DMDS removal efficiency amounted to 40-70%, of which 25% can be attributed to air stripping. It is yet unclear what other processes contributed to the total DMDS removal and it can only be speculated that the remainder is removed by biological conversion and/or adsorption. Respiration experiments revealed that pure cultures of HA-SOB (Thioalkalivibrio sp. K90-mix, Thioalkalivibrio sulfidophilus) as well as biosludge taken from a full-scale installation for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removal (Thiopaq) were more severely inhibited by methanethiol (MT) than by DMDS.

1007385,"Dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium are among the most abundant and important group of eukaryotic microbes found in coral reef ecosystems. Recent analyses conducted on various host cnidarians indicated that Symbiodinium assemblages in the Caribbean Sea are genetically and ecologically diverse. In order to further characterize this diversity and identify processes important to its origins, samples from six orders of Cnidaria comprising 45 genera were collected from reef habitats around Barbados (eastern Caribbean) and from the Mesoamerican barrier reef off the coast of Belize (western Caribbean). Fingerprinting of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 identified 62 genetically different Symbiodinium. Additional analyses of clade B Symbiodinium using microsatellite flanker sequences unequivocally characterized divergent lineages, or “species,” within what was previously thought to be a single entity (B1 or B184). In contrast to the Indo-Pacific where hostgeneralist symbionts dominate many coral communities, partner specificity in the Caribbean is relatively high and is influenced little by the host’s apparent mode of symbiont acquisition. Habitat depth (ambient light) and geographic isolation appeared to influence the bathymetric zonation and regional distribution for most of the Symbiodinium spp. characterized.

In addition a subsegment of the outer core was taken as a contamination control, checked was if the outer area of the core had a different community composition with respect to the core interior.
