1018000,"FLUXNET is a global network of micrometeorological flux measurement sites that measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. At present over 140 sites are operating on a long-term and continuous basis. Vegetation under study includes temperate conifer and broadleaved (deciduous and evergreen) forests, tropical and boreal forests, crops, grasslands, chaparral, wetlands, and tundra. Sites exist on five continents and their latitudinal distribution ranges from 70°N to 30°S.FLUXNET has several primary functions. First, it provides infrastructure for compiling, archiving, and distributing carbon, water, and energy flux measurement, and meteorological, plant, and soil data to the science community.

1018001,"A comprehensive evaluation of energy balance closure is performed across 22 sites and 50 site-years in FLUXNET, a network of eddy covariance sites measuring long-term carbon and energy fluxes in contrasting ecosystems and climates. Energy balance closure was evaluated by statistical regression of turbulent energy fluxes (sensible and latent heat (LE)) against available energy (net radiation, less the energy stored) and by solving for the energy balance ratio, the ratio of turbulent energy fluxes to available energy. These methods indicate a general lack of closure at most sites, with a mean imbalance in the order of 20%. The imbalance was prevalent in all measured vegetation types and in climates ranging from Mediterranean to temperate and arctic. There were no clear differences between sites using open and closed path infrared gas analyzers.

Comparisons of net ecosystem exchange (FNEE) responses are being made among biome types, phenology patterns, and stress conditions. The comparisons are usually performed on annual sums of FNEE; however, the average data coverage during a year is only 65%.

1018003,"Old-growth forests remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 1, 2 at rates that vary with climate and nitrogen deposition 3. The sequestered carbon dioxide is stored in live woody tissues and slowly decomposing organic matter in litter and soil 4. Old-growth forests therefore serve as a global carbon dioxide sink, but they are not protected by international treaties, because it is generally thought that ageing forests cease to accumulate carbon 5, 6. Here we report a search of literature and databases for forest carbon-flux estimates. We find that in forests between 15 and 800 years of age, net ecosystem productivity (the net carbon balance of the forest including soils) is usually positive.

1018004,"More than half of the solar energy absorbed by land surfaces is currently used to evaporate water 1. Climate change is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle 2 and to alter evapotranspiration, with implications for ecosystem services and feedback to regional and global climate. Evapotranspiration changes may already be under way, but direct observational constraints are lacking at the global scale. Until such evidence is available, changes in the water cycle on land—a key diagnostic criterion of the effects of climate change and variability—remain uncertain. Here we provide a data-driven estimate of global land evapotranspiration from 1982 to 2008, compiled using a global monitoring network 3, meteorological and remote-sensing observations, and a machine-learning algorithm 4.

1018006,"The use of fossil fuels and fertilizers has increased the amount of biologically reactive nitrogen in the atmosphere over the past century. As a consequence, forests in industrialized regions have experienced greater rates of nitrogen deposition in recent decades. This unintended fertilization has stimulated forest growth, but has also affected soil microbial activity, and thus the recycling of soil carbon and nutrients. A meta-analysis suggests that nitrogen deposition impedes organic matter decomposition, and thus stimulates carbon sequestration, in temperate forest soils where nitrogen is not limiting microbial growth. The concomitant reduction in soil carbon emissions is substantial, and equivalent in magnitude to the amount of carbon taken up by trees owing to nitrogen fertilization.

Soil respiration is the largest component of ecosystem respiration. Because autotrophic and heterotrophic activity belowground is controlled by substrate availability, soil respiration is strongly linked to plant metabolism, photosynthesis and litterfall.

Soil organic matter pools, roots and associated rhizosphere organisms all have distinct responses to environmental change drivers, although availability of C substrates will regulate all the responses.

After a drought the disturbances in the reservoirs of moisture, organic matter and nutrients in the soil and carbohydrates in plants lead to longer-term effects in plant carbon cycling, and potentially mortality.

However, the process of model building is arguably subjective, and parameters may be poorly defined.

Quantifying the relationship between flux and climate at multiple time scales is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the role of climate in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Orthonormal wavelet transformation (OWT) can quantify the strength of the interactions between gappy eddy covariance flux and micrometeorological measurements at multiple frequencies while expressing time series variance in few energetic wavelet coefficients, offering a low-dimensional view of the response of terrestrial carbon flux to climatic variability. The variability of NEE, GEP and RE, and their co-variability with dominant climatic drivers, are explored with nearly one thousand site-years of data from the FLUXNET global dataset consisting of 253 eddy covariance research sites. The NEE and GEP wavelet spectra were similar among plant functional types (PFT) at weekly and shorter time scales, but significant divergence appeared among PFT at the biweekly and longer time scales, at which NEE and GEP were relatively less variable than climate. The RE spectra rarely differed among PFT across time scales as expected. On average, RE spectra had greater low frequency (monthly to interannual) variability than NEE, GEP and climate.

1018085," A globally integrated carbon observation and analysis system is needed to improve the fundamental understanding of the global carbon cycle, to improve our ability to project future changes, and to verify the effectiveness of policies aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon sequestration. Building an integrated carbon observation system requires transformational advances from the existing sparse, exploratory framework towards a dense, robust, and sustained system in all components: anthropogenic emissions, the atmosphere, the ocean, and the terrestrial biosphere. The paper is addressed to scientists, policymakers, and funding agencies who need to have a global picture of the current state of the (diverse) carbon observations. We identify the current state of carbon observations, and the needs and notional requirements for a global integrated carbon observation system that can be built in the next decade. A key conclusion is the substantial expansion of the ground-based observation networks required to reach the high spatial resolution for CO2 and CH4 fluxes, and for carbon stocks for addressing policy-relevant objectives, and attributing flux changes to underlying processes in each region. In order to establish flux and stock diagnostics over areas such as the southern oceans, tropical forests, and the Arctic, in situ observations will have to be complemented with remote-sensing measurements.

1018138,"Extreme climatic events, such as droughts and heat stress, induce anomalies in ecosystem–atmosphere CO 2 fluxes, such as gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R eco), and, hence, can change the net ecosystem carbon balance. However, despite our increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms, the magnitudes of the impacts of different types of extremes on GPP and R eco within and between ecosystems remain poorly predicted. Here we aim to identify the major factors controlling the amplitude of extreme-event impacts on GPP, R eco, and the resulting net ecosystem production (NEP). We focus on the impacts of heat and drought and their combination. We identified hydrometeorological extreme events in consistently downscaled water availability and temperature measurements over a 30-year time period. We then used FLUXNET eddy covariance flux measurements to estimate the CO 2 flux anomalies during these extreme events across dominant vegetation types and climate zones. Overall, our results indicate that short-term heat extremes increased respiration more strongly than they downregulated GPP, resulting in a moderate reduction in the ecosystem's carbon sink potential. In the absence of heat stress, droughts tended to have smaller and similarly dampening effects on both GPP and R eco and, hence, often resulted in neutral NEP responses. The combination of drought and heat typically led to a strong decrease in GPP, whereas heat and drought impacts on respiration partially offset each other.

However, uncertainties remain about in situ turnover rates of fire-derived PyOM in soil, the main processes leading to PyOM-C and nitrogen (N) losses from the soil, and the role of N availability on PyOM cycling in soils. We measured PyOM and native soil organic carbon losses from the soil as carbon dioxide and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) using additions of highly 13 C-labelled PyOM (2.03 atom%) and its precursor pinewood during 1 year in a temperate forest soil. The field experiment was carried out under ambient and increased mineral N deposition (+ 60 kg N-NH 4 NO 3 ha− 1 year− 1).

There is a lack of consensus about how these different natural and human-caused factors contribute to the current sink, and the relative importance of factors varies geographically. There have been several continental-to sub continental-scale assessments of future changes in carbon and vegetation distribution in North America, but the resulting projections of future trends for North American forests are highly uncertain. Some of this is due to uncertainty in future climate, but there is also considerable uncertainty in forest response to climate change and in the interaction of climate with other natural and human-caused factors.

We examined 12 sites in mature forests that spanned a 1300 mm yr−1 gradient in mean growing-year climate moisture index (CMIgy ), computed annually (1964 to 2013) as monthly precipitation minus reference evapotranspiration and summed October to September. Maximum leaf area, annual aboveground productivity, and aboveground live tree biomass increased with CMIgy  (r2 = 0.67–0.88, P < 0.05), approximately 50-, 30-, and 10-fold along this drier to wetter gradient. Interannual fluctuations in CMI affected the annual radial growth of 91 % of juniper, 51 % of pine, and 12 % of fir individuals from 1964 to 2013.

Here, we used field plot data collected in a tropical moist forest in the central Amazon to gain a better understanding of the uncertainty associated with plot-level biomass estimates obtained specifically for the calibration of remote sensing measurements. In addition to accounting for sources of error that would be normally expected in conventional biomass estimates (eg, measurement and allometric errors), we examined two sources of uncertainty that are specific to the calibration process and should be taken into account in most remote sensing studies: the error resulting from spatial disagreement between field and remote sensing measurements (ie, co-location error), and the error introduced when accounting for temporal differences in data acquisition. We found that the overall uncertainty in the field biomass was typically 25% for both secondary and primary forests, but ranged from 16 to 53%. Co-location and temporal errors accounted for a large fraction of the total variance (> 65%) and were identified as important targets for reducing uncertainty in studies relating tropical forest biomass to remotely sensed data.

Here we apply a combination of field observations and soil–plant–atmosphere modeling (SPA) to study carbon and water dynamics in a regenerating ponderosa pine forest. The effects of soil and atmospheric drought were quantified based on a field irrigation experiment combined with model simulations. To assess future effects of intensifying drought on ecosystem processes, the SPA model was run using temperature and precipitation scenarios for 2040 and 2080.Experimentally increased summer water availability clearly affected tree hydraulics and enhanced C uptake in both the observations and the model. Simulation results showed that irrigation was sufficient to eliminate soil water limitation and maintaining transpiration rates, but gross primary productivity (GPP) continued to decrease. Observations of stomatal conductance indicated a dominant role of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in limiting C uptake. This was confirmed by running the simulation under reduced atmospheric drought (VPD of 1kPa), which largely maintained GPP rates at pre-drought conditions.

1018199,"A time series from 1977–1989 and 2000–2002 of scientific trawl surveys in the Porcupine Seabight and adjacent abyssal plain of the NE Atlantic was analysed to assess changes in demersal fish biomass and length frequency. These two periods coincide with the onset of the commercial deep-water fishery in the late 1970s and the onset of the regulation of the fishery in the early 2000’s, which allowed us to investigate changes in the relationship between total demersal fish biomass and depth between the pre-and post commercial fishing periods, as well as changes in the biomass (kg km− 2) depth distribution and length frequency distribution of the most dominant fish species. Our results show a decline in total demersal fish biomass of 36% within the depth range of the commercial fishery (< 1500 m). Whilst there were significant declines in target (eg Coryphaenoides rupestris decreased by 57%) and non-target (eg C. guentheri and Antimora rostrata) species, not all species declined significantly. Changes in the overall length-frequency distribution were detected for 5 out of the 8 dominant species occupying depth ranges both within and outside the maximum depth for commercial trawling. This suggests that whilst there is evidence for likely fishery impacts on the biomass distribution of the demersal fish population as a whole, species-specific impacts are highly variable. It is clear that changes in population structure can extend beyond the depth at which fishing takes place, highlighting the importance for also considering the indirect effects on deep-sea fish populations.",Jasmin A Godbold and David M Bailey and MA Collins and John DM Gordon and Waldemar A Spallek and Imants G Priede,17,18205685009368968811,Biogeosciences,,,,"Putative fishery-induced changes in biomass and population size structures of demersal deep-sea fishes in ICES Sub-area VII, Northeast Atlantic Ocean",http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2164/3370/bg_10_529_2013.pdf?sequence=1,,2013,/scholar?cites=18205685009368968811,J2KWqAoAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C

As precipitation regimes may shift with changing climate in this area, droughts are predicted to increase in both frequency and degree of severity, which will have a significant impact on already drought-prone ecosystems. When modeling ecosystem responses to drought, it is important to consider the physiology of individual tree species since the variations in drought sensitivity among species is easily overlooked when plants are characterized using broad plant functional types. Here we explore the use of inherent water-use efficiency as an index of drought sensitivity in semi-arid young and mature ponderosa pine forests and a mesic mature Douglas-fir forest in the PNW.

The improvement of TL-LUEn over TL-LUE was relatively small in comparison with the improvement of TL-LUE over MOD17. However, the differences between TL-LUEn and MOD17, and TL-LUE and MOD17 became less distinct at the 8-day scale. As for different vegetation types, TL-LUEn and TL-LUE performed better than MOD17 for all vegetation types except crops at the half-hourly scale. At the daily and 8-day scales, both TL-LUEn and TL-LUE outperformed MOD17 for forests. However, TL-LUEn had a mixed performance for the three non-forest types while TL-LUE outperformed MOD17 slightly for all these non-forest types at daily and 8-day scales.

1018204,"Agricultural ecosystems differ in their ability to withstand drought and increases in temperature forecasted changes in climate and climate variability. Data metrics reflecting seasonal patterns in primary production (known as plant phenology) and links to environmental and or soil-related factors that drives those patterns are increasing in importance for sustaining agricultural production. What prompts crops and other vegetation to initiate growth? Are environmental drivers changing? If so, how might we adapt agricultural production to meet growing demands amidst increasing variability in climate? Standardized data metrics from widely distributed observations offer an approach to answering these questions. Digital cameras mounted on towers (hereafter “phenocams) provide detailed information about vegetation greenness.

1018206,"Forests play a crucial role in the global carbon (C) cycle by storing and sequestering a substantial amount of C in the terrestrial biosphere. Due to temporal dynamics in climate and vegetation activity, there are significant regional variations in carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between the biosphere and atmosphere in forests that are affecting the global C cycle. Current forest CO2 flux dynamics are controlled by instantaneous climate, soil, and vegetation conditions, which carry legacy effects from disturbances and extreme climate events. Our level of understanding from the legacies of these processes on net CO2 fluxes is still limited due to their complexities and their long-term effects. Here, we combined remote sensing, climate, and eddy-covariance flux data to study net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) at 185 forest sites globally. Instead of commonly used non-dynamic statistical methods, we employed a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), called Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) that captures information from the vegetation and climate’s temporal dynamics. The resulting data-driven model integrates interannual and seasonal variations of climate and vegetation by using Landsat and climate data at each site. The presented LSTM algorithm was able to effectively describe the overall seasonal variability (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE = 0.66) and across-site (NSE = 0.42) variations in NEE, while it had less success in predicting specific seasonal and interannual anomalies (NSE = 0.07).

Repeatable and accurate monitoring of terrestrial GPP is therefore critical for quantifying dynamics in regional-to-global carbon budgets. Remote sensing provides high frequency observations of terrestrial ecosystems and is 5 widely used to monitor and model spatiotemporal variability in ecosystem properties and processes that affect terrestrial GPP. We used data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and FLUXNET to assess how well four metrics derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices (hereafter referred to as proxies) and six remote sensing-based models capture spatial and temporal variations in annual 10 GPP. Specifically, we used the FLUXNET “La Thuile” data set, which includes several times more sites (144) and site years (422) than previous efforts have used. Our results show that remotely sensed proxies and modeled GPP are able to capture statistically significant amounts of spatial variation in mean annual GPP in every biome except croplands, but that the total variance explained differed substantially across 15 biomes (R 2≈ 0.1− 0.8).

In this study, a high resolution global analysis of temperature cycle shifts and their development over time is presented. We show that over the last 63 years, phase shifts in the annual near surface temperature cycle exhibit large spatiotemporal variability. The calculated phase shifts comprise earlier onsets of seasons as well as delays with similar frequencies, depending on location. From 1978 to 2010 Eastern Europe experienced an advanced annual cycle of near-surface temperature of 3.2 days while Eastern Australia shows an opposite shift towards later seasons of 3.5 days in comparison to the preceding 30-year period from 1948 to 1977. The largest phase shifts of –5.5 days toward earlier seasons over land were found in Belarus and Northwest Russia. For the first time the developments of seasonal temperature shifts were generalized for large areas by using self-organizing feature map neural networks resulting into 4 significant global trends. The temperature phase shifts are also shown to have strong correlations with the timing of shrub foliation observed at 57 phenological stations across the USA.

1018238,"We thank Lasslop et al.(2010) for their remarks and interest, and appreciate the opportunity to clarify our manuscript. Hopefully this attention will increase awareness of the issue of self-correlation in the CO2 flux community. There is currently a revival of the long-known concerns about self-correlation in the turbulence and boundary-layer community. Anderson (2009) suggests that because the degree to which self-correlation affects regression relationships is not simple to calculate in all cases, techniques that avoid the problem are preferred. Self-correlation (Hicks, 1978; Klipp and Mahrt, 2004; Baas et al., 2006; Toba et al., 2008) has also been referred to as spurious correlation (Pearson, 1897; Kenney, 1982; Kenney, 1991; Jackson and Somers, 1991; Aldrich, 1995; Brett, 2004), spurious inference or faulty inference (Prairie and Bird, 1989) and as the shared variable problem in the statistics literature (see additional references in Vickers et al., 2009). It arises when one group of variables is plotted against another, and the two groups have one or more variables in common. For example, x+ y and x are selfcorrelated because they share the common variable x. The degree of self-correlation is proportional to the ratio of the variances of the shared to the unshared variable. The relationship between the orientation of the self-correlation and of the true physical correlation is important. Depending on this relationship, selfcorrelation can be large or negligible. When the self-correlation is the same sign as the expected correlation and large enough, it can lead to false confidence in hypothesis testing. For variables suffering from self-correlation, the …",Dean Vickers and Christoph K Thomas and Jonathan G Martin and Beverly Law,4,17091622592932287810,Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,2,315,,Reply to the comment on Vickers et al.(2009): Self-correlation between assimilation and respiration resulting from flux partitioning of eddy-covariance CO 2 fluxes,http://terraweb.forestry.oregonstate.edu/sites/terraweb/files/Vickers_2009_reply_selfcor.pdf,150,2010,/scholar?cites=17091622592932287810,J2KWqAoAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC

1018243,"Fire influences carbon dynamics from local to global scales, but many uncertainties remain regarding the remote detection and simulation of heterogeneous fire effects. This study integrates Landsat-based re-mote sensing and Biome-BGC process modeling to simulate the effects of high-, moderate-, and low-severity fire on pyrogenic emissions, tree mortality, and net ecosystem production. The simulation area (244,600 ha) encompasses four fires that burned approximately 50,000 ha in 2002–2003 across the Metolius Watershed, Oregon, USA, as well as in situ measurements of postfire carbon pools and fluxes that we use for model evaluation. Simulated total pyrogenic emissions were 0.732 Tg C (2.4% of equivalent statewide anthropogenic carbon emis-sions over the same 2-year period). The simulated total carbon transfer due to tree mortality was fourfold higher than pyrogenic carbon emissions, but dead wood decomposition will occur over dec-ades. Immediately postfire, burned areas were a simulated carbon source (net C exchange:-0.076 Tg C y-1; mean±SD:-142±121 g C m-2 y-1). As expected, high-severity, stand-replacement fire had disproportionate carbon impacts. The per-unit area effects of moderate-severity fire were substantial, however, and the extent of low-severity fire merits its inclusion in landscape-scale analyses. These re-sults demonstrate the potential to reduce uncer-tainties in landscape to regional carbon budgets by leveraging Landsat-based fire products that account for both stand-replacement and partial disturbance.

Such thresholds are compared across four different sites. The height dependence of thresholds within the canopy is inverted compared to the one above grassland sites. This can be understood by extending the accepted interpretation for weak-wind thresholds from grassland sites to forested sites.Even for large fluctuations above the canopy, the fluctuations of the vertical wind velocity in the subcanopy remain small during weak-wind situations.

1018249," The impacts of drought intensities and vapor pressure deficits (VPD) beyond historic norms in Pacific Northwest (PNW), USA, are critical in understanding the potential future function and resilience of ecosystems in the region. While ecosystems in this region are adapted to seasonal droughts, June 2015 temperatures were the highest recorded in the region and strongly coupled with relatively low soil moisture. June is usually the best month for growth in the PNW. Here, we examined the impact of the June 2015 climate extremes on carbon and energy fluxes at sagebrush in the high desert, young and mature ponderosa pine in the semi-arid Great Basin, and Douglas-fir in the mesic Coast Range ecoregion compared to an average climate year (2014). We assessed if the ecosystems recover from extreme climate stress within the growing season. The monthly anomalies in temperature and VPD were 3 standard deviations, and precipitation was 1 standard deviation, outside the 30-year mean at all sites. In sagebrush, the carry-over effect of precipitation (i.e., intensive precipitation prior to the drought and heat) mitigated the immediate impact of extreme climate stress, leading to 25–40 % increase in net ecosystem production (NEP) and gross primary production (GPP), with little change in ecosystem respiration (RE) and 65 % increase in latent heat flux, compared to the June 2014. The drought and heat lowered NEP by 35–65 % and GPP by 15–33 % in ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir. A greater increase in latent heat flux was observed in Douglas-fir (110 %) than in ponderosa pine (< 10 %) driven by increased evaporation.

The threshold between the weak-wind and the strong-wind regime for the entire canopy is derived using the hockey stick-like dependence of the friction velocity on the mean advective wind speed.

Correspondingly, in the strong-wind regime, turbulence in the subcanopy remains strong in spite of reduced above-canopy turbulence.

The mean annual gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of the US over the period 2001–2012 were 6.84, 5.31, and 1.10 Pg C yr⁻ ¹, respectively; the mean annual GPP, ER, and NEP of Canada over the same 12-year period were 3.91, 3.26, and 0.60 Pg C yr⁻ ¹, respectively. The mean nationwide annual NEP of natural ecosystems over the period 2001–2012 was 0.53 Pg C yr⁻ ¹ for the US and 0.49 Pg C yr⁻ ¹ for the conterminous US Our estimate of the carbon sink for the conterminous US was almost identical with the estimate of the First State of the Carbon Cycle Report (SOCCR).

1018283,"Worldwide measurements of nearly 130 C3 species covering all major plant functional types are analysed in conjunction with model simulations to determine the effects of mesophyll conductance (gm) on photosynthetic parameters and their relationships estimated from A/Ci curves. We find that an assumption of infinite gm results in up to 75% underestimation for maximum carboxylation rate Vcmax, 60% for maximum electron transport rate Jmax, and 40% for triose phosphate utilization rate Tu. Vcmax is most sensitive, Jmax is less sensitive, and Tu has the least sensitivity to the variation of gm. Because of this asymmetrical effect of gm, the ratios of Jmax to Vcmax, Tu to Vcmax and Tu to Jmax are all overestimated. An infinite gm assumption also limits the freedom of variation of estimated parameters and artificially constrains parameter relationships to stronger shapes. These findings suggest the importance of quantifying gm for understanding in situ photosynthetic machinery functioning. We show that a nonzero resistance to CO2 movement in chloroplasts has small effects on estimated parameters. A non-linear function with gm as input is developed to convert the parameters estimated under an assumption of infinite gm to proper values.

1018284,"Predicting the net effects on the carbon and water balance of semi-arid forests under future conditions depends on ecosystem processes responding to changes in soil and atmospheric drought. Here we apply a combination of field observations and soil–plant–atmosphere modeling (SPA) to study carbon and water dynamics in a regenerating ponderosa pine forest. The effects of soil and atmospheric drought were quantified based on a field irrigation experiment combined with model simulations. To assess future effects of intensifying drought on ecosystem processes, the SPA model was run using temperature and precipitation scenarios for 2040 and 2080. Experimentally increased summer water availability clearly affected tree hydraulics and enhanced C uptake in both the observations and the model. Simulation results showed that irrigation was sufficient to eliminate soil water limitation and maintaining transpiration rates, but gross primary productivity (GPP) continued to decrease. Observations of stomatal conductance indicated a dominant role of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in limiting C uptake. This was confirmed by running the simulation under reduced atmospheric drought (VPD of 1 kPa), which largely maintained GPP rates at pre-drought conditions. The importance of VPD as a dominant driver was underlined by simulations of extreme summer conditions. We found GPP to be affected more by summer temperatures and VPD as predicted for 2080 (− 17%) than by reductions in summer precipitation (− 9%). Because heterotrophic respiration responded less to heat (− 1%) than to reductions in precipitation (− 10%), net ecosystem C uptake …",NK Ruehr and BE Law and D Quandt and M Williams,0,,,,,,LawBeverlyForestryEffectsHeatDrought. pdf,https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/articles/7w62fb139,,2017,,J2KWqAoAAAAJ:CYCckWUYoCcC

Correlations between postfire albedo and seedling, sapling, and snag (standing dead tree) density were investigated across fire severity classes and seasons for years 4-15 after fire. Albedo perturbation was 14 times larger in winter compared to summer and increased with fire severity class for the first several years. Albedo perturbation increased linearly with time over the study period. Correlations between albedo perturbations and the vegetation densities were strongest with snags, and significant in all fire classes in both summer and winter (R<-0.92, p< 0.01). The resulting annual radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere became more negative linearly at a rate of-0.86 W m⁻ ² yr⁻ ¹, reaching-15 W m⁻ ² in year 15 after fire.

We studied 80 forest types in 19 ecoregions, and found that the current carbon sink in 16 of these ecoregions is sufficiently strong that it cannot be matched or exceeded through substitution of fossil fuels by forest bioenergy. If the sink in these ecoregions weakens below its current level by 30-60 g C m-2 yr-1 due to insect infestations, increased fire emissions, or reduced primary production, management schemes including bioenergy production may succeed in jointly reducing fire risk and carbon emissions.

We modified the Community Land Model (CLM) 4.5 to produce 4km resolution forest carbon changes with drought, fire and management in the western US. We parameterized the model with species data using local plant trait observations for 30 species. To quantify uncertainty, we evaluated the model with data from flux sites, inventories and ancillary data in the region.

Although most focus is on air temperature, the radiative or skin temperature of plants is more relevant. Canopy skin temperature dynamics reflect biophysical, physiological, and anatomical characteristics and interactions with environmental drivers, and can be used to examine forest responses to stresses like droughts and heat waves. Direct measurements of plant canopy temperatures using thermocouple sensors have been challenging and offer limited information. Such measurements are usually conducted over short periods of time and a limited spatial extent of the canopy. By contrast, thermal infrared (TIR) imaging allows for extensive temporal and spatial measurement of canopy temperature regimes.

1018303,"The validity of land biosphere model outputs rely on accurate representations of ecosystem processes within the model. Typically, a vegetation or land cover type for a given area (several Km squared or larger resolution), is assumed to have uniform properties. The limited spacial and temporal resolution of models prevents resolving finer scale heterogeneous flux patterns that arise from variations in vegetation. This representation error must be quantified carefully if models are informed through data assimilation in order to assign appropriate weighting of model outputs and measurement data. The representation error is usually only estimated or ignored entirely due to the difficulty in determining reasonable values.

1018306,"Forest harvest regimes are changing as land managers cope with fires, drought, and insect damage. Thinning on public lands, typically focused on removal of small trees that could act as fuel ladders, is increasing to reduce risk of crown fires and reduce competition for water in crowded stands. On private lands, drought and wildfires could lead to further shortening of harvest cycles (eg from 80 to 45 years) or thinning. To examine the effects of potential changes in management regimes vs climate on carbon processes in forests of Oregon, California and Washington, we used data from ancillary plots, inventories, and satellites to parameterize and test the CLM4. 5 model.

Because of its dry summers, the PNW was sensitive to large‐scale climate perturbations in the past and may be vulnerable to climate change during the coming century. In this chapter we explore the resilience and vulnerability of PNW ecosystems with the MC1 vegetation model. MC1 was run with historical and future climates using a range of projections and model configurations. Fire frequency increased ubiquitously, but the domain remained a carbon sink in most scenarios because of increased productivity in nonsummer months.

In Oregon, forests older than 200 years now occupy less than 1 percent of private land that accounts for half the forest area, and ranges from 15 to almost 60 percent of public lands depending on the ecoregion. The Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) was implemented on public lands in 1993 as a region-wide forest management regime intended to conserve species at risk from extensive harvest of older forests.

Globally, ecosystem studies using FLUXNET data show that photosynthesis is~ 50% more sensitive to drought than respiration, leading to a decline in net carbon uptake (Schwalm et al. 2010). Experiments, primarily on potted plants, show that tree respiration responds less than photosynthesis to increased temperature because respiration acclimates while photosynthesis does not (Way & Oren 2010).

Avoiding optimistic completion times due to the characteristic Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) assumptions is a problem that can grow exponentially in complexity with the number of activities. A recursive technique that solves the problem in a polynomial number of steps has been developed, assuming that all duration times follow beta distributions. It is important to notice that the only two 100% valid approaches to calculate the project completion time are simulation and the stochastic sum for each and every path in the network.

First, the glaciations of the Neoproterozoic Era (1,000 to 542 Myr BP) were preceded by dramatically light 13C isotopic excursions preserved in pre-glacial deposits. Standard explanations of these excursions involve remineralization of isotopically light organic matter and imply strong enhancement of atmospheric CO2 greenhouse gas concentration, apparently inconsistent with the glaciations that followed. We propose a scenario in which the isotopic signal, as well as the global glaciation, result from changes to the ocean biology, possibly due to the evolution of microorganisms, specifically eukaryotes.

1018343,"[2] Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) is the total photosynthetic uptake or carbon assimilation by plants and is a key component of terrestrial carbon balance. GPP is the main carbon input to terrestrial ecosystems, noting relatively minor inputs by dissolved organic carbon, as well as deposition by rainwater and sedimentation [Chapin et al., 2006]. GPP depends on climate, climate variability, disturbance history, water and nutrient availability, soil type, species composition, and community structure. Understanding how these factors influence GPP remains a challenge due to complex interactions and the difficulty in quantitatively measuring GPP directly at various temporal and spatial scales. Estimates of GPP are only available at eddy covariance flux tower sites for the past decade, so we depend on models to estimate GPP over long periods of time at regional and global scales, and to project future changes in GPP in response to climate change.[3] Any error in simulated GPP will propagate through the model, introducing errors in simulated biomass and fluxes. If simulated GPP is too low or too high, then predicted leaf area index, wood biomass, crop yield, and soil biomass may also be too low or high [Schaefer et al., 2008]. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) is total ecosystem respiration (Reco) minus GPP, with a positive NEE indicating a net release of CO2 to the atmosphere. Autotrophic respiration depends on GPP and heterotrophic respiration depends on soil conditions and dead plant biomass, so errors in GPP readily propagate to errors in Reco and simulated diurnal and seasonal cycles of NEE.

1018344,"Eddy covariance flux research has relied on open-or closed-path gas analyzers for producing estimates of net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water vapor (H₂O). The two instruments have had different challenges that have led to development of an enclosed design that is intended to maximize strengths and minimize weaknesses of both traditional designs. Similar to the closed-path analyzer, the enclosed design leads to minimal data loss during precipitation events and icing, and it does not have surface heating issues. Similar to the open-path design, the enclosed design has good frequency response due to small flux attenuation loss in the short intake tube, does not need frequent calibration, has minimal maintenance requirements, and can be used in a very low power configuration. Another important feature of such a design is the ability to output instantaneous mixing ratio, or dry mole fraction, so that instantaneous thermal and pressure-related expansion and contraction, and water dilution of the sampled air have been accounted for. Thus, no density corrections should be required to compute fluxes during post-processing. Calculations of CO₂ and H₂O fluxes via instantaneous mixing ratio from the new enclosed CO₂/H₂O gas analyzer were tested in nine field experiments during 20092010 in a wide range of ecosystems and setups.

1018345,"We propose the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS), an upscaling approach to quantify global gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration using MODIS with a spatial resolution of 1-5 km and a temporal resolution of 8 days. This effort is novel because it is the first system that harmonizes and utilizes MODIS Atmosphere and Land products on the same projection and spatial resolution over the global land. This enabled us to use the MODIS Atmosphere products to calculate atmospheric radiative transfer for visual and near infrared radiation wave bands. Then we coupled atmospheric and canopy radiative transfer processes, with models that computed leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and transpiration on the sunlit and shaded portions of the vegetation and soil. At the annual time step, the mass and energy fluxes derived from BESS showed strong linear relations with measurements of solar irradiance (r (2)= 0.95, relative bias: 8%), gross primary productivity (r (2)= 0.86, relative bias: 5%) and evapotranspiration (r (2)= 0.86, relative bias: 15%) in data from 33 flux towers that cover seven plant functional types across arctic to tropical climatic zones.

The purpose of this work is to determine how much the scaling of the parameters from leaf to ecosystem level through a seasonally varying leaf area index (LAI) explains the parameter variation within and between PFTs. Using Fluxnet data, we simulate a seasonally variable LAI (F) for a large range of sites, comparable to the LAI M derived from MODIS. There are discrepancies when LAI F reach zero levels and LAI M still provides a small positive value. We find that temperature is the most common constraint for LAI [subecript F] in 55% of the simulations, while global radiation and vapor pressure deficit are the key constraints for 18% and 27% of the simulations, respectively, while large differences in this forcing still exist when looking at specific PFTs. Despite these differences, the annual photosynthesis simulations are comparable when using LAI F or LAI M(r²= 0.89). We investigated further the seasonal variation of ecosystem-scale parameters derived with LAI F. V cm has the largest seasonal variation. This holds for all vegetation types and climates.

1018347,"Eddy covariance flux measurements traditionally relied on open-path and closed-path gas analyzers for producing estimates of net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water vapor (H 2 O). The two instruments have had different challenges that have lead to development of an enclosed design that is intended to maximize strengths and minimize weaknesses of both traditional designs. Like the closed-path analyzer, the enclosed design leads to minimal data loss during precipitation events and icing, and it does not have surface heating issues. Like the open-path design, the enclosed design has good frequency response due to small flux attenuation loss in the short intake tube, does not need frequent calibration, has minimal maintenance requirements, and can be used in a very low power configuration.

1018359,"We present an inverse modeling framework designed to constrain CO2 budgets at regional scales. The approach captures atmospheric transport processes in high spatiotemporal resolution by coupling a mesoscale model with Lagrangian Stochastic backward trajectories. Terrestrial biosphere CO₂ emissions are generated through a simple diagnostic flux model that splits the net ecosystem exchange into its major components of gross primary productivity and autotrophic and heterotrophic respirations. The modeling framework assimilates state-of-the-art data sets for advected background CO₂ and anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions as well as highly resolved remote sensing products. We introduce a Bayesian inversion setup, optimizing a posteriori flux base rates for surface types that are defined through remote sensing information. This strategy significantly reduces the number of parameters to be optimized compared with solving fluxes for each individual grid cell, thus permitting description of the surface in a very high resolution. The model is tested using CO₂ concentrations measured in the fall and winter of 2006 at two AmeriFlux sites in Oregon. Because this database does not cover a full seasonal cycle, we focus on conducting model sensitivity tests rather than producing quantitative CO₂ flux estimates.

We sought to evaluate the extent that gross primary productivity, net ecosystem exchange, ecosystem respiration, net primary productivity, net ecosystem productivity, tree transpiration, and evapotranspiration varied seasonally and interannually in this ecosystem subjected to varying periods and severity of droughts. To explain variation, we found it necessary to define seasons functionally within a hydroecological year rather than by fixed calendar dates. The interannual variability in growing season length was large (45 days), and the end date was more variable than the onset. Plant-available soil water was the main determinant of carbon fluxes. Spring evapotranspiration primarily used shallow water, whereas summer and fall evapotranspiration drew water from deeper in the soil profile. A multiyear drought (2001–2003) had a more severe and fundamentally different impact on carbon and water cycles than a single-year (2005) drought because of carryover effects in soil water and carbohydrate reserves in plant tissue. Calendar year–based analysis was inadequate to diagnose drought years in precipitation and ecosystem drought response.

From 2005-2006, we examined bird communities in southwestern Oregon following post-fire logging of the 2002 Biscuit Fire, a landscape-scale (200,000-ha) mixed severity wildfire. Logging occurred in high-severity (stand-replacement) patches. Using point counts in logged and unlogged stands, we examined changes in densities and occurrence for 17 bird species at two spatial scales (20-ha and 2-ha) relative to two measures of salvage logging: proportion of area logged and logging intensity (proportion of basal area removed). The 20-ha scale comprised logging units as well as edges and surrounding unlogged areas while the 2-ha scale comprised only logging units.

1018371,"We use data from flux sites to examine patterns of response to disturbance among forest types. Forest development is punctuated by disturbances associated with fire and harvest, which reduces photosynthesis and possibly increases microbial respiration. After stand-replacing disturbance, NPP tends to be low in early succession and heterotrophic respiration may be high, low, or relatively similar to that of undisturbed areas depending on the disturbance characteristics. Effects of wildfire differ from harvest in that wildfire leaves more standing dead trees that can take decades to fall, and charring reduces decomposition potential. High intensity fires can reduce soil respiration for several years due to root mortality and reduced microbial activity. Clearcut harvesting adds a large amount of dead plant material to the forest floor immediately, which may be left on-site or partially remove through management activities …",B Law and A Noormets and J Grace,0,,AGUFM,,B32B-01,,The Effects of Disturbance on Forest Carbon Processes,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFM.B32B..01L/abstract,2007,2007,,J2KWqAoAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC

Where N is suboptimal, provision of N through fertilization or atmospheric deposition stimulates gross primary productivity (GPP) directly or by enabling forests to benefit from increased atmospheric CO2. Nitrogen deposition also enhances carbon sequestration, but the mechanisms via which this stimulation occurs have so far not been unravelled. Here we analyze observations from 133 forests to decipher how it influences the fate of the absorbed carbon. We find that N-deposition stimulate GPP which, in turn, results in an increase in biomass production (NPP). Whilst the increase in woody biomass production is proportional to the increase in GPP, a disproportional high amount of carbon is used for the production short-lived tissues such as roots and foliage, thereby increasing carbon-inputs to the soil.

Climate is known to affect forest NEP by directly controlling the physiology of production and decomposition of organic matter [Woodwell and Whittaker, 1968; Jarvis, 1995].[3] Conventional theory regarding the successional trends in NEP following disturbance is based on assumptions about the relative proportions of growing and …",JL Campbell and OJ Sun and BE Law,0,,,,,,Disturbance and net ecosystem production across three climatically,https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/journals/pnw_2007_campbell001.pdf,,2004,,J2KWqAoAAAAJ:hQUaER0FWQ4C

1018394,"One of the principal objectives of forest remote sensing is determining the component of the global carbon budget affected by forest biomass sequestration and change. Vegetation structure, as revealed by density profiles, is a key indicator of aboveground biomass and biomass change due to natural or anthropogenic disturbance. This paper tests the hypothesis that biomass is sensibly related to leaf area density (LAD), and evaluates the degree to which LAD can determine biomass. The LADS in this paper result from multialtitude radar interferometry from the NASA Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) and hyperspectral optical data from the NASA Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). AIRSAR was flown in interferometric mode, with vertical polarization, over Central Oregon at three different altitudes, 8 km, 5.6 km, and 2 km in July 2000 at C-band (wavelength= 5.6 cm). AVIRIS, with spectral channels spanning 500-2500 nm, was flown in July 2000 and June 1999. Multiple baselines are required to obtain the unnormalized vertical profile of the product of scatterer number density and backscattering amplitude squared. Plausible assumptions relate the profile of this product to the unnormalized leaf area density as a function of height. Because radar interferometric sensitivity is proportional to the baseline length over the radar altitude, multialtitude interferometry with a single baseline is equivalent to multiple baselines used for profiling. The relative profiles are normalized by the leaf area index determined from hyperspectral imaging with AVIRIS.

The thickness of each vegetation layer is estimated along with the ratio of the vegetation densities in the layers. A hyperspectral canopy radiative transfer model simulates the optical data, which leads to the estimation of the total canopy leaf area index (LAI)[3]. The microwave-derived density ratio parameter is combined with the total LA1 parameter to produce LAD.In the second method, a single physical model expresses the microwave interferometric amplitudes and phases and the hyperspectral reflectance factors in terms of vegetation structural parameters, including the two-level LAD. This second approach has the potential to be the most efficient and accurate use of the combined data set, but also requires more extensive integration of models.",R Treuhaft and G Anser and B Law,0,,,,,,Vegetation Structure from the Quanitative Fusion of Radar Interferometric and Hyperspectral Optical Remote Sensing,https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/handle/2014/18876/99-2174.pdf?sequence=1,,2000,,J2KWqAoAAAAJ:uDGL6kOW6j0C

1018402,"Radar interferometry enables the measurement of forest vegetation characteristics as a function of altitude above the ground surface [1, 2]. Along with techniques such as lidar [3] and low-frequency radar [4], radar interferometry is a candidate for estimating biomass using profiles of vegetation density. Introducing zero-baseline polarimetry does not improve the accuracy of vegetation parameter determination [5], without assumptions about the characteristics of the target, for example, about ground roughness. However, if polarimetric interferometry is also introduced at one or more baselines, polarimetric information can improve vegetation profiles. Because the sensitivity of interferometric phase as a function of vegetation scattering altitude is proportional to the baseline length over (wave length x radar altitude), varying the altitude is equivalent to varying the baseline. A data set of multialtitude polarimetric interferometry supplies a diverse number of observations from which vegetation profile parameters can be estimated.Polarimetric interferometric data were acquired with AIRSAR in June 1999 over Central Oregon at 3 altitudes, 8 km, 4 km, and 2 km at C-band. L-band interferometric data were also acquired at V polarization. Unlike multiple repeat-pass interferometry, the fixedbaseline measurement does not invoke the need to model temporal vegetation effects between passes. The end product of this analysis is quantitative parameter estimates and parameter estimate errors. The physical model used in the analysis consists of two layers of randomly oriented vegetation, and a direct and specularly-reflecting (primarily for L-band) ground surface …",R Treuhaft and G Asner and B Law,0,,,,,,Forest Vegetation Profiling with AIRSAR Polarimetric Radar Interferometry,https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/handle/2014/18874/99-2172.pdf?sequence=1,,2000,,J2KWqAoAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC

1018410,"We use the spatial version of a light use efficiency model, 3-PGS, to estimate net primary production (NPP) of the forests of western Oregon and evaluate the seasonal cycle and spatial patterns of environmental constraints on NPP. The model is parameterized with data that include soil surveys, physiological constants, spatially modeled climate data, and remotely sensed IPAR. We evaluate the performance of the model using a dataset of NPP developed from forest inventories as well as with estimates of productivity from eddy flux towers. We also evaluate the belowground carbon allocation scheme employed in the 3-PGS model. Overall the model tends to overestimate NPP at high productivity sites and underestimate productivity at moderate and low productivity sites. Belowground allocation as estimated by the model does not compare well with belowground allocation estimates from field estimates which varies with age differently in the xeric versus mesic ecoregions. The model suggests the NPP is constrained by environmental factors most in the xeric East Cascades (-2O% of potential productivity), less constrained in the West Cascades (45% of potential), and least constrained in the Coast Range (--6O% of potential). Coastal Range forests tend to be most limited climatically by temperatures sub-optimal for photosynthesis and summer VPD.

1018413,"In the Brazilian Amazon, where the forest sector plays a particularly important role in the economy [1], a better understanding of stem volume distribution is necessary to support those who manage forests for wood production during strategic planning, resource allocation and operational decisions. In addition, international agreements are underway for developing global observation systems to assess changes in forest biomass within countries, particularly tropical regions where deforestation contributes 12% of greenhouse gas emissions. It is part of the agreement on reducing deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). This requires advancing the integration of in situ observations and remote sensing techniques for operational monitoring (GEO Carbon Report 2009), which can be challenging in remote regions.It has been suggested that L-band, high incidence angle data from airborne SAR systems can be used to estimate stem volume in the Amazon forest with RMS errors of less than 15%[2]. The approach involves fitting regression models in which stem volume is predicted by using the combined information of multiple polarimetric attributes based on both power and phase measurements. In this study, we determine whether these models are still appropriate when using polarimetric data acquired by the L-band spaceborne radar PALSAR [3].

1018420,"Enclosed gas analyzer with short intake tube is a blend of a traditional long-tube closed-path design and a traditional open-path design. Analogous to closed-path, the enclosed design leads to minimal data loss during precipitation events and icing, and it does not have surface heating issues. Analogous to the open-path design, the enclosed design has good frequency response due to the short intake tube, does not require frequent calibration, needs minimal maintenance, and could be low power when used with short intake tube. In addition to these advantages, enclosed design could provide measurement of fast mixing ratio, or dry mole fraction, because native density measurements can be converted to mixing ratio units using fast measurements of temperature, water vapor and pressure inside the sampling cell. Fast mixing ratio implies that the thermal expansion and water dilution of the sampled air have been accounted for in such a conversion. Thus, no density corrections are required to compute fluxes when the fast mixing ratio is used. Such a way of calculating fluxes has been used frequently with traditional closed-path analyzers (eg, LI-6262 and LI-7000), because fast fluctuations in the air temperature of the sample were attenuated in the long intake tube, and because water vapor was simultaneously measured and dry mole fraction was output from the instrument.
