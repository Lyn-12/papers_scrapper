11000,"Are trust and risk important in consumers' electronic commerce purchasing decisions? What are the antecedents of trust and risk in this context? How do trust and risk affect an Internet consumer's purchasing decision? To answer these questions, we i) develop a theoretical framework describing the trust-based decision-making process a consumer uses when making a purchase from a given site, ii) test the proposed model using a Structural Equation Modeling technique on Internet consumer purchasing behavior data collected via a Web survey, and iii) consider the implications of the model. The results of the study show that Internet consumers' trust and perceived risk have strong impacts on their purchasing decisions. Consumer disposition to trust, reputation, privacy concerns, security concerns, the information quality of the Website, and the company's reputation, have strong effects on Internet consumers' trust in …",Dan J Kim and Donald L Ferrin and H Raghav Rao,3250,10287344687499703595,Decision support systems,2,544-564,North-Holland,"A trust-based consumer decision-making model in electronic commerce: The role of trust, perceived risk, and their antecedents",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923607001005,44,2008,/scholar?cites=10287344687499703595,y1pwDooAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC
11001,"Journal of Marketing Research, about a then-revolutionary phenomenon:“... over 90% of those surveyed stated that the major attraction of telephone shopping is its convenience...”[5]. The phenomenon of the Internet shopping today is very much akin to telephone shopping when this comment was originally made. Given that the Internet as a commercial vehicle is a relatively new concept, there is bound to be much uncertainty regarding the value of services it provides. The consumer makes his choices under conditions of uncertainty and therefore maximizes his or her expected benefit. 1 A large number of papers in marketing deal with decisionmaking under conditions of uncertainty [7, 10]. An underlying construct of our approach is that different individuals would have different levels of risk acceptance (or aversion). Again, this could depend on the demographic and characteristics of an individual—an Internet “savvy …",Amit Bhatnagar and Sanjog Misra and H Raghav Rao,1683,2222124597121796689,Communications of the ACM,11,98-105,ACM,"On risk, convenience, and Internet shopping behavior",https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/353360.353371,43,2000,/scholar?cites=2222124597121796689,y1pwDooAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C
11002,"Enterprises establish computer security policies to ensure the security of information resources; however, if employees and end-users of organisational information systems (IS) are not keen or are unwilling to follow security policies, then these efforts are in vain. Our study is informed by the literature on IS adoption, protection-motivation theory, deterrence theory, and organisational behaviour, and is motivated by the fundamental premise that the adoption of information security practices and policies is affected by organisational, environmental, and behavioural factors. We develop an Integrated Protection Motivation and Deterrence model of security policy compliance under the umbrella of Taylor-Todd's Decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of organisational commitment on employee security compliance intentions. Finally, we empirically test the theoretical model …",Tejaswini Herath and H Raghav Rao,1165,7304629169972680255,European Journal of Information Systems,2,106-125,Palgrave Macmillan UK,Protection motivation and deterrence: a framework for security policy compliance in organisations,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ejis.2009.6,18,2009,/scholar?cites=7304629169972680255,y1pwDooAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC
11003,"Trust and satisfaction are essential ingredients for successful business relationships in business-to-consumer electronic commerce. Yet there is little research on trust and satisfaction in e-commerce that takes a longitudinal approach. Drawing on three primary bodies of literature, the theory of reasoned action, the extended valence framework, and expectation-confirmation theory, this study synthesizes a model of consumer trust and satisfaction in the context of e-commerce. The model considers not only how consumers formulate their prepurchase decisions, but also how they form their long-term relationships with the same website vendor by comparing their prepurchase expectations to their actual purchase outcome. The results indicate that trust directly and indirectly affects a consumer's purchase decision in combination with perceived risk and perceived benefit, and also that trust has a longer term impact on …",Dan J Kim and Donald L Ferrin and H Raghav Rao,914,17784893593246895691,Information systems research,2,237-257,INFORMS,"Trust and satisfaction, two stepping stones for successful e-commerce relationships: A longitudinal exploration",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0188,20,2009,/scholar?cites=17784893593246895691,y1pwDooAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC
11004,"Secure management of information systems is crucially important in information intensive organizations. Although most organizations have long been using security technologies, it is well known that technology tools alone are not sufficient. Thus, the area of end-user security behaviors in organizations has gained an increased attention. In information security observing end-user security behaviors is challenging. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the end users have divergent security views. The inability to monitor employee IT security behaviors and divergent views regarding security policies, in our view, provide a setting where the principal agent paradigm applies. In this paper, we develop and test a theoretical model of the incentive effects of penalties, pressures and perceived effectiveness of employee actions that enhances our understanding of employee compliance to information security policies …",Tejaswini Herath and H Raghav Rao,871,10414589866335780500,Decision Support Systems,2,154-165,North-Holland,"Encouraging information security behaviors in organizations: Role of penalties, pressures and perceived effectiveness",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923609000530,47,2009,/scholar?cites=10414589866335780500,y1pwDooAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC
11005,"This study extends the view that formal contracts and relational governance function as complements rather than as substitutes. We investigate how specific characteristics of service level agreements (SLAs) impact relational governance in information technology outsourcing relationships. Eleven contractual elements (categorized into three SLA characteristics: foundation, change, and governance characteristics) are hypothesized to act as complements of three relational governance attributes: relational norms, harmonious conflict resolution, and mutual dependence. Data for the study were collected through a survey of South Korean IT executives. Results of the study support the fundamental proposition of complementarity between formal contracts and relational governance, and indicate that well-structured SLAs have significant positive influence on the various aspects of relational governance in IT outsourcing …",Jahyun Goo and Rajiv Kishore and H Raghav Rao and Kichan Nam,601,4735263696024909104,MIS quarterly,,119-145,"Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota",The role of service level agreements in relational management of information technology outsourcing: an empirical study,https://www.jstor.org/stable/20650281,,2009,/scholar?cites=4735263696024909104,y1pwDooAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC
11006,"Recent extreme events show that Twitter, a micro-blogging service, is emerging as the dominant social reporting tool to spread information on social crises. It is elevating the online public community to the status of first responders who can collectively cope with social crises. However, at the same time, many warnings have been raised about the reliability of community intelligence obtained through social reporting by the amateur online community. Using rumor theory, this paper studies citizen-driven information processing through Twitter services using data from three social crises: the Mumbai terrorist attacks in 2008, the Toyota recall in 2010, and the Seattle café shooting incident in 2012. We approach social crises as communal efforts for community intelligence gathering and collective information processing to cope with and adapt to uncertain external situations. We explore two issues: (1) collective social …",Onook Oh and Manish Agrawal and H Raghav Rao,496,373716963664339303,MIS quarterly,,407-426,"Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota",Community intelligence and social media services: A rumor theoretic analysis of tweets during social crises,https://www.jstor.org/stable/43825916,,2013,/scholar?cites=373716963664339303,y1pwDooAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC
