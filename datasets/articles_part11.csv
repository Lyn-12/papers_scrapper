11000,"Are trust and risk important in consumers' electronic commerce purchasing decisions? What are the antecedents of trust and risk in this context? How do trust and risk affect an Internet consumer's purchasing decision? To answer these questions, we i) develop a theoretical framework describing the trust-based decision-making process a consumer uses when making a purchase from a given site, ii) test the proposed model using a Structural Equation Modeling technique on Internet consumer purchasing behavior data collected via a Web survey, and iii) consider the implications of the model. The results of the study show that Internet consumers' trust and perceived risk have strong impacts on their purchasing decisions. Consumer disposition to trust, reputation, privacy concerns, security concerns, the information quality of the Website, and the company's reputation, have strong effects on Internet consumers' trust in …",Dan J Kim and Donald L Ferrin and H Raghav Rao,3250,10287344687499703595,Decision support systems,2,544-564,North-Holland,"A trust-based consumer decision-making model in electronic commerce: The role of trust, perceived risk, and their antecedents",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923607001005,44,2008,/scholar?cites=10287344687499703595,y1pwDooAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC
11001,"Journal of Marketing Research, about a then-revolutionary phenomenon:“... over 90% of those surveyed stated that the major attraction of telephone shopping is its convenience...”[5]. The phenomenon of the Internet shopping today is very much akin to telephone shopping when this comment was originally made. Given that the Internet as a commercial vehicle is a relatively new concept, there is bound to be much uncertainty regarding the value of services it provides. The consumer makes his choices under conditions of uncertainty and therefore maximizes his or her expected benefit. 1 A large number of papers in marketing deal with decisionmaking under conditions of uncertainty [7, 10]. An underlying construct of our approach is that different individuals would have different levels of risk acceptance (or aversion).

Our study is informed by the literature on IS adoption, protection-motivation theory, deterrence theory, and organisational behaviour, and is motivated by the fundamental premise that the adoption of information security practices and policies is affected by organisational, environmental, and behavioural factors.

11003,"Trust and satisfaction are essential ingredients for successful business relationships in business-to-consumer electronic commerce. Yet there is little research on trust and satisfaction in e-commerce that takes a longitudinal approach. Drawing on three primary bodies of literature, the theory of reasoned action, the extended valence framework, and expectation-confirmation theory, this study synthesizes a model of consumer trust and satisfaction in the context of e-commerce. The model considers not only how consumers formulate their prepurchase decisions, but also how they form their long-term relationships with the same website vendor by comparing their prepurchase expectations to their actual purchase outcome. The results indicate that trust directly and indirectly affects a consumer's purchase decision in combination with perceived risk and perceived benefit, and also that trust has a longer term impact on …",Dan J Kim and Donald L Ferrin and H Raghav Rao,914,17784893593246895691,Information systems research,2,237-257,INFORMS,"Trust and satisfaction, two stepping stones for successful e-commerce relationships: A longitudinal exploration",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1080.0188,20,2009,/scholar?cites=17784893593246895691,y1pwDooAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC

Although most organizations have long been using security technologies, it is well known that technology tools alone are not sufficient. Thus, the area of end-user security behaviors in organizations has gained an increased attention. In information security observing end-user security behaviors is challenging. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the end users have divergent security views. The inability to monitor employee IT security behaviors and divergent views regarding security policies, in our view, provide a setting where the principal agent paradigm applies.

We investigate how specific characteristics of service level agreements (SLAs) impact relational governance in information technology outsourcing relationships.

It is elevating the online public community to the status of first responders who can collectively cope with social crises. However, at the same time, many warnings have been raised about the reliability of community intelligence obtained through social reporting by the amateur online community. Using rumor theory, this paper studies citizen-driven information processing through Twitter services using data from three social crises: the Mumbai terrorist attacks in 2008, the Toyota recall in 2010, and the Seattle café shooting incident in 2012.

Recently, the theory of incomplete contracts (IC)[2, 9] has emerged; it owes its intellectual roots to TCE but is more rigorous. This theory focuses on property rights and the issues that arise when contracts are incomplete.According to TCE and IC, there are several factors that determine the efficient governance mode: asset specificity, uncertainty, potential number of vendors, and frequency, among others. Williamson [24] argues that individuals have a limited informationprocessing capacity in an uncertain world amid opportunistic behavior.(Each individual discloses information in a selective and distorted manner for his or her own interest.

Further, to study the relative importance of the dimensions between two expert groups (academics and practitioners), two semantic network and content analyses are conducted: one for academia's perspectives and another for practitioners' perspectives of trust in B-to-C electronic commerce.

We refine and validate the model using a sample of intended victims of an actual phishing attack. The data provides strong support for the model's theoretical structure and causative sequence. Overall, the model explains close to 50% of the variance in individual phishing susceptibility. The results indicate that most phishing emails are peripherally processed and individuals make decisions based on simple cues embedded in the email.

11026,"In the information society, it is important for firms to manage their core information resources securely. However, the difficulty of measuring the return on an IT security investment is one of the critical obstacles for firms in making such investment decisions. By utilizing event methodology, this study examines the value of an investment in IT security, based on stock market investors' behavior toward a firms' IT security investment announcements. Based on a sample of 101 investment announcements of firms whose stocks are publicly traded in the U.S. stock market between 1997 and 2006, we find substantial support for the hypotheses that information security investment leads to positive abnormal returns for firms. Interestingly, security investments with commercial exploitation tend to result in higher returns than those for IT security improvement.

However along with the adoption, there have been concerns about risky issues regarding privacy leakages and information sharing hazards. Such risks are partially due to the fact that seniors (knowingly or unknowingly) share private information that may be misused by others. In this paper we explore the privacy-preserving actions regarding information sharing for this demography on one social media platform — Facebook. Facebook is the largest social networking platform today and many of its privacy related practices have been in the news recently.
