Accordingly, we evaluated the concordance of PBC in a genetically defined population of twin sets and evaluated the clinical characteristics between concordant subjects. Methods: We identified 16 pairs of twins within a 1400-family cohort followed up by several centers worldwide, evaluated the diagnosis of PBC in all individuals, and determined the zygosity of sets reported as identical by the analysis of 2 highly variable HLA class II regions and 5 short tandem repeats.

We have taken advantage of a unique collection consisting of genomic DNA and mRNA from peripheral blood cells of female MZ twins (n=3 sets) and sisters of similar age (n=8 pairs) discordant for disease. We performed a genome-wide study to investigate differences in (i) DNA methylation (using a custom tiled 4-plex array containing tiled 50-mers 19,084 randomly chosen methylation sites), (ii) copy number variation (CNV) (with a chip including markers derived from the 1000 Genomes Project, all three HapMap phases, and recently published studies), and/or (iii) gene expression (by whole-genome expression arrays). Based on the results obtained from these three approaches we utilized quantitative PCR to compare the expression of candidate genes. Importantly, our data support consistent differences in discordant twins and siblings for the (i) methylation profiles of 60 gene regions, (ii) CNV of 10 genes, and (iii) the expression of 2 interferon-dependent genes.

1015178,"Background Perinatal or mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) results in a high frequency of chronic infection. Risk of mother-to-child transmission is associated with maternal viral factors including hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positivity and viral load.   Aim To investigate associations between age, HBeAg status, HBV DNA levels and genotype in female patients screened for inclusion into two contemporary, randomized HBV trials.   Methods Retrospective analyses focused on differences between women of childbearing age (≤44 years) and older women. Female patients (N = 355; 18–69 years) were included in the analysis: 41.7% of patients were Asian. In total, 44.4% were HBeAg-positive.   Results Significantly more women aged ≤44 years were HBeAg-positive compared to women ≥45 years (57.2% versus 27.5%, respectively, p<0.0001), this proportion declined with increasing age. Younger women were significantly more likely to have high HBV viral load (HBV DNA>108 copies mL: ≤44 years 46.0% vs ≥45 years 25.5%, respectively; p<0.0001), and this declined with increasing age. HBeAg positivity was slightly higher in Asian women, associated with a higher proportion of HBV genotypes B and C in this population. There was no obvious relationship between genotype and viral load.   Conclusions Women of childbearing age with CHB are more likely to have high HBV viral load and HBeAg positivity than older women; this likelihood decreases with age.

Roughly 1% of patients treated with G/P in Phase II or III clinical trials, across all genotypes, had virologic failure. These patients were offered enrollment into a retreatment study, MAGELLAN-3. Method: MAGELLAN-3 is an ongoing open-label, phase 3b trial to determine the efficacy and safety of G/P (300/120 mg once daily)+ sofosbuvir (SOF; 400 mg once daily)+ ribavirin (RBV; 1,000-1,200 mg daily, divided into two doses) in patients who had virologic failure on G/P treatment in an AbbVie-sponsored clinical trial. Patients who had non-GT 3 infection, without cirrhosis, and were naïve to NS3/4A protease and NS5A inhibitors prior to failure with G/P, received 12 weeks of treatment; all others received 16 weeks. Efficacy (percentage of patients with SVR12), safety, and baseline resistance were assessed. Patients with at least end-of-treatment (EOT) data are reported here. Results: Of 23 patients enrolled, 19 reached EOT; 2 patients were treated for 12 weeks (both reached EOT) and 21 were treated for 16 weeks (17 reached EOT).

1015227,"Background: HCV SPRINT-1 investigated a 4-week lead-in of PegIntron (P; 1.5 µg/kg/QW) plus Ribavirin (R; 800-1400 mg/day) prior to the addition of Boc (800 mg TID) for 24 or 44 weeks. Analysis of this data may lead to RGT paradigms.Methods: Viral response was assessed by Roche TaqMan (LLD= 15 IU/mL) at multiple time points including treatment weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, and 24 weeks post-treatment (sustained virologic response; SVR).Results: Patients were all G1 (1a> 1b) with 15% African-Americans, 7% cirrhotics, and 90% high viral load. W8 virology was available for all 103 patients in each arm. The majority of patients (64%) became negative by week 8 and SVR rates were similar for the long (94%) and short (82%) treatment arms (p= NS). In contrast, patients who first became negative between week 8 and 16, benefited from longer therapy (SVR 79% vs 21%; p= 0.004) but represented only 18% of the population. A third group never achieved undetectable HCV RNA by W16; this group primarily comprises null responders (11/18 in 48W arm) at week 4.Conclusions: The majority of patients (64%) had undetectable HCV RNA after 4 weeks of triple therapy following the lead-in and had a high rate of SVR (82%) following a shortened 28-week treatment duration. Only 18% of patients first achieving undetectable HCV RNA after week 8 and before week 16 of therapy benefited from a longer treatment regimen of 48 weeks.

Clinical decompensation represents a milestone event for the patient with cirrhosis, yet there remains uncertainty regarding precisely how to define this important phenomenon. With the development of broader treatment options for cirrhotic hepatitis patients, efficient identification of liver status before evolving to decompensated cirrhosis could be life-saving, but research on the topic has been limited by inconsistencies across studies, populations, and case-confirmation methods. We sought to determine whether diagnosis/procedure codes drawn from electronic health records (EHRs) could be used to identify patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Approximately 1% of patients treated in the G/P clinical trial program to date had virologic failure (VF) and no data have been presented on their outcomes following retreatment. These patients were enrolled into a retreatment study, MAGELLAN-3 (NCT02939989). Methods: MAGELLAN-3 is an ongoing phase 3b, open-label trial, in which patients who had VF following G/P were retreated with the combination of G/P 300 mg/120 mg once daily (QD)+ sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg QD+ ribavirin (RBV) 1,000-1,200 mg (weight based, twice daily).

In the past, Blacks had lower cure rates with interferon‐based regimens for HCV treatment compared to Whites. In the Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) era, recent published reports suggest Black patients achieve similar Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) rates with SOF‐based regimens in Real World Cohorts (RWC) as those observed in clinical trials including those who treated for 8 weeks. The aim of this analysis was to compare the efficacy of the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) in HCV genotype 1 Black patients in clinical trials to that observed in RWC. METHODS: In this descriptive analysis, data from the Phase 3 ION trials evaluating LDV/SOF is compared to five RWC. RWC were selected based on availability of data, non‐overlapping data sets, and treatment of at least 50 patients. The RWC include ASCEND, Burman's Specialty Pharmacy/Temple University, and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)(Baltimore, Cleveland, and National) and represent diverse patient populations from the US including academic centers, urban primary care settings and the VA. Baseline characteristics and efficacy were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 1079 patients treated in the ION 1, 2, and 3 trials, 308 were Black (16%) with the following baseline demographics: mean age (57 years), male (65%), GT 1a (70%), and treatment naïve (TN)(75%).

1015312,"To the Editor: Two studies in the November 19 issue, one by McHutchison et al. 1 and one by Davis et al., 2 were supported by Schering-Plough and show that combining interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin leads to better virologic and biochemical rates of response in patients with hepatitis C. The cost to the patient of a 48-week course of this drug combination (Rebetron, Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) is about $18,000. The side effects of an initial course of treatment are considerable: in the study by McHutchison et al., about two thirds of patients had influenza-like symptoms, and about one third each had nausea, depression, insomnia, and alopecia. 1 The only death reported in the two studies was the result of suicide. 2 In deciding whether the substantial cost and year-long decrement in the quality of life associated with this treatment are justified by future health benefits, patients, physicians, and payers need to know the extent to which treatment will ultimately affect clinically relevant outcomes, such as survival, liver failure, and liver cancer. A major limitation of the studies that neither the authors nor the editorialist3 mentions is that only short-term and intermediate outcomes were assessed. It is not clear to what extent, if at all, the higher rate of virologic response will translate into lower rates of cirrhosis, liver failure, liver transplantation, or death. Such a determination must be made on an intention-to-treat basis, with mortality rates compared in entire groups of patients who are randomly assigned to various treatments or to no treatment.

1015330,"Background and aims: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a progressive liver disease that leads to cirrhosis. Seladelpar, a selective PPAR delta agonist, demonstrates potent anti-cholestatic and anti-inflammatory activity in PBC. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of seladelpar in PBC patients with clinically diagnosed compensated cirrhosis. Method: PBC patients were enrolled into an ongoing, randomized, open-label Phase 2 study (EudraCT 2016-002996-91) and evaluated for the effect of oral seladelpar 5 and 10 mg. Eligible patients had inadequate response (alkaline phosphatase [AP]≥ 1.67× upper limit of normal (ULN)) or an intolerance to ursodiol and a total bilirubin≤ 2 mg/dL. Cirrhosis was diagnosed using liver biopsy, imaging tests, or liver elastography. After 12 weeks, patients on 5 mg were dose-escalated to 10 mg when the AP threshold was not met (5/10 mg group). The primary outcome was AP% change from baseline. Secondary outcome measures included AP responder analyses (< 1.67 xULN), changes in hepatic function, inflammatory markers, and pruritus using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Safety analysis included adverse events and laboratory parameters. Results: 119 patients were exposed to at least one dose of seladelpar, 26 of whom had compensated cirrhosis (5/10 mg n= 15 and 10 mg n= 11). Analysis was performed with a July 2018 data cut. At this time 15 of 26 cirrhotic patients received seladelpar for 3 months, 13 of 26 for 6 months, and 8 of 26 for 1 year.

Methods: The phenotype and function of γδ T cells were analyzed in 29 AHB patients, 28 CHB patients, and 30 healthy controls (HCs) using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofunctional assays. Results: Compared with HCs and CHB patients, decreased peripheral and increased hepatic γδ T cells associated with liver damage were found in AHB patients.

METHODS: A lifetime cost-effectiveness model was developed using discretely integrated condition event (DICE) simulation. Health and cost outcomes for the overall population and patient subgroups (eg treatment-naive and treatment-experienced) were analyzed separately. Inputs were obtained from published randomized trials and epidemiological/outcome studies, real-world database analyses and expert opinions. Model structure/assumptions/inputs were agreed by a group of clinical experts and health economists. As observed in the two pivotal trials, the model assumed similar HBV suppression and resistance rates between TAF and TDF, and improved ALT reduction and bone/renal safety with TAF. Efficacy and safety data for ETV were obtained from published studies. RESULTS: Over a lifetime, initiation of TAF was associated with fewer hepatic complications (cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation), renal and bone related events and deaths when compared to TDF and ETV, which resulted in higher quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient (0.02-0.34) on long-term projection. Total costs per patient with TAF were lower (-0.35% to-1.15%) compared with TDF and higher (3.1% to 4.0%) compared with ETV.

1015374,"Chronic HCV infection is a major health epidemic with up to 170 million people infected worldwide. Approximately 20% to 30% of all HCV patients will face life-threatening complications as a result of their disease. In industrialized countries, HCV accounts for 40% of cases of end-stage cirrhosis, 60% of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and 30% of liver transplants. Historically, standard-of-care treatment of genotype 1 HCV has been weekly injections of pegylated interferon with twice-daily oral ribavirin, or pegIFN/ribavirin, for 48 weeks of therapy. A host genetic marker near the IL28B gene has been shown to be an important predictor of which patients in the acute setting will clear HCV without treatment and which patients with chronic infection are likely to achieve SVR24. The most difficult to treat patients have the IL28B T/T genotype. Unfavorable IL28B genotypes occur at a higher frequency in African Americans and correlate significantly to the poor SVR24 rates observed in this group. The consistency of the IL28B effect on viral clearance without treatment in the acute setting as well as SVR24 rates in the chronic setting suggests that the different genotypes mark a difference in the underlying immune response characteristics of the patients.Recently, the addition of telaprevir or boceprevir to pegIFN/ribavirin has improved SVR24 to 65% to 75% using a shortened overall regimen. Despite these improvements, the addition of these agents adds toxicity to pegIFN/ribavirin therapy, which is associated with flu-like symptoms, depression, and decreased white and red blood cells.

Methods: This was a retrospective study from 2007-2015 of a 20% random sample of US Medicare beneficiaries and included NAFLD/NASH patients (ICD-9/10-CM codes) aged≥ 18 years. This study identified cohorts of CC, decompensated cirrhosis (DCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver transplant (LT) patients. ESLD was defined as the presence of DCC, HCC, or LT. Index date was defined as the earliest diagnosis (dx) date for each stage. Patients were followed from index date to earliest of 6 months, progression to different stage, death, end of coverage, or 12/31/2015. Annual costs were reported in 2015 USD. Generalized linear models were used to adjust for patients' baseline demographics and comorbidities. Results: Among 260,950 NAFLD/NASH patients (60% female), 3,454 (1.3%) had CC, and 25.6% had ESLD including 65,962 (25.3%) DCC, 421 (0.2%) HCC, and 473 (0.2%) LT. Mean ages for DCC (70.5) and HCC (72.5) were higher than CC (66.7) patients (both p< 0.001). Comorbidity burden was high, with at least 58% of CC and ESLD patients having all 3 conditions of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

1015392,"Background: NAFLD/NASH may progress to advanced liver diseases (ALD) that includes compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver transplant (LT). The study objective was to characterize the comorbidities, HCRU and associated costs among NAFLD/NASH patients with ALD. Methods: NAFLD/NASH patients aged≥ 18 years from 2006-2016 were identified retrospectively from a large US commercial and Medicare healthcare claims database using ICD-9/10-CM codes. Following the initial NAFLD/NASH diagnosis, development of CC, DCC, HCC or LT was identified using their first diagnosis date for each severity cohort (index date). Eligible patients were followed from index date to earliest of 6 months, progression to different cohort, end of coverage, or end of study period. Within each severity cohort, per member per month values were annualized to calculate the mean annual all-cause HCRU/costs as per 2016 USD. Results: This study identified 468,017 NAFLD/NASH commercial patients. Overall, 1.6%(7,665) had CC, 3.4%(15,833) had DCC, 0.09%(428) had HCC, and 0.1%(696) had LT. The comorbidity burden was high across all ALD cohorts-hypertension (36%-50%), hyperlipidemia (36%-45%), abdominal pain (34%-57%), type 2-diabetes (21%-42%). Allcause inpatient (IP) admissions and outpatient (OP) services were significantly higher for NAFLD/NASH patients with ALD than those without ALD (p< 0.001), with more than 50% of DCC and LT patients requiring IP admissions post diagnosis of liverstage.

1015393,"Background: Prior to the availability of Phase 1 drug interaction data, concomitant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use was prohibited in clinical trials of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL). Later clinical studies allowed for the use of up to 20 mg omeprazole or equivalent dosing. This analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of patients with and without compensated cirrhosis who received SOF/VEL for 12 weeks and reported concomitant use of a PPI. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of efficacy and safety data from 12 Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies in which patients of all genotypes with and without compensated cirrhosis received 12 weeks of SOF/VEL and reported concomitant use of a PPI. Efficacy was assessed by SVR12 and relapse rates and safety was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Results: 87 patients reported concomitant use of a PPI. The mean age (range) was 57 years (26-78), 79% were male and 75% were white; 56% of patients were infected with genotype 3 and 29% with genotype 1; 37% of patients had compensated cirrhosis and 39% were treatment experienced. The most common PPI was omeprazole reported by 68% of patients. The SVR12 rate was 97%(84 of 87 patients). Of the 3 patients who did not achieve SVR12, 2 patients relapsed (relapse rate 2%) and one patient with a history of diabetes discontinued SOF/VEL after 7 days of dosing due to hyperglycemia.

1015394,"Background. In a previous phase 2 study (NCT02609048), Seladelpar, a selective PPAR-δ agonist, demonstrated overt potent anti-cholestatic activity at doses of 50 and 200 mg/day in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients with an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). However, the study was terminated because of transaminase elevation. This study (NCT02955602) evaluates whether the efficacy of lower doses of Seladelpar can be retained without causing transaminase elevation. Methods. This open-label international study enrolls patients with PBC and an inadequate response to UDCA (alkaline phosphatase-AP-≥ 1.67 upper limit of normal), or an intolerance of UDCA. Patients are randomized to Seladelpar 5 mg or 10 mg per day for 26 weeks. A pre-specified interim analysis of safety and efficacy was conducted. The primary outcome of efficacy is the% change from baseline in AP. Secondary outcomes include absolute changes in AP, AP responder analyses; changes in other markers of cholestasis (γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase-GGT-, total bilirubin), alanine amino transferase (ALT), LDL-Cholesterol, C-reactive protein (hs-CRP); and pruritus evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS) and specific questionnaires. Safety analyses include discontinuation for safety, evaluation of adverse events, and routine laboratory markers. Results. There were no serious adverse events and no safety concerns with transaminase elevation.

1015395,"Background and aims: We used data from the Fibrotic Liver Disease (FOLD) Consortium—an established PBC cohort of over 4000 PBC cases drawn from 14.5 million patientts—to study trends in PBC prevalence and incidence, and risk of all‐cause mortality, among PBC patients under routine care in the US. Methods: Annual percentage change (APC) in PBC incidence and prevalence was estimated with join‐point Poisson regression. Differences associated with race, age, and gender were calculated with rate ratios (RR). Risk of all‐cause mortality was estimated using Cox regression with adjustment for patient characteristics and treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Propensity scores were used to adjust for treatment selection bias. Analyses were adjusted by study site. Results: Mean age of diagnosis in our racially‐diverse cohort of 3488 PBC patients (21% Hispanic; 8% African American; 7% Asian American) was 59 years. Mean follow‐up was 5 years. 70% received UDCA treatment. From 2006–2014, PBC prevalence increased from 21.7 to 39.2 per 100,000 persons. Adjusted APC (aAPC) differed by age, ranging from 3.0–7.5%(p< 0.05). Incidence was 3.7 per 100,000 person‐years in 2006, and 3.4 in 2014, with no trend detected (p= 0.09).
