17000,"A detailed description is reported of the analysis used by the CMS Collaboration in the search for the standard model Higgs boson in pp collisions at the LHC, which led to the observation of a new boson. The data sample corresponds to integrated luminosities up to 5.1 fb− 1 at TeV, and up to 5.3 fb− 1 at TeV. The results for five Higgs boson decay modes γγ, ZZ, WW, ττ, and bb, which show a combined local significance of 5 standard deviations near 125 GeV, are reviewed. A fit to the invariant mass of the two high resolution channels, γγ and ZZ→ 4ℓ, gives a mass estimate of 125. 3±0. 4 (stat.)±0. 5 (syst.) GeV. The measurements are interpreted in the context of the standard model Lagrangian for the scalar Higgs field interacting with fermions and vector bosons. The measured values of the corresponding couplings are compared to the standard model predictions.

17002,"This paper describes the CMS trigger system and its performance during Run 1 of the LHC. The trigger system consists of two levels designed to select events of potential physics interest from a GHz (MHz) interaction rate of proton-proton (heavy ion) collisions. The first level of the trigger is implemented in hardware, and selects events containing detector signals consistent with an electron, photon, muon, tau lepton, jet, or missing transverse energy. A programmable menu of up to 128 object-based algorithms is used to select events for subsequent processing. The trigger thresholds are adjusted to the LHC instantaneous luminosity during data taking in order to restrict the output rate to 100 kHz, the upper limit imposed by the CMS readout electronics. The second level, implemented in software, further refines the purity of the output stream, selecting an average rate of 400 Hz for offline event storage. The objectives, strategy and performance of the trigger system during the LHC Run 1 are described.",CMS collaboration,1415,6236594925451814496,arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02366,,,,The CMS trigger system,https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02366,,2016,/scholar?cites=6236594925451814496,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:D0NosnH9lYgC

17004,"Combined ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates, as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes, namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a  or a  boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the six decay modes , , and . All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The analysis uses the CERN LHC proton--proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb  at  TeV and 20 fb  at  TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the two experiments are combined within the context of three generic parameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions, and one on ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements with more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model prediction is measured to be 1.090.11. The combined measurements lead to observed significances for the vector boson fusion production process and for the  decay of  and  standard deviations, respectively.

Here we report a 3× draft genome sequence of ‘SunUp’papaya, the first commercial virus-resistant transgenic fruit tree 1 to be sequenced. The papaya genome is three times the size of the Arabidopsis genome, but contains fewer genes, including significantly fewer disease-resistance gene analogues. Comparison of the five sequenced genomes suggests a minimal angiosperm gene set of 13,311. A lack of recent genome duplication, atypical of other angiosperm genomes sequenced so far 2, 3, 4, 5, may account for the smaller papaya gene number in most functional groups.

17017,"At the Large Hadron Collider, the identification of jets originating from b quarks is important for searches for new physics and for measurements of standard model processes. A variety of algorithms has been developed by CMS to select b-quark jets based on variables such as the impact parameters of charged-particle tracks, the properties of reconstructed decay vertices, and the presence or absence of a lepton, or combinations thereof. The performance of these algorithms has been measured using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC and compared with expectations based on simulation. The data used in this study were recorded in 2011 at root s = 7TeV for a total integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb(-1). The efficiency for tagging b-quark jets has been measured in events from multijet and t-quark pair production. CMS has achieved a b-jet tagging efficiency of 85% for a light-parton misidentification probability of 10% in multijet events.

There was a net loss of bone at doses below 15 μg per day and a net gain at doses of 25 μg per day and above. At doses between 15 and 25 μg daily, bone was neither gained nor lost.The loss of bone with the low doses was due to expansion of the medullary cavity that was unaccompanied by any change in total bone width. There was no change in bone volume with the intermediate doses because endosteal resorption of bone was offset by periosteal apposition.

17022,"Classification of high-grade neuroendocrine tumours (HGNT) of the lung currently recognises large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) as distinct groups. However, a similarity in histology for these two carcinomas and uncertain clinical course have led to suggestions that a single HGNT classification would be more appropriate. Gene expression profiling, which can reproduce histopathological classification, and often defines new subclasses with prognostic significance, can be used to resolve HGNT classification.We used cDNA microarrays with 40386 elements to analyse the gene expression profiles of 38 surgically resected samples of lung neuroendocrine tumours and 11 SCLC cell lines.

It provides in clear, user-friendly form, tables which allow the calculation of the dates (and days) on which historical events have fallen or will fall, from AD 500 to 2100. It describes the calendars and other systems used for dating purposes in England from Roman times to the present, including regnal years. Lists of Easter dates, saints' days, popes, rulers of England and the Roman calendar are also given. In this updated and expanded edition, edited by Professor Michael Jones, the introductory materials for each set of tables has been revised. New tables for legal chronology, old and new style dates, Celtic Easter, adoption of Gregorian style, and the French Revolutionary calendar have been added, while the existing Anglo-Saxon regnal lists have been significantly revised.

17042,"Results are reported from a search for supersymmetry in p p collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, based on events with a single isolated lepton (electron or muon) and multiple jets, at least two of which are identified as b jets. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.3 fb− 1 recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2012. The search is motivated by supersymmetric models that involve strong-production processes and cascade decays of new particles. The resulting final states contain multiple jets as well as missing transverse momentum from weakly interacting particles. The event yields, observed across several kinematic regions, are consistent with the expectations from standard model processes. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified supersymmetric scenarios with pair production of gluinos, where each gluino decays to a top quark–antiquark pair and the …",Serguei Chatrchyan and Vardan Khachatryan and AM Sirunyan and A Tumasyan and Wolfgang Adam and T Bergauer and M Dragicevic and J Eroe and C Fabjan and M Friedl and R Fruehwirth and VM Ghete and N Hörmann and J Hrubec and M Jeitler and W Kiesenhofer and V Knünz and M Krammer and I Krätschmer and D Liko and I Mikulec and D Rabady and B Rahbaran and H Rohringer and R Schoefbeck and J Strauss and A Taurok and W Treberer-Treberspurg and W Waltenberger and C-E Wulz and V Mossolov and N Shumeiko and J Suarez Gonzalez and S Alderweireldt and M Bansal and S Bansal and Tom Cornelis and EA De Wolf and X Janssen and A Knutsson and S Luyckx and L Mucibello and S Ochesanu and B Roland and R Rougny and Z Staykova and H Van Haevermaet and P Van Mechelen and N Van Remortel and A Van Spilbeeck and F Blekman and S Blyweert and J D'Hondt and N Heracleous and A Kalogeropoulos and J Keaveney and S Lowette and M Maes and A Olbrechts and D Strom and S Tavernier and W Van Doninck and P Van Mulders and GP Van Onsem and I Villella and C Caillol and B Clerbaux and G De Lentdecker and L Favart and APR Gay and T Hreus and A Leonard and PE Marage and A Mohammadi and L Pernie and T Reis and T Seva and L Thomas and C Vander Velde and P Vanlaer and J Wang and Volker Adler and Kelly Beernaert and Leonardo Benucci and Anna Cimmino and Silvia Costantini and Sven Dildick and Guillaume Garcia and Benjamin Klein and Jeremie Lellouch and Andrey Marinov and Joseph McCartin and AA Ocampo Rios and Dirk Ryckbosch and Michael Sigamani and Nadja Strobbe and Filip Thyssen and Michael Tytgat and S Walsh and Efe Yazgan and Nikolaos Zaganidis and S Basegmez and C Beluffi and G Bruno and R Castello and A Caudron and L Ceard and GG Da Silveira and C Delaere and T du Pree and D Favart and L Forthomme and A Giammanco and J Hollar and P Jez and V Lemaitre and J Liao and O Militaru and C Nuttens and D Pagano and A Pin and K Piotrzkowski and A Popov and M Selvaggi and M Vidal Marono and JM Vizan Garcia and N Beliy and T Caebergs and E Daubie and GH Hammad and GA Alves and M Correa Martins Junior and T Martins and ME Pol and MHG Souza and WL Aldá Júnior and W Carvalho and J Chinellato and A Custodio and EM Da Costa and D De Jesus Damiao and C De Oliveira Martins and S Fonseca De Souza and H Malbouisson and M Malek and D Matos Figueiredo and L Mundim and H Nogima and WL Prado Da Silva and J Santaolalla,173,2328848711328238590,Physics Letters B,,328-353,North-Holland,"Search for supersymmetry in pp collisions at s= 8 TeV in events with a single lepton, large jet multiplicity, and multiple b jets",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026931400255X,733,2014,/scholar?cites=2328848711328238590,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:lPNvfOEJVFUC

The efficacy of high-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula in settings other than intensive care units (ICUs) is unclear.In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned infants younger than 12 months of age who had bronchiolitis and a need for supplemental oxygen therapy to receive either high-flow oxygen therapy (high-flow group) or standard oxygen therapy (standard-therapy group). Infants in the standard-therapy group could receive rescue high-flow oxygen therapy if their condition met criteria for treatment failure.

17044,"Induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a primary goal of HIV vaccine development. VRC01-class bnAbs are important vaccine leads because their precursor B cells targeted by an engineered priming immunogen are relatively common among humans. This priming immunogen has demonstrated the ability to initiate a bnAb response in animal models, but recall and maturation toward bnAb development has not been shown. Here, we report the development of boosting immunogens designed to guide the genetic and functional maturation of previously primed VRC01-class precursors. Boosting a transgenic mouse model expressing germline VRC01 heavy chains produced broad neutralization of near-native isolates (N276A) and weak neutralization of fully native HIV.

We have retained the overview of clinical reasoning in physiotherapy being hypothesis-oriented and collaborative, along with discussion of key factors within the therapist influencing clinical reasoning. To this we have added discussion of the biopsychosocially oriented World Health Organization (WHO) framework of health and disability (WHO 2001) that depicts the scope of knowledge, skills and clinical reasoning focus physiotherapists must have. We present a biopsychosocial, collaborative hypothesis-oriented model of clinical reasoning in practice along with the notion of dialectical reasoning strategies, and a framework of different hypothesis categories that can operate within that model. We contend that these reasoning tools can assist therapists’ application of biopsychosocial theory to practise in the spirit of the WHO framework and provide quality patient-centred physiotherapy services.",Mark A Jones and Gail Jensen and Ian Edwards,171,12489189371705641338,Clinical reasoning in the health professions,,245-256,Elsevier,Clinical reasoning in physiotherapy,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=oYPQAQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA245&dq=info:ekkZIZCDUq0J:scholar.google.com&ots=pSWbn3ldIi&sig=KGkCHYzVIbvplHiIDUNqMygkbhg,,2008,/scholar?cites=12489189371705641338,qNS0hDAAAAAJ:zBs7CkPFb0QC

17047,"A search is presented for additional neutral Higgs bosons in the τ τ final state in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The search is performed in the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM), using the data collected with the CMS detector in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb− 1. To enhance the sensitivity to neutral MSSM Higgs bosons, the search includes production of the Higgs boson in association with b quarks. No significant deviation above the expected background is observed. Model-independent limits at 95% confidence level (CL) are set on the product of the branching fraction for the decay into τ leptons and the cross section for the production via gluon fusion or in association with b quarks.
