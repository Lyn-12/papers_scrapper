To facilitate the access to these huge amounts of data and make these sources interoperable, two technologies may be combined: data warehousing and ontologies.

In the past decade, Data Warehouse Technology (DWT) has been successfully applied in several domains such as telecommunication, retail, finance and many other industries. It supports a wide range of applications throughout the enterprise. The DWT has been largely used to offer sustainable solutions for enterprises.

Passing from one phase to another requires important processes and decisions made by design actors. These decisions are usually lost once the DW is built. Tracing these decisions is a challenging issue. However, managing traceability in DW systems did not have the same spring as for software development.

1027027,"For more than 30 years, data warehouses (DW s) have attracted particular interest both in practice and in research. This success is explained by their ability to adapt to their evolving environment. One of the last challenges for DW s is their ability to open their frontiers to external data sources in addition to internal sources. The development of linked open data (LOD) as external sources is an excellent opportunity to create added value and enrich the analytical capabilities of DW s. However, the incorporation of LOD in the DW must be accompanied by careful management. In this paper, we are interested in managing the evolution of DW systems integrating internal and external LOD datasets. The particularity of LOD is that they contribute to evolving the DW at several levels:(i) source level,(ii) DW schema level, and (iii) DW design-cycle constructs. In this context, we have to ensure this co-evolution, as conventional evolution approaches are adapted neither to this new kind of source nor to semantic constructs underlying LOD sources. One way of tackling this co-evolution issue is to ensure the traceability of DW constructs for the whole design cycle. Our approach is tested using: the LUBM (Lehigh University BenchMark), different LOD datasets (DBepedia, YAGO, etc.), and Oracle 12c database management system (DBMS) used for the DW deployment.

1027048,"Résuméŕ Le développement des projets d’entreposage passe par les trois niveaux de conception: conceptuel, logique et physique. La phase de conception d’un entrepôt de données est reconnue actuellement comme un critère potentiel de réussite ou d’échec d’un projet d’entreposage. Nous proposons dans ce papier une méthode de conception d’entrepôts de données à base ontologique baptisée SISROM2C. L’ontologie, supposée existante, couvre l’ensemble des sources de données, sur laquelle sont exprimés un ensemble de besoins décisionnels. Un outil validant la méthode de conception proposée a été développé.",Selma Khouri and Ladjel Bellatreche,0,,,,,,SISRO M2C: une méthode de conception ontologique dřentrepôt de données,http://www.univ-msila.dz/ar/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/STIC09/articles/paper_33.pdf,,,,jTWw55gAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC
