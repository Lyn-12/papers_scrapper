1013000,"Microgrid (MG) is the indispensable infrastructure of nowadays smart grid, however, fluctuation and intermittence resulted from unstable micro-sources and nonlinear loads will execute considerable impacts on normal operation of the MG. Energy storage technology presents a preferable solution to the above issue. The paper gives a full scope review of the principal energy storage technologies being developed so far, and the features and benefits of energy storage systems (ESSs) within the MG are analyzed in details including ESS configuration and topologies, power electronics interfaces, ESS control schemes for charging/discharging, control strategy of hybrid ESS as well as optimization of the renewable sources and ESS. The future trends and challenges of ESS are also fully accounted, with a view to proposing smart ESS as the promising technology in the future for MG and smart grid.",Xingguo Tan and Qingmin Li and Hui Wang,532,4936999357652052910,International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems,1,179-191,Elsevier,Advances and trends of energy storage technology in microgrid,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061512003754,44,2013,/scholar?cites=4936999357652052910,siz6KbYAAAAJ:8dmKnlANe1sC

1013001,"We report a novel phase of carbon possessing a monoclinic C 2/m structure (8 atoms/cell) identified using an ab initio evolutionary structural search. This polymorph, which we call M-carbon, is related to the (2× 1) reconstruction of the (111) surface of diamond and can also be viewed as a distorted (through sliding and buckling of the sheets) form of graphite. It is stable over cold-compressed graphite above 13.4 GPa. The simulated x-ray diffraction pattern and near K-edge spectroscopy are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data [WL Mao et al., Science 302, 425 (2003)] on overcompressed graphite.

1013002,"In 5 recent years (2000–2004), the Changjiang (Yangtze) River has discharged past Datong (600 km from the river mouth) an average of ∼250 million tons (mt) of sediment per year, a decrease of more than 40% since the 1950s and 1960s, whereas water discharge at Datong has increased slightly. Water and sediment discharge data from the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the river suggest that the reduction of the Changjiang sediment load has occurred in two phases between 1950 and 2002: following the closure of the Danjiangkou Reservoir on the Hanjiang tributary in 1968 and following the installation of numerous dams and water‐soil conservation works in the Jialingjijang catchment after 1985.

In the context of the global warming, the annual mean surface temperature has significantly increased during the past 100 years, with slightly greater magnitude of temperature increase than the globe. The precipitation trends during the last 50 and 100 years are not obvious, but since 1956 it has assumed a weak increasing trend. The frequency and intensity of main extreme weather and climate events have also assumed significant change. The research has shown that the CO2 emission in China has continuously increased and the sum of positive radiative forcings produced by greenhouse gases is responsible for climate warming.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are thought to be involved in tumor progression and metastasis. Thus, we determined whether the expression of MMP‐9 and TIMP‐1 is associated with prognosis in breast cancer patients. We measured serum MMP‐9 and TIMP‐1 by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay in 60 breast cancer patients, 18 benign breast disease patients and 15 healthy controls. We also evaluated the expression of MMP‐9 and TIMP‐1 protein and mRNA in paraffin‐embedded tumor tissues from the 60 breast cancer patients by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.

1013006,"In this paper, we demonstrated the preparation and application of porous LiMn2O4 nanorods as cathode materials for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. Solid-state lithiation of porous Mn2O3 nanorods, resulting from thermal decomposition of MnC2O4 precursor, led to the formation of porous LiMn2O4 nanorods with high crystallinity and phase purity. Without surface modification, the as-synthesized porous nanorods exhibited superior high-rate capability and cyclability to the counterpart nonporous nanorods and nanoparticles. An initial discharge capacity of 105 mAh g−1 could be delivered at 10 C rate, and capacity retention of about 90% was obtained after 500 cycles at this high rate.

1013007,"Critical insights into the etiology of insulin resistance have been gained by the use of animal models where insulin action has been modulated by strictly controlled dietary interventions not possible in human studies. Overall, the literature has moved from a focus on macronutrient proportions to understanding the unique effects of individual subtypes of fats, carbohydrates and proteins. Substantial evidence has now accumulated for a major role of dietary fat subtypes in insulin action. Intake of saturated fats is strongly linked to development of obesity and insulin resistance, while that of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) is not. This is consistent with observations that saturated fats are poorly oxidized for energy and thus readily stored, are poorly mobilized by lipolytic stimuli, impair membrane function, and increase the expression of genes associated with adipocyte profileration (making their own home).

A pressing open problem in such systems is how to allow users to grant applications access to user-owned resources, e.g., to privacy- and cost-sensitive devices like the camera or to user data residing in other applications. A key challenge is to enable such access in a way that is non-disruptive to users while still maintaining least-privilege restrictions on applications. In this paper, we take the approach of user-driven access control, whereby permission granting is built into existing user actions in the context of an application, rather than added as an afterthought via manifests or system prompts.

In order to develop a robust automatic or semiautomatic classification system for PolSAR images, two important problems should be addressed: 1) incorporation of spatial relations between pixels; 2) estimation of the number of classes in the image. Therefore, in this paper, we present a novel superpixel-based classification framework with an adaptive number of classes for PolSAR images. The approach is mainly composed of three operations.

The current prevailing theory suggests that synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR (syn-and ex-NMDAR) impose counteracting effects on cell fate, and neuronal cell death is mainly mediated by the activation of ex-NMDAR. However, several lines of evidence implicate the limitation of this theory. Here, we demonstrate that activation of NMDAR bi-directionally regulated cell fate through stimulating pro-survival or pro-death signaling.

Among all the kernels available for OCSVM, the Gaussian kernel is the most commonly used one. The selection of Gaussian kernel parameters influences greatly the performances of classifiers, which remains as an open problem. In this paper two methods are proposed to select Gaussian kernel parameters in OCSVM: according to the first one, the parameters are selected using the information of the farthest and the nearest neighbors of each sample; using the second one, the parameters are determined via detecting the “tightness” of the decision boundaries.

To study how watching 3DTV influences mental fatigue and to investigate the related objective indicators, we use physiological detectors to record EEGs of 10 individual subjects both before and after watching 2D or 3D television. The 2D/3D changes of both energy values of EEG in the four wavebands, namely alpha (α), beta (β), theta (θ), delta (δ), and four fatigue-related algorithms (α + θ)/β, α/β, (α + θ)/(α + β) and θ/β, were compared and analyzed. The results show that the parameters for the 3DTV group, except theta rhythm, changed more significantly than those for the 2DTV groups in some brain regions.

The rapid increase began in Bed 25 of the Meishan section (GSSP of the Permian–Triassic boundary, PTB), and coincided closely with the latest Permian extinction.

We have developed a glioma-targeted drug delivery system based on graphene oxide. Targeted peptide chlorotoxin-conjugated graphene oxide (CTX-GO) sheets were successfully synthesized and characterized. Doxorubicin was loaded onto CTX-GO (CTX-GO/DOX) with high efficiency (570 mg doxorubicin per gram CTX-GO) via noncovalent interactions. Doxorubicin release was pH-dependent and showed sustained-release properties. Cytotoxicity experiments demonstrated that CTX-GO/DOX mediated the highest rate of death of glioma cells compared with free doxorubicin or graphene oxide loaded with doxorubicin only.

1013134,"Due to its relatively low cost, high hydrogen yield, and environmentally friendly hydrolysis byproducts, magnesium hydride (MgH 2) appears to be an attractive candidate for hydrogen generation. However, the hydrolysis reaction of MgH 2 is rapidly inhibited by the formation of a magnesium hydroxide passivation layer. To improve the hydrolysis properties of MgH 2-based hydrides we investigated three different approaches: ball milling, synthesis of MgH 2-based composites, and tuning of the solution composition. We demonstrate that the formation of a composite system, such as the MgH 2/LaH 3 composite, through ball milling and in situ synthesis, can improve the hydrolysis properties of MgH 2 in pure water. Furthermore, the addition of Ni to the MgH 2/LaH 3 composite resulted in the synthesis of LaH 3/MgH 2/Ni composites. The LaH 3/MgH 2/Ni composites exhibited a higher hydrolysis rate—120 mL/(g· min) of H 2 in the first 5 min—than the MgH 2/LaH 3 composite—95 mL/(g· min)—without the formation of the magnesium hydroxide passivation layer. Moreover, the yield rate was controlled by manipulation of the particle size via ball milling. The hydrolysis of MgH 2 was also improved by optimizing the solution. The MgH 2 produced 1711.2 mL/g of H 2 in 10 min at 298 K in the 27.1% ammonium chloride solution, and the hydrolytic conversion rate reached the value of 99.5%.

1013143,"Code injection attacks are a top threat to today's Internet. With zero-day attacks on the rise, randomization techniques have been introduced to diversify software and operation systems of networked hosts so that attacks that succeed on one host cannot succeed on others. Two most notable system-wide randomization techniques are instruction set randomization (ISR) and address space layout randomization (ASLR). The former randomizes instruction set for each process, while the latter randomizes the memory address space layout. Both suffer from a number of attacks.

1013144,"Human diets rely on natural resource availability and can reflect social and cultural values. When environments, societies, and cultures change, diets may also shift. This study traced the extent of dietary change and the factors influencing such change. Through stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic analysis of late Neolithic and early Bronze Age human and animal bone collagen, we found that significant shifts in human diets were closely associated with intercontinental cultural exchanges in Eurasia and climate change in northwestern China. The isotopic evidence indicated that human diets mainly consisted of C4 foodstuffs (presumably millet and/or animals fed with C4 foods) around 4000 calibrated years before the present (cal yr BP), corresponding to the flourishing of millet agriculture in the context of the optimal climate conditions of the mid-Holocene.

It was found that interspherulitic phase segregation of PBA takes place at high temperature, e.g. 100 °C, for all blend compositions due to the high diffusion length. On the contrary, no interspherulitic phase segregation of PBA at 75 °C occurs at all, consistent with a shorter diffusion length. It was further found that the PBA melt acted as a diluter, affecting the morphology of PBS, which in turn influenced the phase separation behavior of PBA remarkably. At 100 °C, with increasing PBA concentration, the resultant open structure of PBS caused by the diluting effect of the PBA melt makes it necessary to retain some portion of the PBA melt between the PBS lamellae.

1013165,"A compact planar ultrawideband antenna with continuously tunable, independent band notches for cognitive radio applications is presented. The antenna is fabricated using a copper-cladded substrate. A radiating patch with an inverted rectangular T-slot is etched on the top side of the substrate. A straight rectangular strip with a complete gap is embedded into the T-slot. By placing a single varactor diode across this gap, a frequency-agile band-notch function below 5 GHz is realized. On the bottom side of the substrate, a U-shaped parasitic element having an interdigitated-structure is placed beneath the radiating patch. The second narrow band notch is created by inserting a second varactor diode into the gap on one leg of the parasitic element. It has a frequency-agile performance above 5 GHz.

1013166,"We sought to characterize the regenerated cells, if any, when photoreceptor ablation was mostly limited to a particular cone subtype. This allowed us to uniquely assess whether the remaining cells influence specification of regenerating photoreceptors. The ability to replace lost photoreceptors via stem cell therapy holds promise for treating many retinal degenerative diseases. Zebrafish are potent for modelling this because they have robust regenerative capacity emanating from endogenous stem cells, and abundant cone photoreceptors including multiple spectral subtypes similar to human fovea. We ablated the homolog of the human S-cones, the ultraviolet-sensitive (UV) cones, and tested the hypothesis that the photoreceptors regenerating in their place take on identities matching those expected from normal cone mosaic development. We created transgenic fish wherein UV cones can be ablated by addition of a prodrug. Thus photoreceptors developed normally and only the UV cones expressed nitroreductase; the latter converts the prodrug metronidazole to a cell-autonomous neurotoxin. A significant increase in proliferation of progenitor cell populations (p<0.01) was observed when cell ablation was primarily limited to UV cones. In control fish, we found that BrdU primarily incorporated into rod photoreceptors, as expected. However the majority of regenerating photoreceptors became cones when retinal cell ablation was predominantly restricted to UV cones: a 2-fold increase in the relative abundance of cones (p = 0.008) was mirrored by a 35% decrease in rods.

1013168,"AIM: To investigate the effect and possible mechanism of ulinastatin on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 45-min bilateral renal ischemia, treated with intravenously 12 500 U ulinastatin at 30 min prior to ischemia and at the beginning of reperfusion, compared with a nontreated group without ulinastatin and a sham-operation group without bilateral renal ischemia. After 0 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h of reperfusion, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were measured for the assessment of renal function, renal sections were used for histologic grading of renal injury, for immunohistochemical localization of Bcl-2 and heat shock protein 70. Renal ultrastructure was observed through a transmission electron microscope. RESULTS: Ulinastatin significantly reduced the increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine produced by renal ischemia-reperfusion, suggesting an improvement in renal function. Ulinastatin reduced the histologic evidence of renal damage associated with ischemia-reperfusion and accompanied with an up-regulation in the expression of Bcl-2 protein, but it had no significent effect on the expression of HSP 70. Ulinastatin also significantly reduced kidney ultrastructure damage caused by renal ischemia-reperfusion.

When the ratio of C/ZrO2 = 0, the reinforcements are mainly composed of Al3Zr particles and α-Al2O3 particles, and it is suggested that the dominant wear mechanism is abrasive wear. The wear resistance of the composites is not satisfactory due to the low mechanical strength and brittleness of the Al3Zr phase. When the C/ZrO2 ratio increases from 0 to 1, the wear resistance is significantly improved by the increased volume fraction of α-Al2O3 and decreased volume fraction of Al3Zr, plus newly formed nanosized ZrC particles.

In this paper, a reversible image steganographic scheme based on predictive coding is proposed by embedding secret data into compression codes during the lossless image compression. The proposed scheme effectively provides a lossless hiding mechanism in the compression domain. During the predictive coding stage, the proposed scheme embeds secret data into error values by referring to a hiding-tree. In an entropy decoding stage, the secret data can be extracted by referring to the hiding-tree, and the host image can be recovered during the predictive decoding stage. The experimental results show that the average hiding capacity of the proposed scheme is 0.992 bits per pixel (bpp), and the …",Hsien-Chu Wu and Hao-Cheng Wang and Chwei-Shyong Tsai and Chung-Ming Wang,52,7889817485736831042,Displays,1,35-43,Elsevier,Reversible image steganographic scheme via predictive coding,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141938209000596,31,2010,/scholar?cites=7889817485736831042,siz6KbYAAAAJ:afsF9h1fxg0C

1013184,"In order to improve the precision of the simulation system in a star sensor, this paper presents a gray pervasion method based on a Gaussian law for precisely simulating star spots and a Gaussian centroid extraction algorithm. The gray vaiues of simulating star image pixels are evaluated according to the 2D Gaussian distribution law and the mapping coordinates instead of the central pixel round coordinates are taken as the symmetric center, so as gray pervasion phenomenon caused by defocusing and aberration from an actual star spot can be simulated precisely. The new Gaussian centroid extracting sub-pixel positioning method consists of two steps. One is rough pixel-level positioning and the other is fine deviation positioning. A piecewise defined synthesized function is constituted based on Gaussian law to realize the sub-pixel fine deviation positioning. Under the simulating condition of image Gaussian noise in N (0, 1.22) and the whole deviation interval of [-0.5, 0.5) pixel, the Gaussian centroid positioning precision is 0.007 pixel, which is far less than 0.041 pixel from the gray-weighted centroid method and 0.026 pixel from the square-gray weighted centroid method.

It was found that PEA forms a regular banded structure within the temperature range 23 °C to 36 °C, otherwise only Maltese-cross spherulites are observed. The banded PEA spherulites exhibit a double ring feature with band spacing between two equivalent birefringent rings increasing with temperature. The ring extinction in PEA banded spherulites is caused by a lamellar twist. There exist two equivalent positions in one twisting period, which show no birefringence. The PBS can also grow in ring-banded spherulites in a wide temperature window with the high temperature threshold for forming banded structures that are not sharply delineated, as in the case of PEA.

As the SEM imaging exhibited, Pt nanoparticles are uniformly deposited on the surface of each RGO sheet, performing an alternative covering structure of RGO and Pt nanoparticle multi-layer on the CF electrode. Thus, a novel three-dimensional (3D) multi-layered Pt/RGO modified CF electrode (N–Pt/RGO/CF) is obtained. Experimental results demonstrate that the prepared N–Pt/RGO/CF electrode shows good electrochemical properties and enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward methanol electrooxidation in alkaline medium as compared with the Pt/RGO/CF electrode without layer-by-layer structure or the Pt/CF electrode without RGO.

1013206,"Shigella flexneri is the major pathogen causing bacillary dysentery in developing countries. S. flexneri is divided into at least 16 serotypes based on the combination of antigenic determinants present in the O-antigen. All the serotypes (except for serotype 6) share a basic O-unit containing one N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and three l-rhamnose residues, whereas differences between the serotypes are conferred by phage-encoded glucosylation and/or O-acetylation. Serotype Xv is a newly emerged and the most prevalent serotype in China, which can agglutinate with both MASF IV-1 and 7,8 monoclonal antibodies. The factor responsible for the presence of MASF IV-1 (E1037) epitope has not yet been identified. In this study, we analyzed the LPS structure of serotype Xv strains and found that the MASF IV-1 positive phenotype depends on an O-antigen modification with a phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) group attached at position 3 of one of the rhamnose residues. A plasmid carried gene, lpt-O (LPS phosphoethanolamine transferase for O–antigen), mediates the addition of PEtN for serotype Xv and other MASF IV-1 positive strains. These findings reveal a novel serotype conversion mechanism in S. flexneri and show the necessity of further extension of the serotype classification scheme recognizing the MASF IV-1 positive strains as distinctive subtypes.",Qiangzheng Sun and Yuriy A Knirel and Ruiting Lan and Jianping Wang and Sof’ya N Senchenkova and Dong Jin and Alexander S Shashkov and Shengli Xia and Andrei V Perepelov and Qiang Chen and Yan Wang and Haiyin Wang and Jianguo Xu,49,16755310599795141120,,9,e46095,Public Library of Science,A Novel Plasmid-Encoded Serotype Conversion Mechanism through Addition of Phosphoethanolamine to the O-Antigen of Shigella flexneri,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046095,7,2012,/scholar?cites=16755310599795141120,siz6KbYAAAAJ:rhSvDnGaX0QC

In this study, we performed ‘loss of function’ studies by depleting activated HSCs with gliotoxin.

1013250,"Skeletal metastases occur commonly, and frequently are complicated by the development of an impending or pathologic fracture. In the majority of instances, these patients are best treated by internal stabilization, frequently supplemented by methylmethacrylate, to relieve pain and maintain the patient's mobility. The underlying tumor may continue to grow, and if this occurs the progressive lysis may result in loosening and subsequent failure of the implant. To prevent additional local growth, postoperative radiotherapy is recommended, and many patients also receive endocrine or chemotherapy, but the adjuvant therapy is not always successful in preventing progressive local tumor induced osteolysis. It is possible that the addition of chemotherapeutic agents to the methylmethacrylate may inhibit local growth. This study was performed to determine the biomechanical, biologic, and systemic effects of adding methotrexate to methylmethacrylate. The results show that the addition of methotrexate in as much as a concentration of 2 g methotrexate per 40 g cement did not significantly alter the biomechanical characteristics of the bone cement. The incorporated methotrexate was released continuously from the loaded bone cement, and in the amount and concentration used did not have any toxic effects on the host animal. The methotrexate did not appear to be affected by the heat of polymerization and had a significant systemic effect.

However, the molecular mechanisms for Al detoxification and accumulation are still poorly understood. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis of Al tolerance and accumulation, we used the Illumina high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology to conduct a genome-wide transcriptome analysis on both tip and basal segments of the roots exposed to Al. By using the Trinity method for the de novo assembly and cap3 software to reduce the redundancy and chimeras of the transcripts, we constructed 39,815 transcripts with an average length of 1184 bp, among which 20,605 transcripts were annotated by BLAST searches in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that expression of genes involved in the defense of cell wall toxicity and oxidative stress was preferentially induced by Al stress. Our RNA-seq data also revealed that organic acid metabolism was unlikely to be a rate-limiting step for the Al-induced secretion of organic acids in buckwheat. We identified two citrate transporter genes that were highly induced by Al and potentially involved in the release of citrate into the xylem.

The subjects included 110 severe obese cases aged 7–17y and 110 normal-weight controls matched by age and gender for measurement of blood DNA methylation levels at the HIF3A gene locus using the Sequenom’s MassARRAY system. We observed significantly higher methylation levels in obese children than in controls at positions 46801642 and 46801699 in HIF3A gene (P<0.05), and found positive associations between methylation and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels adjusted by gender, age and BMI at the position 46801699 (r = 0.226, P = 0.007). These results suggest that HIF3A DNA methylation is associated with childhood obesity, and has a BMI-independent association with ALT. The results provide evidence for identifying epigenetic factors of elivated ALT and may be useful for risk assessment and personalized medicine of liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",Shuo Wang and Jieyun Song and Yide Yang and Yining Zhang and Haijun Wang and Jun Ma,41,14498136425830039217,PloS one,12,e0145944,Public Library of Science,HIF3A DNA Methylation Is Associated with Childhood Obesity and ALT,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145944,10,2015,/scholar?cites=14498136425830039217,siz6KbYAAAAJ:PlWzFYVEG4EC

Here we document a novel, conserved and specific genetic interaction between the proteins that underlie these diseases, amyloid-β precursor protein and prion protein, APP and PRP, respectively. Knockdown of APP and/or PRNP homologs in the zebrafish (appa, appb, prp1, and prp2) produces a dose-dependent phenotype characterized by systemic morphological defects, reduced cell adhesion and CNS cell death. This genetic interaction is surprisingly exclusive in that prp1 genetically interacts with zebrafish appa, but not with appb, and the zebrafish paralog prp2 fails to interact with appa. Intriguingly, appa & appb are largely redundant in early zebrafish development yet their abilities to rescue CNS cell death are differentially contingent on prp1 abundance.

1013274,"NS1 of influenza A virus is a key multifunctional protein that plays various roles in regulating viral replication mechanisms, host innate/adaptive immune responses, and cellular signalling pathways. These functions rely on its ability to participate in a multitude of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. To gain further insight into the role of NS1, a tandem affinity purification (TAP) method was utilized to find unknown interaction partner of NS1. The protein complexes of NS1 and its interacting partner were purified from A549 cell using TAP-tagged NS1 as bait, and co-purified cellular factors were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). We identified cellular β-tubulin as a novel interaction partner of NS1. The RNA-binding domain of NS1 interacts with β-tubulin through its RNA-binding domain, as judged by a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay with the GST-fused functional domains of NS1. Immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that NS1 with β-tubulin co-localized in the nucleus. In addition, the disruption of the microtubule network and apoptosis were also observed on NS1-transfected A549 cells.

The diversity differed greatly between river-connected and-isolated lakes. Connected lakes were most speciose, especially potamophilus taxa, such as Rivularia spp, Semisulcospira spp and-Unionidae. In the two largest connected lakes, Lake Poyanghu and Lake Dongtinghu, the species numbers were 53 and 57, accounting for 76.8% and 82.6% of the total, respectively. In contrast, molluscs in isolated lakes were very species-poor, each with 4-19 species. Quantitative analysis indicated changes on relative abundance of two predominant species (Bellamya purificata and Corbicula fluminea) were consistent with connectivity of research lakes. By calculation of conservation value indices, threatened status of 67 species was evaluated. The results showed that the current status of molluscan fauna in Yangtze Lakes was grim.

1013294,"The relationship between the boreal spring (or the austral autumn) Antarctic Oscillation (AAO)(March–April) and the West African summer monsoon (WASM)(June–September) is analyzed based on NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. The results show that the linkage of the boreal spring AAO to the WASM exhibits decadal-scale variations: a strong connection between the two appears over the period 1985–2006 and a weak connection over the period 1970–1984. Further analysis indicates that such an unstable relationship between the two results from the modulation by ENSO events to a large extent.A possible mechanism for the impacts of the boreal spring AAO on the WASM is also discussed. The variability of the boreal spring tropical South Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) appears to serve as a bridge linking these two systems. The boreal spring AAO produces an anomalous SST over the tropical South Atlantic by exciting an equatorward Rossby wave train over the western Southern Hemisphere (SH). This AAO-related SST anomaly modulates the meridional gradient of moist static energy (MSE) between the Sahel and the Guinea-tropical Atlantic region in the boreal spring. The MSE gradient is of paramount importance for the changes from spring to summer in the West African monsoon because its relaxation along the seasonal cycle is linked to the northward excursion of the WASM system into the African continent. Therefore, an anomalous AAO-related MSE gradient can lead to anomalous Sahel rainfall in the early summer.

In the past few decades, many significant methods to construct the two important motifs have been subsequently developed. Traditionally, the synthesis of benzoxazoles involves two approaches. One is the metal-catalyzed intramolecular O-arylation of o-haloanilides.[5] Another method mainly involves the condensation of 2-aminophenol derivatives with carboxylic acids or carboxylic halides under strong-acid/high-temperature conditions.[6] These methods are successful, however, the uneasily available precursors and undesired byproducts can limit their wide applications, which thus stimulates chemists to search for more effective processes.Aldehydes are important and common building blocks, and they are easily prepared from readily available materials.

Two kinds of cationic surfmers, containing single or double hydrophobic tails (octyl chains or benzyl groups), and the corresponding homopolymers were synthesized. The antimicrobial activity of these candidate antibacterials was studied by microbial growth inhibition assays against Escherichia coli, and hemolysis activity was carried out using human red blood cells. It was interestingly found that the homopolymers were much more effective in antibacterial property than their corresponding monomers.

The Qijia culture, found in northwest China, is one of the key archaeological cultures that can shed light on trans‐Eurasian exchange because a variety of imports are found in this cultural context. These imports include new cereals and animals, which suggest that human diets may also have changed compared with previous periods.

Inhibiting ER stress is a major therapeutic target/strategy in treating cardiovascular diseases. Our previous studies revealed that lycopene exhibits great pharmacological potential in protecting against the I/R-injury in vitro and vivo, but whether attenuation of ER stress (and) or ER stress-induced apoptosis contributes to the effects remains unclear. In the present study, using neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes to establish an in vitro model of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) to mimic myocardium I/R in vivo, we aimed to explore the hypothesis that lycopene could alleviate the ER stress and ER stress-induced apoptosis in H/R-injury. We observed that lycopene alleviated the H/R injury as revealed by improving cell viability and reducing apoptosis, suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and improved the phosphorylated AMPK expression, attenuated ER stress as evidenced by decreasing the expression of GRP78, ATF6 mRNA, sXbp-1 mRNA, eIF2α mRNA and eIF2α phosphorylation, alleviated ER stress-induced apoptosis as manifested by reducing CHOP/GADD153 expression, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, caspase-12 and caspase-3 activity in H/R-treated cardiomyocytes.

The large tunability of 38.5% in the resonance wavelength stems from the different excitation conditions of magnetic resonance mediated by plasmon in metallic VO2 but optical phonons in dielectric VO2.

1013350,"Global policies that regulate anthropogenic mercury emissions to the environment require quantitative and comprehensive source–receptor relationships for mercury emissions, transport and deposition among major continental regions. In this study, we use the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model to establish source–receptor relationships among 11 major continental regions worldwide. Source–receptor relationships for surface mercury concentrations (SMC) show that some regions (eg, East Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Europe) should be responsible for their local surface Hg (II) and Hg (P) concentrations due to near-field transport and deposition contributions from their local anthropogenic emissions (up to 64 and 71% for Hg (II) and Hg (P), respectively, over East Asia). We define the region of primary influence (RPI) and the region of secondary influence (RSI) to establish intercontinental influence patterns. Results indicate that East Asia is the SMC RPI for almost all other regions, while Europe, Russia, and the Indian subcontinent also make some contributions to SMC over some receptor regions because they are dominant RSI source regions. Source–receptor relationships for mercury deposition show that approximately 16 and 17% of dry and wet deposition, respectively, over North America originate from East Asia, indicating that transpacific transport of East Asian emissions is the major foreign source of mercury deposition in North America.

This avoids the non-convexity of empirical risk minimization, but game sizes are exponential in the number of predicted variables.

1013461,"Since the batch dataset is often organized as a special three-way array, i.e. (batches × variables × time), the research of data-based batch process monitoring has attracted much attention.

Thus, the original batch process data can be transformed into a two-way manner (batches × functions of the variable trajectories) by describing each variable trajectory as a function. The FDD-based batch process monitoring method not only is effective to distinguish the subtle differences in the shape of variables’ trajectories between normal batches and faulty batches, but also can easily handle some off-line data preprocessing steps, such as recovery of the missing data and trajectory alignment.

1013497,"Exploration drilling is venturing into deeper regions of water. During the exploration of these deeper water depths, large hydrocarbon deposits have been found below salt formations. These reservoirs are called “presalts,” which are below the salt formations. Presalt reservoirs have been found in offshore Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), West Africa, and the North Sea. Completions in salt formations can be difficult because of the creep behavior that the salt formations exhibit. Creep behavior results from the instability of the salt formation, which causes a slow flow and permanent deformations. Creep deformation occurs over time and begins once the salt formation has been penetrated. Completion of the wellbore does not stop formation creep. The constant creep of the salt formation causes excess stress on the wellbore casing, which may eventually cause the casing to collapse. In this study, a 3D geomechanical …",HanYi Wang and Robello Samuel,25,18372468247216293510,SPE Drilling & Completion,04,261-272,Society of Petroleum Engineers,3D geomechanical modeling of salt-creep behavior on wellbore casing for presalt reservoirs,https://www.onepetro.org/journal-paper/SPE-166144-PA,31,2016,/scholar?cites=18372468247216293510,siz6KbYAAAAJ:0wD49__q8KEC

1013509,"Barnacles are one of the most common organisms in intertidal areas. Their life cycle includes seven free-swimming larval stages and sessile juvenile and adult stages. The transition from the swimming to the sessile stages, referred to as larval settlement, is crucial for their survivor success and subsequent population distribution. In this study, we focused on the involvement of calmodulin (CaM) and its binding proteins in the larval settlement of the barnacle, Balanus ( = Amphibalanus) amphitrite. The full length of CaM gene was cloned from stage II nauplii of B. amphitrite (referred to as Ba-CaM), encoding 149 amino acid residues that share a high similarity with published CaMs in other organisms. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that Ba-CaM was highly expressed in cyprids, the stage at which swimming larvae are competent to attach and undergo metamorphosis. In situ hybridization revealed that the expressed Ba-CaM gene was localized in compound eyes, posterior ganglion and cement glands, all of which may have essential functions during larval settlement. Larval settlement assays showed that both the CaM inhibitor compound 48/80 and the CaM-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) inhibitor ML-7 effectively blocked barnacle larval settlement, whereas Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitors did not show any clear effects.

1013516,"Chrysin, a flavonoid compound existing in several plants, is applied as a dietary supplement because of its beneficial effects on general human health and alleviation of neurological disorders. However, mechanisms underlying neuroprotection of chrysin has not been fully elucidated, and the effects of chrysin on the Parkinson’s disease (PD) model in vivo have not been investigated. It is here shown that chrysin protects primary granular neurons against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion insult via antiapoptosis by reversing the dysregulated expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase 3.

1013517,"With the increasing wide use of hydraulic fractures in the petroleum industry, it is essential to accurately predict the behavior of fractures based on the understanding of fundamental mechanisms governing the process. For effective reservoir exploration and development, hydraulic fracture pattern, geometry and associated dimensions are critical in determining well stimulation efficiency. In shale formations, non-planar, complex hydraulic fractures are often observed, due to the activation of preexisting natural fractures and the interaction between multiple, simultaneously propagating hydraulic fractures. The propagation of turning non-planar fractures due to the interference of nearby producing wells has also been reported.

This phenomenon is known as the “stoichiometric knife edge.” While previous models have captured this phenomenon, they do not explicitly track P in the producer or in the media that supports the producer, which brings questions to the validity of their predictions.

1013540,"Within the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory we study the dynamic properties of current-carrying superconducting strips in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. We found pronounced voltage peaks as a function of the magnetic field, the amplitude of which depends both on sample dimensions and external parameters. These voltage oscillations are a consequence of moving vortices, which undergo alternating static and dynamic phases. At higher fields or for high currents, the continuous motion of vortices is responsible for the monotonic background on which the resistance oscillations due to the entry of additional vortices are superimposed. Mechanisms for such vortex-assisted resistance oscillations are discussed.

Such a shift is reflected in their macroinvertebrate assemblages, which may serve as good indicators of long-term changes in such lake ecosystems. We conducted a survey of benthic macroinvertebrates in 20 lakes in the Yangtze floodplain that were disconnected from the river channel to identify invertebrate response patterns along a gradient of eutrophication. Macroinvertebrate assemblages changed in parallel to the observed regime shift of a subgroup of those lakes. The most abundant groups were epiphytic invertebrates (e.g., Bithyniidae) in the macrophyte-dominated lakes and pollution-tolerant invertebrates (e.g., Tubificidae, Tanypus) in the phytoplankton-dominated lakes.

To investigate how the edge centrality characterises the community structure, they develop an approach based on the edge antitriangle centrality with the isolated vertex handling strategy (EACH) for community detection.

We find that the lowest order of this system to yield chaos is 3.903. Based on fractional-order stability theory, synchronization is achieved by using nonlinear feedback control method. Simulation results show the scheme is effective and a chaotic secure communication scheme is present based on this synchronization.

For the diffusive part, the temporal discretization is performed by the backward difference method which yields an implicit scheme and the spatial discretization is performed by the standard Galerkin method. The convective part can be discretized using the characteristic Galerkin method and solved explicitly. The driven square flow and backward-facing step flow are conducted to validate the model.

In the present study, we investigated the expression levels of MAD2B in human gliomas and normal brain tissues, and determined whether depletion of MAD2B enhanced the sensitivity of glioma cells to ionizing radiation. Using reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis, MAD2B was found to be overexpressed in glioma specimens compared with normal brain tissue. Silencing of MAD2B markedly reduced clonogenic survival of glioma cells and significantly enhanced apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation.

The key step of the repair reaction is a light‐driven electron transfer from the FADH− cofactor to the dimer; the resulting radical anion splits spontaneously. Whether the splitting reaction requires considerable activation energy is still under dispute. Recent reports show that the splitting reaction of a dimer radical anion has a significant activation barrier (0.45 eV), and so photolyases have to provide considerable energy. However, these results contradict observations that cis–syn dimer radical anions split into monomers at −196 °C, and that the full process of DNA photoreactivation was fast (1.5–2 ns).

The recent attention for Big Data illustrates that organizations are aware of the potential of the torrents of data generated by today's information systems. However, at the same time, organizations are struggling to extract value from this overload of data. Clearly, there is a need for data scientists able to transform event data into actionable information. To do this, it is crucial to take a process perspective. The ultimate goal of BPI is not to improve information systems or the recording of data; instead the focus should be in improving the process.

Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were assessed at rest and on passive mobilization by acute pain service blinded to analgesic treatment. Nausea and vomiting, dizziness, satisfaction and other side-effects were assessed postoperatively. RESULTS: There was significantly less VAS scores in the CFNB group comparing the CIA group at rest 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48 h after surgery (P< 0.01). A significant difference in VAS scores was found in CFNB group vs CIA group on passive mobilization 24, 36, 48 h after operation (P< 0.01). There was significantly less dizziness, nausea and vomiting in the CFNB group (P< 0.01). Patient satisfaction was higher in the CFNB group (92.1%) than the CIA group (20.6%)(P< 0.01).

1013667,"To improve protein digestibility of aqueously extracted soy proteins, an effective chemical treatment under mild conditions is needed. Soy proteins, including storage protein glycinin and antinutritional factors such as trypsin inhibitors, are rich in disulfide bonds. Reduction of these disulfide bonds by incubating soy proteins with sodium sulfite and sodium metabisulfite at 55 °C showed no net increase of free sulfhydryl groups after dialysis to remove the residual reducing agent. However, the in vitro digestibility measured by trypsin hydrolysis using the pH-Stat method was significantly increased. Sodium metabisulfite (SMBS) was more effective in increasing in vitro digestibility than sodium sulfite at the same molar concentration.

1013679,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The frequent association of gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia in gastric cancer (GC) might preclude serologic detection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in GC. By using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection, we would like to determine whether there exists a subset of genuinely H. pylori-negative GC patients, and whether they have distinct clinicopathologic features or not. METHODOLOGY: IgG antibodies against H. pylori were determined by ELISA in sera, and H. pylori DNA was detected by PCR in resected gastric specimens from 160 GC patients. Clinicopathologic characteristics were then compared among group A: seropositive, group B: seronegative but PCR-positive, and group C: seronegative and PCR-negative. RESULTS: Among 160 patients, 105 (65.6%) were classified as group A, 25 (15.6%) as group B, and 30 (18.8%) as group C. Group B patients were older and had more infiltrative tumor growth than group A. Group C had a significantly higher frequency of female predominance, and their cancers were of a more cardiac location and of the diffuse histologic subtype than those of groups A and B. CONCLUSIONS: A significant portion (15.6%) was negative to ELISA but positive to PCR, suggesting that older ages and infiltrative tumor growth might preclude serologic detection of H. pylori infection by impairing humoral responses.

1013687,"Octamer binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), a member of the POU family, is an essential factor for maintaining the pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Oct4 is also the core transcription factor being used to induce somatic cells into the induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (1). Oct4 is mainly expressed in the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocyst, postimplantation embryonic epiblast and the primordial germ cells (2, 3), in which the expression of Oct4 is precisely regulated. Two-fold upregulation or suppression of Oct4 expression can cause ES cells to lose pluripotency and differentiate into trophectoderm or other germ layer lineages (3-5). Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP, also known as tumor protein translationally-controlled I, TPT1) is highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed among eukaryotic cells and tissues. TCTP has been implicated in important cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis (6, 7). In addition, the TCTP gene contains two important motifs including the TCTP1 motif (AA. 48-58) and TCTP2 motif (AA. 129-151)(8). Several proteins, such as GCNF (9), SF1 (10), LRH1 (11), Sall4 (12), and HIF-2 (13), could regulate the Oct4 promoter region in cultured cells or in later embryonic development.

Different arrangements of cyclones affect the separator performance greatly. For a 600 MW supercritical CFB boiler, the experimental and numerical studies on the arrangement of 6 cyclones were conducted. The experimental results show that the pressure drops and corresponding solid flow rates of the 6 cyclones are different. The pressure drop as well as the corresponding solid flow rate of the cyclone in the center is smaller than that of the other two in the same side of the furnace. The numerical results show that the distribution of the gas phase is uniform, while the solid flow distribution is significantly non-uniform. Corresponding with the experimental results, the solid flux of the inlet duct in the center is smaller than that of the other two in the same side of the furnace.

1013699,The conventional isoconversional plot of ln(β/T2) versus 1/T usually has a large error of about −10% in calculation of the pre-exponential factor as a consequence of assuming h(x)=1. Iterative calculation using the plot of ln(β/hT2) versus 1/T is thus suggested. It is illustrated that the iterative method can greatly improve calculation for the pre-exponential factor. Success in calculation for the pre-exponential factor is accompanied by an enhanced accuracy in value of activation energy given by the iterative method in comparison with the conventional isoconversional plot of ln(β/T2) versus 1/T.

1013711,"Nonresolving inflammation is one of the consistent features of the tumor microenvironment in the intestine and plays a critical role in the initiation and development of colon cancer. Here we reported the inhibitory effects of GEN-27, a new derivative of genistein, on the inflammation-related colon cancer cell proliferation and delineated the mechanism of its action. The results indicated that GEN-27 inhibited the proliferation of human colon tumor HCT116 cells stimulated by culture supernatants of LPS-induced human monocytes THP-1 cells and significantly decreased LPS-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β in THP-1 cells. The HCT116 cell proliferation elicited by THP-1-conditioned medium could be blocked by the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). Further mechanistic study revealed that GEN-27 remarkably inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-B and phosphorylation of IB and IKK/ in both HCT116 and THP-1 cells. In addition, GEN-27 markedly suppressed the HCT116 cell proliferation stimulated by IL-1β treatment, which was dependent on the inhibition of NF-κB/p65 nuclear localization, as verified by p65 overexpression and BAY 11-7082, an NF-B inhibitor.

Microscopically the livers of TS rats showed massive granular degeneration, chronic inflammation, and portal fibrosis. Mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum swelling and loss of membrane integrity were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The similar, but milder, morphological changes were observed in the livers of TS&RT rats. Serum biochemistry analysis revealed that the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were significantly higher (p<0.05) in TS rats than in controls. The levels of ALT and AST in TS&RT rats were slightly lower than in RT rats, but they were insignificantly higher than in controls. However, both TS and TS&RT rats had significantly lower levels (p<0.05) of serum glucose and hepatic glycogen than in controls.

1013731,"Lung cancer during pregnancy is rare, although the number of case reports has been increasing in recent years. Herein, we describe two cases of lung carcinoma complicating pregnancy with different presentations and outcomes, and review the relevant literature. The first case involved a 31-year-old patient with squamous cell carcinoma with multiple bone metastases. The initial symptoms were productive cough and dyspnea on exertion during the second trimester of pregnancy, to which the patient paid little attention. Chemoradiation was started 1 month postpartum, soon after the diagnosis was made, but with little response. She died at home several days after palliative radiotherapy. The second case involved a 34-year-old patient with poorly differentiated lung carcinoma with brain metastasis. Left hemiparesis had developed initially during the third trimester.

The 3'end sequence of CMV-HZ01S10 originally isolated from Cucurbita moschata in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, was obtained with RT-PCR products. This isolate was then found belonging to CMV sub-group I according to its amino acid similarity of coat protein. With 32P labeled probes for ZYMV and CMV, occurrence of these two viruses of natural infection from Zhejiang Province was investigated by RNA spot hybridization, with samples collected from fixed fields respectively. ZYMV and CMV exhibited obvious seasonal differences for their natural occurrence. CMV was found to be the main virus in summer, only some C. moschata and Cucumis melo were found to be infected by ZYMV. However ZYMV was prevalent in autumn. Pathogenic tests for ZYMV and CMV were compared on varieties of Cucurbita pepo (Zaoqing Yidai), Luffa cylindrica (Zhongchang) and Cucumis sativus (Jinglu 4) by inoculation of seedlings in greenhouse, and obvious difference of symptoms exhibited among the varieties tested. The tested variety of L. cylindrica was more sensitive to the infection of CMV, and the tested C. pepo was more sensitive to ZYMV infection.

However, due to data sparsity, the finite sample estimation at tail quantiles often suffers from high variability. To improve the tail estimation efficiency, we consider modeling multiple quantiles jointly for cases where the quantile slope coefficients tend to be constant at the tails. We propose two estimators, the weighted composite estimator that minimizes the weighted combined quantile objective function across quantiles, and the weighted quantile average estimator that is the weighted average of quantile-specific slope estimators.

Both the low- and middle-temperature relaxations were found to be bulk effect related to localized carriers hopping. It is revealed that the low temperature relaxation is caused by the hopping motion of the self-trapped electrons and the middle temperature relaxation is related to the electrons hopping between Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions.

1013804,"A design method based on modified repetitive control (MRC) for three-phase four-leg inverter was proposed, which can effectively suppress the output voltage disturbances caused by non-linear loads. To make better tradeoff between the performance and robustness of repetitive control, a low-pass filter with zero-phase-shift is added in the compensation unit to increase the freedom of repetitive control. The zero-phase-shift filter is optimized with the target of higher error attenuation rate and less complexity for the filter design. Robust stability for the system is taken into account as the restriction, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to optimize the filter. At last, MRC based on optimal and robust filter with zero-phase-shift was designed. In the proposed controller, error from system modeling is taken into account, so the controller is of great robustness, and it is convenient to be applied in industry.

1013818,"In 2003 and 2004, a total of 100 strains of P. infestans were sampled from Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang province, and their sensitivity to dimethomorph and metalaxyl were determined in vitro. The results showed that there were no significantly difference in sensitivity of strains with different geographical regions in both years to dimethomorph, their sensitivities distributed as a unimodal curve, EC50values ranged from 0. 063 1 μg/mL to 0. 220 6 μg/mL, the most insensitive was 3. 1 folds of the most sensitive, with a mean of (0.115 3±0.030 8) μg/mL, so it can be used as baseline-sensitivity of P. infestans to dimethomorph. The sensitivity to metalaxyl of 64% of isolates decreased, but there was no cross resistance between metalaxyl and dimethomorph. The dimethomorph-resistant mutants of one of three isolates were isolated by treating mycelium with ultraviolet radiation. The mutation frequency was 3% and the resistance factors were 1.5-1.9 folds, no high resistant mutants generated. There was cross resistance between dimethomorph and flumorph, but not with cymoxanil or azoxystrobin. As compared to their original sensitive strain, the hyphal growth rate and sporulation ability of resistant mutants were all decreased significantly, which will likely have an impact on the epidemic development of dimethomorph-resistant population. However, P. infestans was generally thought as a high risk pathogen by FRAC, so the management of risk of resistance should not be neglected, and it suggested that the dimethomorph should be used alternately or in mixture with other not cross-resistant fungicides to avoid or delay the development of resistance.",SK Yuan and XL Liu and Liang Liu and Heng Wang and Hui Jiang and Long-zhi CHEN,14,277239965605405702,Acta Phytopathologica Sinica,,,,Study on baseline sensitivity and laboratory resistant mutants of Phytophthora infestans to dimethomorph,http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-ZWBL200506011.htm,6,2005,/scholar?cites=277239965605405702,siz6KbYAAAAJ:LYDvBi7O6RsC

1013823,"This paper describes the utility of dynamic bifurcation control for suppressing a pathological period-2 rhythm (cardiac alternans) in an atrioventricular modal conduction model. A commonly held view has linked alternans rhythms in this model to period-doubling bifurcations. Our analysis shows that the alternans rhythm is actually associated with a period-1 to period-2 border-collision bifurcation. In the control design, we employ a dynamic feedback control incorporating washout filter to suppress the cardiac alternans. Important features of the dynamic control law include equilibrium preservation even in the presence of model uncertainty, and automatic targeting of the orbits to be controlled. An independent experiment of suppressing cardiac alternans in a piece of dissected rabbit heart demonstrates the viability and utility of the proposed bifurcation control approach.

The purpose of this thesis is to discuss noise content using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and determine a noise model that can best describe the noise process in GPS time series of 20 years or more.  The noise was assumed to be a combination of white noise and power-law noise. In the first part, we used fixed noise models with integer spectral indices for the MLE. The three noise models are: white noise only, white noise plus flicker noise (ƙ  = -1) and white noise plus random walk noise (ƙ  = -2). The estimated MLE values of different noise models were compared to determine the preferred noise model. Another noise parameter, amplitude, was also estimated. Latitude dependence of the noise amplitudes and the influence of data cleaning on the noise analysis were discussed.  In the second part, the noise model was again assumed to be white noise plus power-law noise, but the spectral index of the power-law noise component was not fixed and was also estimated.

1013862,"This study is devoted to a phenomenological and quantitative investigation of␣the physics of spreading of lead-free solder systems (Sn, Sn-0.7Cu, and Sn-3.5Ag) over Cu6Sn5/Cu3Sn/Cu substrates. Wetting kinetics was studied using real-time in situ monitoring of the triple-line kinetics under a controlled atmosphere. Three different intermetallic (IMC) substrates were used for this investigation. It was found that the grain size of the deposited IMC compound coating has a sizable influence on the triple-line movement of the liquid solders considered. More pronounced spreading of solders on IMC substrates was observed for all lead-free solders over an intermetallic with the smallest grain size.

1013864,Nanostructured ZnO network films have been fabricated on Al2O3 substrates by the combination of chemical bath deposition and thermal decomposition process. Layered basic zinc nitrate (LBZN) network films were deposited on the Al2O3 substrates with LBZN crystal seeds in methanol solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine. The LBZN precursor films were then transformed into nanostructured ZnO films by heating at 260 °C in air. During the thermal decomposition process abnormal exothermic heat effect was observed at 200–210 °C and CH3 groups were found in the as-deposited films. We propose that methanol molecules are integrated in the LBZN films forming LBZN–CH3OH complex and that the heat effect comes from the exothermic release of the methanol.,ZJ Yan and DW Zeng and CS Xie and HH Wang and WL Song,13,1891382880162360541,Thin Solid Films,5,1541-1545,Elsevier,Nanostructured ZnO network films deposited on Al2O3 substrates by chemical bath deposition,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040609008010900,517,2009,/scholar?cites=1891382880162360541,siz6KbYAAAAJ:l07DEcJES74C

1013885,"Emphysema is characterized by airway destruction distal to the terminal bronchioles, gradual loss of lung recoil, decreased alveolar surface area, and impaired gas exchange, leading to a reduced FEV1. 1 These last two features, impaired gas exchange and reduction in expiratory flow, are characteristic physiologic abnormalities in patients with emphysema. The most common cause of emphysema is cigarette smoking, although other potential environmental toxins also may contribute. These various insulting agents activate destructive processes in the lung, including the release of active proteases and free radical oxidants in excess of protective mechanisms. The imbalance in protease/antiprotease levels leads to the destruction of the elastin matrix and alveolar structure with progressive loss of lung recoil.

The difference between soil heterotrophic respiration and ecosystem net primary productivity is crucial to determine whether the ecosystem is a carbon source or sink. In this paper, the operations, merits, and drawbacks of the methods used to measure soil heterotrophic respiration, including those of laboratory incubation (incubation with root-removal soil or soil core) and in situ investigation (root-exclusive method, stand girdling method, and isotopic method), were introduced. The dependence of soil heterotrophic respiration to temperature has received considerable interest in studying the carbon cycle and its potential feedbacks to climate change. Temperature, soil moisture, and the availability of soil organic carbon are the major factors affecting the temperature sensitivity of soil heterotrophic respiration (Q10). Under normal condition, the Q10 value decreases with the increase of temperature. When the desiccation stress happens or the soil water content is far above the field capacity, the dependence of soil heterotrophic respiration to temperature will be weakened. The availability of soil organic carbon also affects the sensitivity of soil heterotrophic respiration to temperature change. The Q10 decreases with decreasing availability of soil organic carbon.

Recently, elevated amyloid β (Aβ) in young and aged PLTP-deficient brains had been reported. However, the role of PLTP in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology remains elusive. Here we first found that deficiency of PLTP accelerated memory dysfunction in APP/PS1ΔE9 AD model mice at the age of 3 months. Further characterization showed that PLTP deficiency increased soluble Aβ peptides, and intracellular accumulation of Aβ was illustrated, which might be due to disrupted APP turnover and the enhanced amyloidogenic pathway.

One-dimensional through-plane mass diffusion theory is applied to process the experimental data. It is found that both bulk diffusion coefficient and the effective gas diffusion coefficients of the samples can then be precisely determined, and the measured bulk one is in good agreement with the literature value. Numerical computation of three-dimensional mass diffusion through the samples is performed to calculate the effective gas diffusion coefficients.

1013975,"Through the rock mass deformation mechanism analysis under strain-softening model, the precondition of zonal disintegration was determined, namely, the rock mass deformation reaches the post-peak softening and residual fracture stage. The excavating roadway deformation was analyzed through FLAC numerical simulation whose intact state was described by failure approach index (FAI), the results show that zonal disintegration is closely related to the post-failure character, and it is peculiar to strain-softening model rather than ideal elastic-plastic model; the calculation results depends on mesh precision. When the cell size near the roadway is 1/60 of the roadway radius, surrounding rocks appears spiral zonal cracked region, which leads to zonal disintegration. Whereas traditional annular deformation occurs under coarse mesh precision; zonal disintegration region is highly influenced by the lateral pressure coefficient in plane, the region mainly concentrate on the roadway wall where stress is larger. Zonal disintegration is the interaction result of the secondary stress field in time and space during the roadway excavation.[Fund]: 国家自然科学基金面上资助项目 (50774082 50804046);; 国家重点基础研究发展计划 (973) 资助项目 (2010CB732101);; 岩土力学与工程国家重点实验室前沿探索性资助项目 (SKLQ008)",HY Wang and Qiang Zhang and Yu-jun Zhang and Kai-fa Jiang,11,8673850057155251690,Journal of the China Coal Society,4,535-540,,Numerical simulation on disintegration of surrounding rock mass in deep mine roadways,http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-MTXB201004004.htm,35,2010,/scholar?cites=8673850057155251690,siz6KbYAAAAJ:M8Ejg5y-C14C

The prevailing approach for hydraulic fracture modeling relies on Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM).
