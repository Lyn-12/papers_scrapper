1026000,"Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with different degrees of aggressiveness, variable prognosis and various heterogeneous histologic sub-regions, ie, peritumoral edematous/invaded tissue, necrotic core, active and non-enhancing core. This intrinsic heterogeneity is also portrayed in their radio-phenotype, as their sub-regions are depicted by varying intensity profiles disseminated across multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, reflecting varying biological properties. Their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location are some of the factors that make these tumors difficult to resect, and in some cases inoperable. The amount of resected tumor is a factor also considered in longitudinal scans, when evaluating the apparent tumor for potential diagnosis of progression. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that accurate segmentation of the various tumor sub-regions can offer the basis for quantitative image analysis towards prediction of patient overall survival. This study assesses the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods used for brain tumor image analysis in mpMRI scans, during the last seven instances of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, ie, 2012-2018. Specifically, we focus on i) evaluating segmentations of the various glioma sub-regions in pre-operative mpMRI scans, ii) assessing potential tumor progression by virtue of longitudinal growth of tumor sub-regions, beyond use of the RECIST/RANO criteria, and iii) predicting the overall survival from pre-operative mpMRI scans of patients that underwent gross total resection. Finally, we investigate the challenge …",Spyridon Bakas and Mauricio Reyes and Andras Jakab and Stefan Bauer and Markus Rempfler and Alessandro Crimi and Russell Takeshi Shinohara and Christoph Berger and Sung Min Ha and Martin Rozycki and Marcel Prastawa and Esther Alberts and Jana Lipkova and John Freymann and Justin Kirby and Michel Bilello and Hassan Fathallah-Shaykh and Roland Wiest and Jan Kirschke and Benedikt Wiestler and Rivka Colen and Aikaterini Kotrotsou and Pamela Lamontagne and Daniel Marcus and Mikhail Milchenko and Arash Nazeri and Marc-Andre Weber and Abhishek Mahajan and Ujjwal Baid and Elizabeth Gerstner and Dongjin Kwon and Gagan Acharya and Manu Agarwal and Mahbubul Alam and Alberto Albiol and Antonio Albiol and Francisco J Albiol and Varghese Alex and Nigel Allinson and Pedro HA Amorim and Abhijit Amrutkar and Ganesh Anand and Simon Andermatt and Tal Arbel and Pablo Arbelaez and Aaron Avery and Muneeza Azmat and W Bai and Subhashis Banerjee and Bill Barth and Thomas Batchelder and Kayhan Batmanghelich and Enzo Battistella and Andrew Beers and Mikhail Belyaev and Martin Bendszus and Eze Benson and Jose Bernal and Halandur Nagaraja Bharath and George Biros and Sotirios Bisdas and James Brown and Mariano Cabezas and Shilei Cao and Jorge M Cardoso and Eric N Carver and Adrià Casamitjana and Laura Silvana Castillo and Marcel Catà and Philippe Cattin and Albert Cerigues and Vinicius S Chagas and Siddhartha Chandra and Yi-Ju Chang and Shiyu Chang and Ken Chang and Joseph Chazalon and Shengcong Chen and Wei Chen and Jefferson W Chen and Zhaolin Chen and Kun Cheng and Ahana Roy Choudhury and Roger Chylla and Albert Clérigues and Steven Colleman and Ramiro German Rodriguez Colmeiro and Marc Combalia and Anthony Costa and Xiaomeng Cui and Zhenzhen Dai and Lutao Dai and Laura Alexandra Daza and Eric Deutsch and Changxing Ding and Chao Dong and Shidu Dong and Wojciech Dudzik and Zach Eaton-Rosen,369,7713865873909162489,arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.02629,,,,"Identifying the best machine learning algorithms for brain tumor segmentation, progression assessment, and overall survival prediction in the BRATS challenge",https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02629,,2018,/scholar?cites=7713865873909162489,1UEZWYAAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC
1026001," Precise 3D computerized segmentation of brain tumors remains, until nowadays, a challenging process due to the variety of the possible shapes, locations and image intensities of various tumors types. This paper presents a fully automated and efficient brain tumor segmentation method based on 2D Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DNNs) which automatically extracts the whole tumor and intra-tumor regions, including enhancing tumor, edema and necrosis, from pre-operative multimodal 3D-MRI. The network architecture was inspired by U-net and has been modified to increase brain tumor segmentation performance. Among applied modifications, Weighted Cross Entropy (WCE) and Generalized Dice Loss (GDL) were employed as a loss function to address the class imbalance problem in the brain tumor data. The proposed segmentation system has been tested and evaluated on both, BraTS …",Adel Kermi and Issam Mahmoudi and Khadir Mohamed Tarek,27,1337720317325896633,,,37-48,"A. CRIMI, S. BAKAS, H.

1026002,"This study presents a new fully automated, fast, and accurate brain tumour segmentation method which automatically detects and extracts whole tumours from 3D-MRI. The proposed method is based on a hybrid approach that relies on a brain symmetry analysis method and a combining region-based and boundary-based segmentation methods. The segmentation process consists of three main stages. In the first one, image pre-processing is applied to remove any noise, and to extract the brain from the head image. In the second stage, automated tumour detection is performed. It is based essentially on FBB method using brain symmetry. The obtained result constitutes the automatic initialisation of a deformable model, thus removing the need of selecting the initial region of interest by the user. Finally, the third stage focuses on the application of region growing combined with 3D deformable model based on …",Adel Kermi and Khaled Andjouh and Ferhat Zidane,25,16915837759653672450,IET Image Processing,11,1964 –1971,IET Digital Library,Fully Automated Brain Tumor Segmentation System in 3D-MRI using Symmetry Analysis of Brain and Level-Sets,https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-ipr.2017.1124,12,2018,/scholar?cites=16915837759653672450,1UEZWYAAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC

1026006,"Facial reconstruction from a cranial skeleton is an important technique in several scientific areas, especially in forensic sciences, archaeology, and palaeontology. It is used for skull identification and recognition of people. It can be classified, among reconstructive identification methods. It is most often used as a last resort, when all other techniques fail to produce a person presumed identity. This thesis addresses the facial reconstruction problem from three-dimensional (3D) images of human skulls, considered as unknown. We present a 3D computerized facial reconstruction method based on recent techniques of medical imaging, where the main objectives are the processing speed and the elimination of the subjectivity by leaning particularly on mathematical criteria for evaluating the results. Our method is based on a model deformable approach constrained by the knowledge of soft tissues thicknesses, at a certain number of characteristic landmarks. It uses, for each facial reconstruction, a 3D image of a reference head from which skull and skin are extracted, and a 3D image of the skull of the unknown head for which the skin should be reconstructed. The facial reconstruction process is divided into two main stages. An initialization step of the deformable model, based on a non-linear registration technique guided by B-Spline Free-Form Deformations (FFD) model. We therefore, propose an automatic initialization that is achieved only from a reference skull and skin set as well as an unknown skull. At first, a transformation of the reference skull image into the unknown skull image is computed.

1026008,"La reconstruction faciale à partir d’un squelette crânien apparaît comme un outil de plus en plus important aussi bien en archéologie qu’en sciences forensiques pour l’identification des personnes. Cet article présente une méthode de reconstruction faciale fondée sur des techniques récentes d’imagerie médicale. La reconstruction faciale est obtenue en déformant l’image 3D du crâne de référence vers celle du crâne qualifié d’inconnu. Cette transformation s’ appuie sur un recalage 3D non linéaire guidé par un modèle de déformations de forme libre (FFD) à base de B-splines. Ensuite, la même déformation est appliquée pour transformer la peau de référence vers une nouvelle peau que nous considérons proche de la peau inconnue. Cette méthode a été évaluée à partir de deux ensembles de données crâne/peau correspondant à une tête de référence et à une tête dont la peau est à reconstruire issus d’IRM-3D de têtes d’individus ayant des caractéristiques anthropologiques similaires.Facial reconstruction from a cranial skeleton has emerged as an increasingly important tool in archaeology as well in forensic sciences for identification of people.
