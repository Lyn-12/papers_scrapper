1003005,"Advances in the science and observation of climate change are providing a clearer understanding of the inherent variability of Earth’s climate system and its likely response to human and natural influences. The implications of climate change for the environment and society will depend not only on the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative forcings, but also on how humankind responds through changes in technology, economies, lifestyle and policy. Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options.

The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i.e. from 2.6 to 8.5 W/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100.

1003007,"The Working Group I contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a comprehensive assessment of the physical science basis of climate change. It builds upon the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 and incorporates subsequent new findings from the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation, as well as from research published in the extensive scientific and technical literature. The assessment considers new evidence of past, present and projected future climate change based on many independent scientific analyses from observations of the climate system, paleo-climate archives, theoretical studies of climate processes and simulations using climate models. During the process of scoping and approving the outline of its Fifth Assessment Report, the IPCC focussed on those aspects of the current understanding of the science of climate change that were judged to be most relevant to policy-makers. In this report, Working Group I has extended coverage of future climate change compared to earlier reports by assessing near-term projections and predictability as well as long-term projections and irreversibility in two separate chapters. Following the decisions made by the Panel during the scoping and outline approval, a set of new scenarios, the Representative Concentration Pathways, are used across all three Working Groups for projections of climate change over the 21. century.

1003008,"This paper summarizes the main characteristics of the RCP8.5 scenario. The RCP8.5 combines assumptions about high population and relatively slow income growth with modest rates of technological change and energy intensity improvements, leading in the long term to high energy demand and GHG emissions in absence of climate change policies. Compared to the total set of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP8.5 thus corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Using the IIASA Integrated Assessment Framework and the MESSAGE model for the development of the RCP8.5, we focus in this paper on two important extensions compared to earlier scenarios: 1) the development of spatially explicit air pollution projections, and 2) enhancements in the land-use and land-cover change projections.

1003010,"A sophisticated reader ought to view with great skepticism the prospect of answering questions about the long-term future. The checkered history of predicting the future-from the famous declarations that humans would never fly to the Limits to Growth study to claims about the"" New Economy""-has dissuaded policymakers from considering the effects of their decisions more than a few months or years ahead. However, today's choices will significantly influence the course of the twenty-first century. New analytic methods, enabled by modern computers, may transform our ability to reason systematically about the long term. This report reviews traditional methods of grappling with the morrow, from narratives to scenario analysis, which fail to address the multiplicity of plausible long-term futures. The authors demonstrate a quantitative approach to long-term policy analysis (LTPA). Robust decision methods enable decisionmakers to examine a vast range of plausible futures and design near-term, often adaptive, strategies to be robust across them. Reframing the question"" What will the long-term future bring?"" as"" How can we choose actions today that will be consistent with our long-term interests?"" these methods provide powerful analytic support to humans' innate capacity for"" what-if-ing.""

1003021,"This book presents the findings of the study of the global energy system by the Energy Systems Program, Phase I, of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). The study, which began in the summer of 1973, focused for the first two years on understanding and conceptualizing the energy problem. This led to the design of a set of energy models that were subsequently used for developing two scenarios—the principal tool of our quantitative analysis. A preliminary draft of our findings was completed in 1978 and sent out for review. The widespread substantive comments received on this draft were carefully considered in finalizing our report. This book, which was completed in December 1979, reflects our work up to this date.The purpose of this book is not to advance the state of the art of a particular discipline, although we would be pleased if this were to happen. What we have tried to do is to look at each of the different aspects of the energy problem in a new way—to view them as an integral part of an overall pattern. We therefore suggest that the reader consider this book as a picture or a pattern and not concentrate solely on individual chapters or subjects. This book is divided into parts that cover broad areas of research. In Part I we give some general observations that provide a frame of reference for the whole study. In our discussion of the various global supply options in Part II, and in our treatment of possible constraints on energy strategies in Part III, we have adopted a somewhat visionary approach.

1003022,"10 The main aim of this report is to assess options for mitigating climate change. Several aspects link climate change with development issues. This report explores these links in detail, and makes the connection between climate change mitigation and sustainable development, and demonstrates where the two are mutually reinforcing. Economic development needs, resource endowments and capacities-mitigative and adaptive-differ across regions. There is no one-size fits all approach of the climate change 15 problem and solutions needs to be regionally differentiated, reflecting primarily different socio-economic conditions and to a lesser extent geographical differences. Although this report has a global focus, an attempt is made to differentiate the assessment of scientific and technical findings for the various regions.20 Given that mitigation options vary significantly with economic sectors, it was decided to use the economic sectors to organise the material on short to medium term mitigation options. Contrary to what was done in the Third Assessment Report all relevant aspects of sectoral mitigation options, such as technology, cost, policies, etc are discussed together to provide the user with a comprehensive discussion of the mitigation options. 25",Igor Bashmakov and Leonard Bernstein and JE Bogner and Peter Bosch and Rutu Dave and Ogunlade Davidson and Brian Fisher and Sujata Gupta and Kirsten Halsnaes and Bertjan Heij and Suzana Kahn Ribeiro and Shigeki Kobayashi and Mark Levine and Daniel Martino and Omar Masera Ceruti and Bert Metz and Leo Meyer and Adil Najam Nabuurs and Nebojsa Nakicenovic and Hans Holger Rogner and Joyashree Roy and Jayant Sathaye and Robert Schock and Priyaradshi Shukla and Ralph Sims and Pete Smith and Dennis Tirpak and Diana Urge-Vorsatz,489,15069716797967303289,,,70,Cambridge University Press,Technical summary,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,,2007,/scholar?cites=15069716797967303289,JobRFRAAAAAJ:BJrgspguQaEC

The MA definition of a driver is any natural or human-induced factor that directly or indirectly causes a change in an ecosystem. A direct driver unequivocally influences ecosystem processes. An indirect driver operates more diffusely by altering one or more direct drivers. Global driving forces are categorized as demographic, economic, sociopolitical, cultural and religious, scientific and technological, and physical and biological. Drivers in all categories other than physical and biological are considered indirect. Important direct drivers include changes in climate, plant nutrient use, land conversion, and diseases and invasive species.

1003028,"Climate-change policy-making confronts a wide range of significant scientific and socioeconomic uncertainties. How experts should best characterize such uncertainties for decision-makers has emerged as an important debate within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES)(Nakicenovic et al., 2000) developed 40 scenarios of 21st century anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions for the IPCC’s Third Assessment Report (Houghton et al., 2001). SRES generated the scenarios using six different computer models and a wide range of assumptions about the values of key driving forces. SRES argued that it is not possible to assign a likelihood to any of the emissions scenarios and that the associated uncertainties are best characterized by the full range of scenarios. Recently, some IPCC contributors have initiated a process to guide the Fourth Assessment report toward characterizing uncertainties with probability distributions that represent the consensus of the scientific community (Giles, 2002). Advocates assert that good decisions under uncertainty are contingent on well-defined probabilities and, lacking experts’ judgements, decision-makers will make their own politically motivated estimates of likelihood. Probability-based estimates are a powerful risk-management tool, but can have serious limitations when applied to a problem such as climate change. To avoid the pitfalls of probability-based methods, the IPCC should also consider approaches to decision-making under conditions of uncertainty that do not depend on expert consensus on probabilities.",Robert Lempert and Nebojsa Nakicenovic and Daniel Sarewitz and Michael Schlesinger,303,17213514098771526493,Climatic Change,1-2,1-9,,Characterizing climate-change uncertainties for decision-makers,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Lempert/publication/226368172_Characterizing_Climate-Change_Uncertainties_for_Decision-Makers_An_Editorial_Essay/links/00b7d52b09db6d293e000000.pdf,65,2004,/scholar?cites=17213514098771526493,JobRFRAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC

Rural populations globally are expected to peak at a level of 3.5 billion people by around 2020 and decline thereafter, albeit with heterogeneous regional trends.

Growth in these smaller cities poses serious policy challenges, especially in the developing world. In small cities, data and information to guide policy are largely absent, local resources to tackle development challenges are limited, and governance and institutional capacities are weak, requiring serious efforts in capacity building, novel applications of remote sensing, information, and decision support techniques, and new institutional partnerships.

Scenarios are one of the main tools for assessment of future developments in complex systems that often are inherently unpredictable, are insuff iciently understood, and have high scientific uncertainties. The central goals of the chapter are to set out the different approaches to scenario use, to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, and to highlight key issues relating to scenario application that should be considered in conducting future assessments.Recognizing the central role of scenarios in impact and ada ptation studies, scenarios are treated separately for the first time by Working Group II. 1 This chapter builds on Chapter 13 of the WGI contribution to the Third Assessment Report (TAR), which describes construction of climate scenarios, by embracing scenarios that portray future developments of any factor (climatic or otherwise) that might have a bearing on cl imate change vulnerability, impacts, and adaptive capacity. A distinction is drawn between climate scenarios, which describe the forcing factor of key interest in this report, and nonclimatic scenarios (eg, of projected socioeconomic, technological, land-use, and other environmental changes), which provide the “context”—a description of a future world on which the climate operates. Many early impact assessments tended to focus on climate forcing without properly considering the context, even though this might have an important or even dominant role in determining future vulnerability to climate.",Timothy R Carter and EMILIO L La Rovere and RN Jones and R Leemans and LO Mearns and N Nakicenovic and AB Pittock and SM Semenov and J Skea,169,5650430581595924382,Climate change,,145-190,,Developing and applying scenarios,https://www-iam.nies.go.jp/aim/india0210/cc_papers/ipccreports/climate_change_2001/working_group2/WG2_03.pdf,200,2001,/scholar?cites=5650430581595924382,JobRFRAAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C

1003042,"Much is written in the popular literature about the current pace of technological change. But do we have enough scientific knowledge about the sources and management of innovation to properly inform policymaking in technology dependent domains such as energy and the environment? While it is agreed that technological change does not'fall from heaven like autumn leaves,'the theory, data, and models are deficient. The specific mechanisms that govern the rate and direction of inventive activity, the drivers and scope for incremental improvements that occur during technology diffusion, and the spillover effects that cross-fertilize technological innovations remain poorly understood. In a work that will interest serious readers of history, policy, and economics, the editors and their distinguished contributors offer a unique, single volume overview of the theoretical and empirical work on technological change. Beginning with a survey of existing research, they provide analysis and case studies in contexts such as medicine, agriculture, and power generation, paying particular attention to what technological change means for efficiency, productivity, and reduced environmental impacts. The book includes a historical analysis of technological change, an examination of the overall direction of technological change, and general theories about the sources of change. The contributors empirically test hypotheses of induced innovation and theories of institutional innovation. They propose ways to model induced technological change and evaluate its impact, and they consider issues such as uncertainty in technology returns, technology crossover effects, and …",Arnulf Grübler,156,17017348554495970158,,,,Routledge,Technological change and the environment,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=8ieyxMJK6UIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR1&dq=info:bku9OVnEKewJ:scholar.google.com&ots=thD0WWnW7J&sig=bdwvZ1-FrpJhUcqUh8JdcTT_DJw,,2010,/scholar?cites=17017348554495970158,JobRFRAAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC

The scenarios are based on an extensive assessment of the literature and shared assumptions about the main driving forces of future emissions. They were developed in collaboration with many groups and individuals over the last 3 years. The scenarios are rooted in four narrative “stories” about future worlds that describe alternative developments relevant for emissions and their driving forces. Each scenario is a quantitative interpretation of one of four future worlds developed by one of the five models. Together, the scenarios cover a wide range of the main driving forces of future emissions from demographic to social and economic developments.

And although emissions were recently near the top of the range that has been covered6, the changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration follow long-term average emissions rather than short-term variations. The greenhouse gas emission scenarios used in recent IPCC assessments originated from the IPCC’s Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) 7.This provided a detailed overview of forty non-mitigation scenarios that were structured into six subgroups based on common storylines.

With advances in technology it is possible to provide entirely new services and to achieve more with less input. This implies that in addition to productivity increases, the efficiency in the use of energy, basic materials, capital, and other inputs will improve, alleviating many adverse impacts and improving environmental compatibility. Efficient use of time is another important factor, especially in the context of the longterm development of transport systems. Great leaps in the advancement of transport systems have allowed ever greater distances to be covered in a unit of time, from the traditional villages and preindustrial cities connected by walking, to almost the whole world being connected in one day by aircraft. Technological improvements are achieved both through the introduction of fundamentally new solutions (basic innovations), and through incremental improvements in existing techniques and systems (product and process innovations). Although an overlap exists, it is important to distinguish between the two because it is the basic innovations as originally formulated by Schumpeter that will lead to the creation of entirely new industries and growth sectors. Innovations provide for economic growth only by their widespread application throughout the economy, ie, via their diffusion. During the diffusion process, there is a gradual transition from basic innovations that initially leads to the creation of new industries, to incremental improvements, and product innovations as the diffusion process matures.

Technologies that are more energy efficient have replaced less efficient ones, and technologies that are less carbon intensive have replaced those that are more carbon intensive. Technological change has made a major contribution to these long-term iinprovements in the productivity of energy. In particular, the decarbonization of energy-namely, the reduction of the specific carbon content of energy-can be interpreted as a long-term learning process that can be represented by a learning curve. In this paper it is argued that the dynamics of technological cha. nge is a cumulative process of learning by doing.

1003084,"Technological change is a complex process that is associated with many uncertainties. Its future course is inherently unpredictable. The very fact that it is virtually impossible to anticipate specific future technological change is what interests many researchers and innovators. Discovering new possibilities and demonstrating unanticipated possibilities is often what attracts their curiosity. Thus, the risk and opportunity are joint features of technological change rendering the process inherently unpredictable. This is an important reason why studies about future technologies need to consider a range of alternative developments rather than attempting to project a particular direction of change. They need to capture a wide spectrum of developments in order to assess the implications and possibilities of different alternatives. Here we do so on the basis of energy scenarios that contain assumptions about many different technologies, their costs and performance.A number of economic studies have determined that up to half historical productivity growth is due to technological change and the other half due to all other reasons such as the growth of the labor force, labor productivity, capital stock, etc. The same is true for technological change in scenarios about possible future energy developments. Technological change may be more important in determining the structure of future energy systems and services than some other major driving forces such as population growth and economic development (Nakicenovic et al., 2000a).

There is little research exploring how quality could be equated to transformation in the learning process.

Using data from interviews with 32 PhD supervisors and students in two English universities and the outcomes of a collage-making workshop, this paper will reveal how student transformation was perceived as relating to quality learning.

We will argue that the long-wave phenomenon is one particular way of describing technological, economic, and social change and development. We show that this evolutionary development process is the result of a sequence of replacements of one technique (technology, artifact, product, practice, organization, tradition, or idea) by another.Long waves emerge because a number of important replacements take place simultaneously, leading to a prolonged phase of economic growth.

Two important areas of agreement have emerged from the debate according to our view.First, both parties agree that scenarios assuming a conditional convergence in income levels, i.e., a higher growth in per capita income in poorer countries when compared to countries with higher levels of affluence, are both “plausible and well attested in economic history” (C&H, p. 424).

The process, therefore, appears much more focused internationally toward the saturation phase. However, this visible catch-up effect refers only to the relative diffusion rates and not to the absolute level of adoption.

The Parametric Framework (in Lotus format) contains a data set comprising 13 world regions/countries, socio-economic background data, and three different types of greenhouse gases/sources: fossil fuel and industrial carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, CO2 emissions from biota and land-use changes, and anthropogenic methane (CH4) emissions. Historical emission data span the period 1800 to 1988 for CO2, and 1950 to 1988 for CH4.

1003109,"Although the general phenomena of technology life–cycle have been known for a long time, quantitative description is still controversial. In the majority of cases, an S–curve fits the phenomena well. There are cases, however, that deviate from S–curves significantly.

1003112,"Numerous factors, sometimes called driving forces, influence future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Both future emissions and the evolution of their underlying driving forces (eg, rate of technology changes, prices) are highly uncertain. This is the reason scenarios are used to describe how the future may develop, based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key relationships, driving forces, and the emissions outcomes. The emissions scenarios in the literature encompass a wide range of different future developments that might influence GHG sources and sinks, such as alternative structures of energy systems and land use changes (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). Clearly, demographic and economic developments play a crucial role in determining emissions. Another driving force, at least as important, is technological change. Other factors are diverse, and it is not possible to devise a simple scheme that accounts for all the factors considered and included in the scenarios. They range from human resources such as education, institutional frameworks, and lifestyles to natural resource endowments, capital vintage structures, and international trade patterns. For this chapter, I choose a simple scheme captured by the so-called Kaya identity. This hypothetical identity represents the main emissions driving forces as multiplicative factors (Yamaji et al. 1991):",Nebojsa Nakicenovic,35,9309696115491815265,"The global carbon cycle: integrating humans, climate, and the natural world",,225,Island Press,Socioeconomic driving forces of emissions scenarios,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qcjuz5SWj9wC&oi=fnd&pg=PA225&dq=info:YT-5ykqvMoEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=uDjsnWiJb9&sig=EBCVuH77SGN2gadH8c_SOr9hJ1I,62,2004,/scholar?cites=9309696115491815265,JobRFRAAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC

1003121,"Energy scenarios provide a framework for exploring future energy perspectives, including various combinations of technology options and their implications. Many scenarios in the literature illustrate how energy system developments will affect the global issues analysed in part 1 (chapters 1–4). Some describe energy futures that are compatible with sustainable development goals, such as improved energy efficiencies and the adoption of advanced energy supply technologies. Sustainable development scenarios are also characterised by low environmental impacts (local, regional, global) and equitable allocation of resources and wealth. The three cases of alternative global developments presented in this chapter suggest how the future could unfold in terms of economic growth, population trends, and energy use. The challenge is formidable. For example, by 2100, 6–8 billion additional people—significantly more than the world population today—will need access to affordable, reliable, flexible, and convenient energy services. All three cases achieve this, through different energy system developments, but with varying degrees of sustainability.A middle-course reference case (B) includes one scenario and is based on the direction in which the world is headed. Assuming continued moderate economic growth and modest technological improvement, this scenario leads to adverse environmental impacts, ranging from regional acidification to climate change.

However, their conclusion—that known technological options are not up to the task—suffers from two shortcomings related to how much decarbonization is required and how soon we need it. First, they do not consider uncertainty in future energy demand, basing their analysis on a single reference scenario (1). In contrast, the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on emissions scenarios (2) foresees a wide range of plausible development paths leading to global primary power demand of anywhere from 20 to 50 TW by 2050. Relative to these scenarios, as quantified by six different integrated assessment modeling teams, stabilizing at 550 ppm may not require any additional energy from carbon-free technologies over the next 50 years beyond that produced by known technologies for reasons unrelated to climate change. Or it could require that additional zero-carbon generating capacity deliver nearly 600 TW-years of energy over that same period. Policy responses to climate change should be robust across this wide range of uncertainty. Second, we doubt whether the development and implementation of the radically new technologies such as fusion or solar power satellites advocated in the article are feasible within the time horizon necessary for CO2 stabilization.

1003130,"The paper presents estimates of the global energy efficiency improvement potential by applying first- and second-law, or exergy, analysis to regional and global energy balances. The investigation is based on the uniform analysis of national and regional energy balances and the aggregation of these balances into the main regions and subsequently into world totals. The procedure involves the assessment of exergy efficiencies at each step of energy conversion, from primary to final and useful exergy. Ideally, the analysis should be extended to actual energy services delivered. Unfortunately, data are scarce and only rough estimates can be given for the last stage of the energy chain. The overall result is that current global useful exergy efficiency is about one-tenth of the theoretical maximum and service efficiency is only a few percent. Whereas conventional energy analysis grossly overestimates the prevailing conversion efficiencies, exergy analysis provides a more appropriate yardstick.   Energy efficiency improvements are considered one of the most effective means of decreasing global energy requirements and related adverse environmental impacts without reducing the quality of energy services delivered. Historical analysis for the energy systems shows continuous efficiency improvements of energy chains of about 1% per year, measured by energy intensity, due to technological, structural, and social changes; it also allows some prospectives into the future. Efficiency improvements of energy supply are mostly technology-driven, whereas improvements in energy use depend more on lifestyles.",Paul Viktor Gilli and Nebojsa Nakicenovic and Rainer Kurz,22,9573347279047392585,More Efficient Use of Energy,,,"RR-96-002.

1003134,"World leaders have pledged to act to change the future shape of the global energy economy. Since the 2006 edition of the WEO, some new policies have been put in place to that effect. Yet in the Reference Scenario in this year’s WEO, which takes these new policies into account, projected global energy demand in 2030 is higher than before and the supply and emissions trends are worsening. What is going on?  One key answer is sustained high levels of economic growth in the new giants of the world economy. China and India together account for nearly half of the entire growth in world energy demand between 2005 and 2030. China is likely to have overtaken the United States to become the world’s largest emitter of energy-related carbon dioxide this year and, by 2015, India will be the thirdlargest emitter. By around 2010, China will overtake the United States to become the world’s largest consumer of energy. In 2030, India will be the thirdlargest oil importer in the world. Over the period to 2030, China will install more new electricity generating capacity than exists in the United States today. China and India need to sustain a phenomenal rate of economic growth. There are still over 400 million people in India without access to electricity.

1003135,"With substantial increases in the global demand for energy services expected over the next century, energy technology holds the key to effective limitation of greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon-based fuels and their associated technologies supplied 88 percent of the world’s energy in 1995. Over the coming decades, technologies that provide energy services but emit little or no CO2 into the atmosphere will compete in the global marketplace with ever-improving carbon-emitting fossil-fuel technologies. How successfully they compete will determine future emissions. Figure 4.1 illustrates the nature of the challenge. The middle curve depicts the carbon dioxide emissions associated with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) central scenario, denoted IS92a. This IPCC reference case scenario is based on analysis of trends in global population, economic growth, land use, and energy systems. The underlying energy and land use changes produce carbon emissions that grow steadily throughout the century from 7 petagrams of carbon (PgC) per year in 1990 to almost 20 PgC per year in 2100.",Jae Edmonds and Fortunat Joos and Nebojsa Nakicenovic and Richard G Richels and Jorge L Sarmiento,21,6080184033749784230,,,77-102,Island Press,"Scenarios, targets, gaps and costs",http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qcjuz5SWj9wC&oi=fnd&pg=PA77&dq=info:plaoHConYVQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=uDjsnWjA65&sig=X0kyVgxfBJIShzhMmGbWCb1G21M,,2004,/scholar?cites=6080184033749784230,JobRFRAAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC

1003137,"The objective of this paper is to assess, on the basis of a number of indicative examples, the time needed to build new and replace old transportation and energy systems, and their infrastructures. Most of the examples are taken from the United States, since the United States has been one of the few countries to experience most of the technological changes that occurred during the last 200 years. However, because most of these technological changes were subsequently disseminated throughout the world, the examples also indicate the dynamics of these processes elsewhere.   Within the scope of this paper, the use of the term infrastructure is rather narrow, referring only to transportation and energy grids and networks, and other components of these two systems. These two systems are interesting because they played a crucial role in the economic and technological development process, are very capital intensive and, in general, have long lifetimes. The analysis of the historical development of these two systems will include a quantitative description of performance improvement, the general evolution of a particular infrastructure, and the replacement of old by new technologies and infrastructures in terms of their relative market shares. We use the term performance as a multidimensional concept (i.e., as a vector rather than a scalar indicator) and, where appropriate, measure the size of an infrastructure as a function of time.

The examples, reconstructed from historical records, describe the quantitative, technological changes in energy consumption, steel production and merchant marine in the United States.   Logistic substitution analysis is used to capture the dynamics and regularity of these technological changes. It is shown that technological substitution analysis describes fundamental structural changes that lead to new economic patterns and forms. The emerging patterns of technological and economic changes during the last two to three centuries are shown to portray periodic recurrences at intervals of about half a century. In this sense. the technological substitution processes are related to the long swings in economic development because they identify and describe major and periodic fluctuations in the historical rate of technological change and accordingly also the secular changes in the rate of economic growth.

1003152,"Stabilizing climate at temperatures below 2◦ C will require rapid and sustained emission reductions and near-zero or negative emissions before the end of the century (eg Clarke et al 2014, UNFCCC 2015). During the past decade, however, emissions from fossil fuel use and cement production have remained high. Emissions in recent years have been fairly stable at∼ 10 Pg C yr− 1 but are still 60% greater than in 1990 (Le Quéré et al 2016, Jackson et al 2016). Climate stabilization temperature depends on the cumulative emissions since the beginning of the fossil era some two centuries ago. As a way to reconcile current emission trends with the small carbon budgets compatible with 1.5◦ C and 2◦ C average increases in global temperature, one option invoked in integrated assessment models (IAMs) and, increasingly, in policy circles is negative emissions (NEs)(eg Royal Society 2009, Tavoni and Socolow 2013, McLaren 2013, NRC 2015, Smith et al 2016). A NE technology results in the net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere (also sometimes referred to as carbon dioxide removal, CDR). Examples of the most commonly proposed negative emission technologies (NETs) include biomass energy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS), afforestation, and industrial direct air capture (DAC).Current 1.5◦ C scenarios all feature rapid deployment of NETs, and most scenarios limiting global warming to 2◦ C rely on NETs, as well (Rogelj et al 2015).

1003164,"Over the past decade, Australia has benefited greatly from its natural resource endowments. The sustained mining boom has contributed significantly to economic growth, investment, employment, as well as taxation and royalty payments to governments, and continues to do so. While some parts of the manufacturing sector have suffered from the appreciation of the Australian dollar, Australia’s services sector has played a key role in supporting the growth of the mining sector and has profited accordingly. On recent Reserve Bank of Australia estimates, around half of the cost of new mining investment was spent locally on labour and other inputs. In addition, Australian residents received more than half of the earnings from the mining sector. Moreover, while mining operations are concentrated in the resource-rich states, the distribution of mining receipts has been dispersed across the country and has played a key role in keeping unemployment rates low in all states since the onset of the resources boom.In the future, the consensus is that the strength in demand for raw materials will be sustained as developing countries industrialise and lift the living standards of their populations. Rising demand and recent higher prices have accordingly fuelled a global exploration and development effort that will result in mining activities expanding in both traditional and emerging minerals producing countries.",Brian S Fisher and Sabine Schnittger,12,5418198849336506179,"BAeconomics Pty Ltd, February",,,,Autonomous and remote operation technologies in the mining industry,https://www.baeconomics.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Mining-innovation-5Feb12.pdf,,2012,/scholar?cites=5418198849336506179,JobRFRAAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC

1003170,"This paper compares technological development paths that determine future mitigation scenarios aimed at stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Future social and economic development paths have already been compared in relation to their impact on climate mitigation by Morita, Nakicenovic and Robinson (2000). This paper is an expansion of that earlier comparison. Forty stabilization scenarios are reviewed, and all use as their baseline the new scenarios by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published in the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (Nakicenovic et al, 2000).  Several common tendencies and characteristics can be observed across the scenarios. First, the different technological development paths described in the baseline IPCC scenarios require                 that: CO2 emissions be reduced by different levels; different schedules for the reductions be adopted; and, different technology/policy measures be chosen to stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentrations - even to achieve the same stabilization level. Second, no one single measure is sufficient for the development, adoption and diffusion of mitigation options to achieve stabilization within the accepted time-frame. Third, the level of technology/policy measures needed to achieve stabilization toward the end of the 21st century or beginning of the 22nd century will be greatly affected by the choice of technological development paths over next decades. The paper also identifies some characteristics in technological measures across the different technological development paths to achieve the stabilization targets.",Tsuneyuki Morita and Nebosja Nakicenovic and John Robinson,11,2296175823062582880,,,,Center for Global Environmental Research.

Natural gas could be the bridge to carbon-free energy sources such as hydrogen (Nakićenović, 1993a).Global primary energy use has evolved from reliance on traditional energy sources to fossil fuel based first on coal and steam, then on oil and natural gas, and more recently,(but to a lesser extent) on nuclear and hydro energy.

1003175,"This chapter examines the theme of transitions in energy systems. It assesses the literature that explores the genesis, growth, and management of transitions. This literature provides a multi-level framework for large-scale, transformative change in technology systems, involving a hierarchy of changes from experiments to niches to technology regimes. The chapter also covers specific innovation systems and experiments in the energy sector that may have the potential for larger impact and could lead to new niches or technology regimes. These experiments include technology-driven innovations in generation and end-use; system-level innovations that could reconfigure existing systems; and business model innovations centered on energy service delivery. Experiments in generation include hybrid systems, where multiple primary energy sources help address issues such as intermittency. Experiments in end-use include technology options for the simultaneous delivery of multiple energy services, or energy and non-energy services. System-level experiments include innovations in storage, distributed generation, and the facilitation of energy efficiency by effectively monetizing savings in energy use. In some of these experiments, technology can lead to changing relationships between actors or changing roles for actors; for example, the process of consumers becoming producers is seen in small-scale biogas projects. These changing relationships present both challenges and opportunities for influencing the transition process. The chapter also discusses policy and institutional issues that affect transitions.

1003176,"The three most basic drivers of energy demand are economic activity, population, and technology. Longer-term trends in economic growth for a particular economy depend on underlying demographic and productivity trends, which in turn reflect population growth, labor force participation rate, productivity growth, national savings rate, and capital accumulation (USEIA, 2011). Several historic shifts are likely to fundamentally alter global demographics over the coming decades. First, as developing nations move from poverty to relative affluence, there is a fundamental shift from agriculture to more energy-intensive but much more productive commercial enterprises. Second, labor forces in the developed countries are aging considerably, which has implications on many fronts, including energy use and employment structures. Third, for the first time the majority of the world's population has become urbanized, with the largest urban centers emerging in developing regions where energy access is a serious constraint. All of these will have immense impacts on the level and quality of energy demand and on concerns about energy security. Global energy security and sustainability in the twenty-first century will depend less on the total global population than on incomes and their distribution. This in turn will depend to a large extent on how effectively the lack of energy services, which now limit economic opportunities in the less developed regions, is addressed.

1003177,"In this paper, we propose a scenario framework that could provide a scenario “thread” through the different climate research communities (climate change–vulnerability, impact, and adaptation (VIA) and mitigation) in order to provide assessment of mitigation and adaptation strategies and other VIA challenges. The scenario framework is defined across two main axes. One is defined by the radiative forcing levels (climate signal) of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The second axis is defined by socio-economic development–and comprises elements that affect the capacity for adaptation and mitigation but also exposure to climate impacts. The proposed set of scenarios derived from this framework are limited in number, allow for comparison across various mitigation and adaptation levels, address a range of vulnerability characteristics, provide information across climate forcing and vulnerability states and spans a full century time scale. Scenario assessment based on the proposed framework would strengthen cooperation between integrated-assessment modelers, climate modelers and the VIA research community, and most importantly, facilitate the development of more consistent and comparable research within and across communities.",Detlef van Vuuren and Keywan Riahi and Richard Moss and Jae Edmonds and Allison Thomson and Nebosja Nakicenovic and Tom Kram and Frans Berkhout and Rob Swart and Anthony Janetos and Steve Rose and Nigel Arnell,10,9752760130749753602,Global Environmental Change.

As an intermediary step towards the final, long-term research objective of developing a multi-agent model, this paper deals with two heterogeneous agents, a risk-taking one and a risk-aversion one. Interactions between the two agents include trade on resource and good, and technological spillover (""free-riding"" and technology trade). With the two heterogeneous agents, we run optimization to minimize their aggregated costs to find out what rational behaviors are under different assumptions if the two agents are somehow cooperative. The global optimal solutions of the two-agent model are of Pareto optimality in the sense that none of the two could be made better off without the other being made worse off. The simulations show how agent heterogeneity -  different risk attitudes and sizes, trade between agents and technological spillover effect influence the technological change process.

1003183,"The current human-dominated era or ""Anthropocene"" has been a time of unprecedented rates of change within the Earth system. As such the Anthropocene poses a no-analogue situation in which evidence of past Earth system change cannot, on their own, tell us of how the system will respond in the future. Instead, we need to develop mechanistic and phenomenological models based on robust underlying principles to extrapolate our knowledge of the past Earth system into projections of the future. This requires an entire spectrum of Earth system models that can be related to each other in a more rigorous way that has been achieved to date. It also requires new integrated models of the two-way coupling between the biophysical and human aspects of the Earth system. Only then will we be able to approach all of the paleodata constraints on the Earth system dynamics (which require long simulations), while also providing regionally specific Earth system projections and spatially specific human development paths for policy makers (which requires, in both cases, high-resolution comprehensive models as well as models that can bridge spatial and temporal scales).

1003192,"In collaboration with the World Energy Council (WEC), IIASA conducted a five-year study of long-term global and regional energy perspectives. Using IIASA's integrated modeling framework, the study explores a broad range of energy developments and their consequences, such as the likely financing needs and environmental impacts. This paper summarizes the main features and findings of the study focusing on implications of global perspectives for Euroasian regions.   One of the important results of the study is the need for further energy integration in Eurasia to achieve both goals of supplying the energy services needed for economic development and reducing the adverse impacts on the environment at all scales. Clean fossil fuels would continue to be an important sources of these energy services and would lead to further decarbonization of energy. This, however, requires the emergence of large interconnected energy grids in Eurasia and implies a drastic energy geo-political shift. Such developments could dramatically improve the match between demand and supply for hydrocarbons (oil and gas) and in the long-term promote even further integration of Europe and Asia. e.g., through gas and electricity networks.   Such ambitious Eurasian energy grids would bring large economic benefits to gas (and energy) exporting regions and would enable healthier economic development throughout the region by the provision of cleaner and more flexible energy forms to most of the citizens. Financing would be a challenging problem but only probably during the initial phases of the long-term construction of Eurasian energy grids.

1003193,"The paper reports on a study on Global Energy Perspectives to 2050 and Beyond conducted jointly by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and the World Energy Council (WEC). All together three cases of economic and energy developments were developed that sprawl into six scenarios of energy supply alternatives extending until the end of the 21st century. The internal consistency of the scenarios was assessed with the help of formal energy models. The study took close account of world population prospects, economic growth, technological advance, the energy resource base, environmental implications from the local to the global level, financing requirements, and the future prospects of both fossil and non-fossil fuels and industries. Although no analysis can turn an uncertain future into a sure thing, the study identifies patterns that are robust across a purposely broad range of scenarios. The study also enables to relate alternative near term research and development, technology, economic, and environmental policies to the possible long-term divergence of energy systems structures. Due to the long lead times involved in the turnover of capital stock and infrastructures of the energy system, policies would need to be implemented now in order to initiate long-term structural changes in the energy system that would however become significant only after the year 2020.",A Grubler and M Jefferson and N Nakicenovic,8,3902337617554724703,,,,WP-95-102,A summary of the joint IIASA and WEC study on long-term energy perspectives,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/4494/,,1995,/scholar?cites=3902337617554724703,JobRFRAAAAAJ:w0F2JDEymm0C

1003201,"As incomes increase around the world, people will demand more efficient, cleaner, and less obtrusive energy services. That is the central message of the three cases, subdivided into six scenarios, that are presented in the full report of the joint IIASA and WEC study Global Energy Perspectives to 2050 and Beyond (1). The scenarios cover a wide range of global energy developments-from a tremendczs expansion of coal production to strict limits, from a phaseaut of nuclear energy to a substantial increase, from carbon emissions in 2 100 that are only onethird of today's levels to increases by more than a factor of three. Yet, for all the variation they explore among alternative energy systems, all manage to match the likely, continuing push by consumers for more flexible, more convenient, cleaner forms of energy. This report summarizes the financing requirements of the energy sector needed to achieve these goals, with a particular emphasis on investments in the developing regions.Capital requirements are assessed according to traditional definitions of energy investments. They include capital for energy production capacities, for conversion and transformation facilities, for transmission and distribution infrastructures, and for complying with environmental standards. Capital requirements for energy end-use devices are not included in this assessment.(Traditionally they are excluded from energy-sector capital requirements and are counted as durable consumer goods and business investments.) The range of the cumulative capital requirements from 1990 to 2020, across the cases, is measured from US (1990) $13 to 20 trillion (10'~).

1003212,"Since the first measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were taken in 1958 on Mauna Loa, annual averages have portrayed a steady increase from about 315 to more than 350 ppm today. It is believed that the pre-industrial carbon dioxide concentration levels were about 280 ppm. Probably most of this increase is due to anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide such as fossil energy use and deforestation. The emissions of other greenhouse gases are also increasing but global warming is foremost a carbon dioxide problem. It accounts for about 50 percent of the anthropogenic sources of global warming. The next largest share is due to methane with about 20 percent. The relative contributions of different sources of carbon dioxide emissions are illustrated in Figure 1. It clearly demonstrates that fossil energy consumption contributes about a half of all anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide. The largest single source of carbon emissions from fossil fuels is coal (about 60 percent of all fossil-fuel emissions), followed by oil (around 30 percent) and gas (less than 10 percent).Most of the carbon dioxide increase is due to the historical emissions in the now industrialized countries of the"" Northn. With only 25 percent of world population, these countries currently account for two-thirds of the global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.

1003215,"Since 2007, the perceptions of the international community all over the world about the dangers of climate change and about the need for vigorous response strategies have changed dramatically. This change was triggered by the release of the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) Climate Change 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and by the ongoing scientific progress in the field of global climate change. The scientific consensus reported in the AR4 received an unprecedented echo in the media and subsequently raised the public awareness concerning global climate change and its adverse impacts to an extent never seen before. As a result, the report encouraged numerous initiatives to combat global climate change–most notably the European Union’s decision to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% by 2020 (compared to the amount of GHGs emitted in 1990). In addition, more than 100 countries followed the European example and adopted a global warming limit of 2 C or below (relative to preindustrial levels) as a long-term climate protection goal.In order to assess the opportunity to stabilize carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations at a level that is compatible with the EU climate protection goal, the following issues need to be addressed. Which temperature changes are to be expected in the business-as-usual case, in other words, if no specific measures directed at mitigating climate change are implemented? Is there thus a real necessity to change course? If there is a real necessity, could cheap energy efficiency improvements solve the problem?

1003217,"Are world oil and gas supplies under threat? How could a new international accord on stabilising greenhouse-gas emissions affect global energy markets? World Energy Outlook 2008 answers these and other burning questions.    WEO-2008 draws on the experience of another turbulent year in energy markets to provide new energy projections to 2030, region by region and fuel by fuel. It incorporates the latest data and policies.    WEO-2008 focuses on two pressing issues facing the energy sector today:    (1) Prospects for oil and gas production: How much oil and gas exists and how much can be produced? Will investment be adequate? Through field-by-field analysis of production trends at 800 of the world's largest oilfields, an assessment of the potential for finding and developing new reserves and a bottom-up analysis of upstream costs and investment, WEO-2008 takes a hard look at future global oil and gas supply.    (2) Post-2012 climate scenarios: What emissions limits might emerge from current international negotiations on climate change? What role could cap-and-trade and sectoral approaches play in moving to a low-carbon energy future? Two different scenarios are assessed, one in which the atmospheric concentration of emissions is stabilised at 550 parts per million (ppm) in CO2 equivalent terms and the second at the still more ambitious level of 450ppm. The implications for energy demand, prices, investment, air pollution and energy security are fully spelt out.

The interdisciplinary research effort within GGI links all major research programs of IIASA dealing with climate change related research areas including population, energy, technology, forestry, as well as land-use changes and agriculture. GGI's research includes both basic as well as applied, policy-relevant research, aiming to assess conditions, uncertainties, impacts as well as policy frameworks for addressing climate stabilization both from a near-term as well as long-term perspective.   We first describe the motivation behind this scenario exercise and introduce the main scenario features and characteristics in both qualitative as well as quantitative terms. Altogether we analyze three ""baseline"" scenarios of different socio-economic and technological developments which are assumed not to include any explicit climate policies. We then impose a range of climate stabilization targets on these baseline scenarios and analyze in detail feasibility, costs and uncertainties of meeting a range of different climate stabilization targets in accordance with the Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992). The scenarios were developed by the IIASA Integrated Assessment Modeling Framework that encompasses detailed representations of the principal greenhouse gas emitting (GHG) sectors / energy, industry, agriculture, and forestry.

1003219,"The basic motivation for undertaking the development of alternative storylines about future diffusion of new energy infrastructures is the need for a transition of the global energy system toward (1) provision of affordable and reliable energy services for most of the global population and (2) protection of the environment at all scales from global to local. Another salient energy challenge that needs to be considered in this context is the issue of supply security. A complete paradigm change is required for this transition to take place. An important dimension of this change is the development and widespread deployment of hydrogen and electricity systems toward zero-emissions energy systems. Such a transition toward a hydrogen and electricity (hydricity) age is consistent with the historical evolution of global energy system.It is consistent with a pervasive decarbonization of energy end use from exclusive dependence on carbon-intensive energy carriers such as direct use of coal and biomass toward liquid energy carriers, electricity and energy gases. These developments of energy end use also reflect similar changes in the nature of energy supply. Primary energy structure has decarbonized as well, from reliance on traditional energy sources and coal toward ever-larger shares of oil, gas, nuclear and modern renewables.",Nebojsa Nakicenovic and Osamu Kimura and Amela Ajanovic,5,1920434322599819323,,,,IR-05-028,Global hydrogen and electricity storylines,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/7807/1/IR-05-028.pdf,,2005,/scholar?cites=1920434322599819323,JobRFRAAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC

Models that assess the costs of climate change mitigation policy rely heavily on learning curves to incorporate changes in technology. Historically, no energy technology has changed more dramatically than photovoltaics (PV), the cost of which has declined by a factor of nearly 100 since the 1950s. Which changes were more important in accounting for the cost reductions that have occurred over the past three decades? Are these results consistent with the widely held learning-by-doing theory of technological change? We gather empirical data and populate a simple model to identify the most important factors affecting the cost of PV.

1003238,"The World Energy Council’s recent study examined the potential of energy end-use technologies and of research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) into these technologies on a global scale. Surprises are likely, but nevertheless, current research and development offer a picture of what might happen in the future as new technologies face the competition of the marketplace. Given the breadth of energy end-use technologies and the differences between regions and economic conditions, the study focused on technologies that appear most important from today’s vantage point. Globally, robust research and development followed by demonstrations of new end-use technologies can potentially save at least 110 EJ/year by 2020 and over 300 EJ/year by 2050. If achieved, this translates to worldwide energy savings of as much as 25% by 2020 and over 40% by 2050, over what may be required without these technologies. It is almost certain that no single technology, or even a small set of technologies, will dominate in meeting the needs of the globe in any foreseeable timeframe.  Absent a significant joint government–industry effort on end-use technology RD&D, the technologies needed will not be ready for the marketplace in the timeframes required with even the most pessimistic scenarios. Based on previous detailed analyses for the United States, an international expenditure of $4 billion per year seems more than justified.

1003240,"This paper discusses the prospects for using clean fuels and alternative vehicles to satisfy the sustainable development objectives which include reliable energy supply, affordable energy services and a cleaner environment for everyone. Transport energy demand is the most important driving force of increasing oil demand over the past thirty years, and accounts for almost half of the world oil consumption. Emissions from fuel combustion in conventional vehicles and the effects on air pollution are on-going concerns in both developed and developing countries. Concerns continue to grow over carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the context of global warming and climate change. Clean fuels and alternative vehicles offer considerable promise to achieve major reductions in air pollutants, as well as in CO2 emissions, and to meet other objectives of sustainable development such as reliable and affordable energy services.",Elena Tsioliaridou and George Bakos and NEBOJSA NAKICENOVIC,4,7181167105415151397,Published Online by WEC (World Energy Council).[Online].[Accessed 25/03/07].

The role of technology was largely ignored in the first round of global modeling efforts in the early 1970s, but it has recently moved to the forefront of both science and policy in addressing climate change. The long time span involved in climate change—from decades to centuries—puts technological change"" in the driver's seat,"" because over long time periods technological systems are highly malleable, whereas in the short run they are largely inflexible.Grübler, Nakicenovic, Nordhaus, and their distinguished contributors offer a unique, singlevolume overview of the most contemporary theoretical and empirical work on technological change.

1003243,"Our perception of the future is an evolving process. This is not otherwise for energy futures. Perceptions of global energy perspectives have changed dramatically during the last decades and continue to evolve. Often they represent mere extrapolations of current trends into the future; in more sophisticated approaches, they involve trend changes and emergence of new paradigms. No matter how simple or sophisticated the approach, our view of energy futures is arrested in the present. For example, as energy prices change, so do their future projections. This phenomenon is vividly illustrated by the past projections of international oil prices: As the price of oil fluctuated, so did the projections. The International Energy Workshop [1] documents numerous oil price projections during the last ten years that collectively portray this pattern.

1003244,"Consistent with the long-term dynamic transformation and structural change of the energy system is the possibility of less carbon intensive and even carbon-free energy as major sources of energy during the next century. Natural gas seems the likely transitional fuel that would enhance the reduction of other adverse impacts of energy use on the environment as well as substantial reductions of carbon dioxide (CO) emissions. Natural gas could be the bridge to carbon-free energy sources such as hydrogen (Nakićenović, 1993a).Global primary energy use has evolved from reliance on traditional energy sources to fossil fuel based first on coal and steam, then on oil and natural gas, and more recently,(but to a lesser extent) on nuclear and hydro energy.

1003247,"The IAEA nuclear material safeguards system consists basically of two different parts. One is the data verification scheme: the operators of nuclear plants report all relevant data on nuclear material processed in the plant to the safeguards authority. These data are then verified by the safeguards authority with independent measurements. The other part is the material accountability scheme: in case there are no significant differences between the operator's and the safeguards authority's data, all of the operator's data are taken for the nuclear material balance establishment.   The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the overall probability of detection of this system in case someone tries to divert material. This evaluation takes into account the different diversion strategies available. It is complicated because the two decision functions on which the evaluation is based -- the difference between operator's and inspector's data and the difference between book and physical inventory -- are stochastically dependent.

Yet, after the third of four preparatory meetings for WSSD (which ended in New York on 5 April), population considerations are absent from the planned agenda.   A plausible explanation for this absence is bureaucratic: in most countries inputs to Johannesburg are being prepared mainly by environment ministries that have little experience in dealing with population questions.

1003261,"The paper begins with an analysis of the growth of surface transport systems. We analyze ex post the convergent development of rail and road transport reaching divergent densities in different countries. This then serves as an illustrative case to investigate further the diffusion of the automobile, and to derive a global scenario for future automobile fleets. Based on our conclusions with respect to the future evolution of transport system structure and scenario of forthcoming global saturation in automobile diffusion, we then discuss the long-term development possibilities for more productive surface transport systems such as maglev trains. Ultimately, further increases in mobility would require the introduction of new and more productive and environmentally clean transport modes. This hypothesis will be used to determine what the possible effects would be if barriers to mobility are removed. Alternatives include examples of both the development of new physical infrastructures (e.g., a high-speed rail network) and the reduction of institutional and political obstacles (e.g., the former iron curtain). Imposition on new institutional and political barriers would have the opposite effect of reducing mobility and decoupling previous functional unities into separate entities.",N Nakicenovic,3,17028344889211566234,,,,,The Role of Surface Transportation: History of Development and Prospects for the Next Century,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/12982/,,1992,/scholar?cites=17028344889211566234,JobRFRAAAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC

The historically observed heterogeneity in the timing, duration, and adoption intensity of the diffusion of individual transport technologies is then used to sketch a  scenario of energy demand, and resulting carbon emissions from the passenger transport sector.   In this scenario, automobile and air transport in the industrialized countries approaches saturation in the next two to three decades. For developing countries, however, the scenario suggests that despite their high growth potential, they may not necessarily mimic the high adoption intensity of individual transport modes prevailing in  the industrialized countries. Combined with a continuation of historical rates of efficiency improvements, transportation energy demand and resulting carbon emissions could level off after the year 2000. Carbon emissions could be reduced significantly thereafter through the  penetration of electric- and hydrogen-powered vehicles in the industrialized countries. Such a scenario illustrates a possible future pathway contrasting conventional wisdom and giving some indication of the direction and time scale of technology and transport policy actions required to reconcile growing mobility with global environmental concerns.",A Grubler and N Nakicenovic and A Schaefer,3,17541102214470813785,Energy and Life,,,"RR-93-019.

1003265,"Solutions and problems are two inseparable partners in real life, in personal affairs, in business, in science and technology, and in national and international politics. Most of the time, problems search for solutions. Occasionally, a solution may be searching for problems.In business, life is filled with problems searching for solutions. Businessmen are so eager for new promising solutions that they often overreact. When they find that the promise is not there, they drop the"" solution"" like a hot potato. The rise and fall of"" Operational Research"" is a shining example. A major and perhaps the most difficult problem faced by business executives is: how to manage technological change? This problem has been searching for a solution since the industrial revolution; but none has been found. However, general patterns of regularities have been observed, eg, production capacity for a mature product tends to move gradually from high-wage to low-wage countries, which eventually become exporters to the high-wage countries. A closely related phenomenon associated with mature industries is the excess capacity problem. Today, there is excess capacity in petroleum refining, steel, aluminum, automobiles, traction equipment, farm equipment, steam turbines, generators, transformers, switchgear, shipbuilding, textiles, commodity chemicals, semiconductors-the list is long. How did business executives let that happen? Threats of excess capacity are on the horizon even for high-tech products such as commercial airliners, telecommunication equipment, and computers",Thomas Lee and Nebojsa Nakicenovic,3,10933266124735692569,"Life Cycles and Long Waves, Berlin: Springer-Verlag",,1-17,,Technology life cycles and business decisions,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/3355/1/XB-90-401.pdf#page=17,,1990,/scholar?cites=10933266124735692569,JobRFRAAAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC

1003268,"This is a report on the work done at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in 1976 to 1977 under a grant from Volkswagenwerk Foundation, whose objective was to explore the potential and the mechanisms of logistic analysis to describe the structure and the evolution of energy systems.   Volume One contains the phenomenological part. About 300 cases were examined, some of which are reported in detail. The quality of the logistic description is generally excellent, even for cases extending 150 years into the past and with all the perturbations such a long time span entails, and consequently we thought it appropriate to extend the description into the future and use it for prediction.   This was not really the objective of the grant but 'it naturally arises from the work and provides food for thought. Projections in the current literature appear to be in fact strongly inconsistent with the past, which casts doubts on their realizability, and are even internally inconsistent, which reinforces these doubts.   The fact that numerous ""free"" choices at the social level lead to very regular overall patterns should perhaps temper the feeling of being caught in a deterministic clockwork.   In Volume Two, devoted to the theoretical work, F. Fleck deals specifically with this problem showing the final regularity derived from a set of stochastic, i.e. ""free"", decisions. V. Peterka, on the other hand, operates at a more aggregated level, where one can start to speak of economic determinism. He describes a form of fate we are more ready to accept, if only grudgingly.

1003277,"This report presents national scenarios of economic activity (GDP) for the time period 1990 to 2100 based on three scenarios (A2, B1, and B2) from the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES; Nakicenovic et al, 2000). Two scenarios (B1 and B2) follow (with minor adjustments due to scenario improvements) the original SRES quantifications at the level of 4 and 11 world regions respectively. The quantification of the original SRES A2 scenario has been revised in order to reflect recent changing perceptions on the demographic outlook of world population growth. In this revised “high population growth” scenario A2 world population reaches some 12 billion by 2100 (as opposed to some 15 billion in the original SRES A2 scenario) and is characterized by a “delayed fertility transition” that is also mirrored in a delayed (economic) development catch-up. Our downscaling approach emphasizes the scenario dependency of the national development path. I.e., national income convergence within a region varies across the scenarios and is guided by the scenario’s specific assumptions for convergence on the macro-regional level. The approach explicitly distinguishes also between countries at different stages of economic development as opposed to earlier downscaling approaches which have employed the (by now widely recognized) problematic method of regionally uniform growth rates as  downscaling  algorithm. While the results are similar at the regional level to SRES, there are significant differences compared to earlier results from downscaling at the national level.",Keywan Riahi and Peter Kolp and A Grubler,2,13443688141420892325,,,,IR-05-063,National Scenarios of Economic Activity (GDP)-A Downscaling Analysis based on SRES,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/12544/,,2005,/scholar?cites=13443688141420892325,JobRFRAAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC

1003278,"There are concerns that in order to exploit the powerful new capabilities provided by the Information Technology Era, it is necessary to advance Future-oriented Technology Analysis (FTA) of both product and process. Among these new capabilities, the FTA Methods Working Group has recently identified three main converging areas of development: complex networks, simulation modeling of complex adaptive systems (CAS), and the search of vast databases. Such convergence has rejuvenated the growth of FTA methods and practice, much in accordance with the perspective envisioned in Linstone (1999), following his optimistic view of a strong, confident technology-driven scenario, which would bring a renewed impetus toward new methods in technological forecasting.   Focusing on new methods related to the new capabilities, we must borrow the discussion of methods and tools that have explosively grown in recent years in the fields of biosciences, bioinformatics and evolution. Among the needs for FTA envisioned by the FTA Methods Working Group, we find a questioning about the validity of the analogy between technological evolution and biological evolution (TFA Methods Working Group, 2004): Can artificial technological worlds be created by simulation modeling analogous to biological ones?

1003285,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) decided at its September 1996 plenary session in Mexico City to develop a new set of emissions scenarios to be used in its future work. The writing team formulated a set of 40 emissions scenarios. The scenarios are based on an extensive assessment of driving forces and emissions in the literature, six different integrated assessment modeling approaches, and an “open process” that solicited wide participation and feedback so as to reflect current understanding and knowledge about underlying uncertainties. The scenarios encompass different future developments that might influence greenhouse gas (GHG) sources and sinks, such as alternative structures of energy systems and land-use changes. They confirm that future greenhouse gas and sulfur emissions are the product of very complex dynamic systems, determined by driving forces such as population growth, socio-economic development and the rate and direction of technological change.

1003301,"Increasing human demands for water, energy, food and materials, are expected to accentuate resource supply challenges over the coming decades. Experience suggests that long-term strategies for a single sector could yield both trade-offs and synergies for other sectors. Thus, long-term transition pathways for linked resource systems should be informed using nexus approaches. Global integrated assessment models can represent the synergies and trade-offs inherent in the exploitation of water, energy and land (WEL) resources, including the impacts of international trade and climate policies. In this study, we review the current state-of-the-science in global integrated assessment modeling with an emphasis on how models have incorporated integrated WEL solutions. A large-scale assessment of the relevant literature was performed using online databases and structured keyword search queries. The results point to the following main opportunities for future research and model development:(1) improving the temporal and spatial resolution of economic models for the energy and water sectors;(2) balancing energy and land requirements across sectors;(3) integrated representation of the role of distribution infrastructure in alleviating resource challenges;(4) modeling of solution impacts on downstream environmental quality;(5) improved representation of the implementation challenges stemming from regional financial and institutional capacity;(6) enabling dynamic multi-sectoral vulnerability and adaptation needs assessment; and (7) the development of fully-coupled assessment frameworks based on consistent, scalable, and regionally …",Nils Johnson and Peter Burek and Edward Byers and Giacomo Falchetta and Martina Flörke and Shinichiro Fujimori and Petr Havlik and Mohamad Hejazi and Julian Hunt and Volker Krey and Simon Langan and Nebojsa Nakicenovic and Amanda Palazzo and Alexander Popp and Keywan Riahi and Michiel van Dijk and Michelle TH van Vliet and Detlef P van Vuuren and Yoshihide Wada and David Wiberg and Barbara Willaarts and Caroline Zimm and Simon Parkinson,1,740699645498542496,,11,2223,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Integrated solutions for the water-energy-land nexus: Are global models rising to the challenge?,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/11/11/2223,11,2019,/scholar?cites=740699645498542496,JobRFRAAAAAJ:gV6rEsy15s0C

1003303,"This article proposes the use of Big Data principles to support the future extraction of hydrocarbon resources. It starts out by assessing the possible energy-system transformations in order to shed some light on the future need for hydrocarbon resource extraction and corresponding drilling needs. The core contribution of this work is the development of a new database and the corresponding GIS (geographic information system) visualization project as basis for an analytical study of worldwide hydrocarbon occurrences and development of extraction methods. The historical period for the analytical study is from 1900 to 2000. A number of tasks had to be implemented to develop the database and include information about data collection, processing, and development of geospatial data on hydrocarbon deposits. Collecting relevant information made it possible to compile a list of hydrocarbon fields, which have served as the basis for the attribute database tables and its further filling. To develop an attribute table, the authors took into account that all accumulated data features on hydrocarbon deposits and divided them into two types: static and dynamic. Static data included the deposit parameters that do not change over time. On the other hand, dynamic data are constantly changing. Creation of a web service with advanced functionality based on the Esri Geoportal Server software platform included search by parameter presets, viewing and filtering of selected data layers using online mapping application, sorting of metadata, corresponding bibliographic information for each field and keywords accordingly.

Für den Übergang zur Nachhaltigkeit lassen sich aus diesen Umbrüchen mehrere Lehren ziehen: Zunächst, unhaltbare Zustände können auf dramatische Weise kollabieren. Ferner sind die Kräfte der Transformation oft lange unter der Oberfläche verborgen. Dies zeigt sich heute nicht zuletzt beim messbaren globalen Wertewandel in Richtung Nachhaltigkeit. Schließlich enthüllt der Zusammenbruch von auf Extraktion von Öl und Gas gestützten Diktaturen (Sowjetunion, Libyen) zugleich die versteckten Kosten des „fossilen “industriellen Metabolismus. Das kohlenstoffbasierte Weltwirtschaftsmodell ist auch ein normativ unhaltbarer Zustand, denn es gefährdet die Stabilität des Klimasystems und damit die Existenzgrundlagen künftiger Generationen.

Particularly rural households in India are relying mostly on traditional biomass to satisfy their basic energy needs with adverse effects on human health through indoor air pollution, but also on land degradation and labor productivity. This study presents a new generic modeling approach with the aim to explore response strategies for energy poverty eradication for India. The modeling approach explores characteristics of fuel consumption of the poorest through explicit representation of the main determinants of urban and rural energy fuel choice, including the effect of income distributions and capital scarcity on energy use as well as traditionally more intangible factors such as ""inconvenience costs""  or private discount rates. The methodology is applied to explore how different policy mechanisms such as fuel subsidies and microfinancing can enhance the diffusion of clean and affordable energy in India.

This is partly because the environmental consequences of social activity are frequently affected by the rate and direction of technological change, and partly because environmental policy interventions can themselves create constraints and incentives that have significant effects on the path of technological progress. This paper, prepared as a chapter draft for the forthcoming Handbook of Environmental Economics (North-Holland/Elsevier Science), summarizes for environmental economists current thinking on technological change in the broader economics literature, surveys the growing economic literature on the interaction between technology and the environment, and explores the normative implications of these analyses. We begin with a brief overview of the economics of technological change, and then examine three important areas where technology and the environment intersect: the theory and empirical evidence of induced innovation and the related literature on the effects of environmental policy on the creation of new, environmentally friendly technology; the theory and empirics of environmental issues related to technology diffusion; and analyses of the comparative technological impacts of alternative environmental policy instruments.

1003324,"The increasing concerns about the possibility of anthropologically induced global climate change have caused reevaluation of the future role of natural gas as a more environmentally benign fossil energy source. The combustion of natural gas results in lower carbon dioxide emissions compared to other fossil energy sources. For example, natural gas emits roughly one half of the carbon dioxide in comparison to coal for the equal amount of energy. However, natural gas consists mainly of methane and is a very potent greenhouse gas if released into the atmosphere. Fortunately releases of uncombusted methane can be controlled by appropriate mitigation measures, so that prudent use of natural gas can result in substantially lower energy-related emissions of greenhouse gases. Thus, a possible shift to a methane economy during the next decades offers a genuine mitigation strategy for anthropologically induced …",Sabine Messner and N Nakicenovic,1,3906075014306728848,,,,,The future of natural gas in Europe,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/4064/1/future%20gas.pdf,,1994,/scholar?cites=3906075014306728848,JobRFRAAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C

A short overview of oil price history is followed by a discussion of the factors that were responsible for previous, sometimes erratic, changes. We conclude that these factors are likely to maintain their influence in the future, thus giving the forecasts of oil prices a high uncertainty. This uncertainty is reflected in several reports containing oil price projections. We argue, therefore, that a question solely about future oil prices must remain unanswered. This does not render the efforts to examine the future futile; it simply means that the question should be rephrased. We offer one possible problem formulation that explicitly accounts for the high uncertainty. This formulation requires that specific policy problems and options for solving them be specified before oil prices are projected - a condition that does not always hold or, at least, that does not seem to be regarded as important enough to be described in many reports on oil price studies.",N Nakicenovic and Leo SchrattenhoLzer,1,10418021246098562850,,,,WP-85-068,The Value of Oil Price Projections,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/2633/,,1985,/scholar?cites=10418021246098562850,JobRFRAAAAAJ:CB2v5VPnA5kC

Volume One contains the phenomenological part. About 300 cases were examined, some of which are reported in detail. The quality of the logistic description is generally excellent, even for cases extending 150 years into the past and with all the perturbations such a long time span entails, and consequently we thought it appropriate to extend the description into the future and use it for prediction.   This was not really the objective of the grant but 'it naturally arises from the work and provides food for thought. Projections in the current literature appear to be in fact strongly inconsistent with the past, which casts doubts on their realizability, and are even internally inconsistent, which reinforces these doubts.   The fact that numerous ""free"" choices at the social level lead to very regular overall patterns should perhaps temper the feeling of being caught in a deterministic clockwork.   In Volume Two, devoted to the theoretical work, F. Fleck deals specifically with this problem showing the final regularity derived from a set of stochastic, i.e. ""free"", decisions. V. Peterka, on the other hand, operates at a more aggregated level, where one can start to speak of economic determinism. He describes a form of fate we are more ready to accept, if only grudgingly.

Yet stakeholders lack a shared understanding of how the 17 SDGs can be operationalized. Drawing on earlier work by The World in 2050 initiative, we introduce six SDG Transformations as modular building-blocks of SDG achievement: (1) education, gender and inequality; (2) health, well-being and demography; (3) energy decarbonization and sustainable industry; (4) sustainable food, land, water and oceans; (5) sustainable cities and communities; and (6) digital revolution for sustainable development. Each Transformation identifies priority investments and regulatory challenges, calling for actions by well-defined parts of government working with business and civil society. Transformations may therefore be operationalized within the structures of government while respecting the strong interdependencies across the 17 SDGs. We also outline an action agenda for science to provide the knowledge required for designing, implementing and monitoring the SDG Transformations.",J Sachs and G Schmidt-Traub and M Mazzucato and D Messner and N Nakicenovic and J Rockström,0,,Nature Sustainability,,,,Six Transformations to Achieve the SDGs,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/16045/?utm_source=miragenews&utm_medium=miragenews&utm_campaign=news,,2019,,JobRFRAAAAAJ:u3T1itk59dMC

Looking back, it is almost impossible to believe that digitalization is barely featured in the 2030 Agenda or the Paris Agreement. It is increasingly clear that digital changes, we refer to them as the Digital Revolution, are becoming a key driving force in societal transformation. The transformation towards sustainability for all must be harmonized with the threats, opportunities and dynamics of the Digital Revolution, the goals of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement.

1003354,"The world can be characterized by dynamics of acceleration. The African population will double during the next three decades; global urban infrastructures will double by 2050; to stay below the 2 C guardrail and to avoid dangerous climate change, emissions need to peak by 2020 and be reduced to zero by 2050; digitalization has the potential to substitute for a large percentage of currently existing jobs during the next two to three decades. The decisions of states, firms and political actors during the next one or two decades will create very long-term path dependencies in the emerging global society. Shaping globalization has, therefore, an important time dimension. Acceleration, path dependencies and very long-term impacts of current decisions need to be taken into account in Global Cooperation Research.

1003355,"Technology in the broader context of science and innovation is central to human and sustainable development. The main drivers of global change and the core resources for addressing sustainability challenges are people, their technology choices and behaviours. These drivers define the relationship amongst all forms of human capital (such as knowledge including know-how and know-why), natural capital (such as land, water, energy, or the atmosphere), and the services they provide (such as food, lighting and clean air) which are essential for wellbeing. Technology is a key determinant for which type of natural resources are used, at what level of efficiency, how the use of one resource affects others positively (through efficiency gains for example), or negatively (through waste or pollution). As such, technology is the main mediator between humanity and the environment.The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, or Goals) unanimously adopted in September 2015 by the United Nation’s General Assembly, set a very high ambition for socioeconomic development and environmental sustainability. Their resolution on Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development1 sets out 17 Goals to be achieved by 2030.

This conference contribution looks into the equality dimension of the Paris Climate Agreement and its (Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions, (I)NDCs.

We compare the Gini index of annual and cumulative national average per capita GHG emissions for the time frame 2015-2030 of conditional and unconditional (I)NDCs and set this into perspective with the recent evolution of GHG emissions equality.

For this, it is essential that the nexus and other dimensions needed to achieve decent and sustainable living for all become a development goal in its own right, as a systems concept. Treating the 17 SDGs adopted by the UN individually will hamper the realization of synergies and avoidance of conflicts and implementation barriers. Fortunately, there exist combinations of resources, technologies, lifestyles and policy frameworks that could provide a number of pathways toward fulfilling SDGs and achieving a long-term transformation toward sustainable future for all to the middle of the century and beyond. All of them imply a fundamental decarbonization and improved efficiencies of all human activities. Practically, this is about doing more with less. It is a paradigm-changing transformation. The dynamics of transformational change cannot be planned in detail; they are inherently unpredictable with emergent developments and dependent on human intentionality. The response strategies require deep systems understanding with adaptive approaches.

1003371,"Climate change, the Anthropocene, rising CO2 levels, the Earth Summit in Rio, wind turbines, combined heat and power generation, desertification, biodiversity loss, Germany's Renewable Energy Act, pioneers of change – what do all these terms mean exactly and how are they all linked? This comic offers answers.  The evidence for man-made climate change is overwhelming. Other global environmental changes, such as the loss of biodiversity, are closely linked to climate change and to our customary industrial economic practices. We can stop a global climate catastrophe if engineers, business people and policy-makers all pull together and if all work on the great transformation across national borders.  A major transformation is needed to stop climate change; in other words, we have to learn to live and to produce what we need in sustainable ways. Any transformation of society must begin in people's minds; only then can it be achieved technically with any chance of economic success. Scientists, politicians and citizens will have to work together to achieve this. In this comic, nine top scientists, the members of WBGU as comic-book heroes, show us that we can beat the heat – and how to do it!""",N Nakicenovic,0,,,,72-83,German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU),A Task for the Whole World.,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/12179/,,2014,,JobRFRAAAAAJ:tHtfpZlB6tUC

1003372,"This chapter focuses on the needs and opportunities as well as the constraints and barriers with respect to mitigation and adaptation to climate change. While the chapter concentrates mainly on Austria, information is provided on the global and EU level to the extent they are relevant for Austria. Section 1.1 discusses the targets already specified for mitigation at the global level, as well as technologies that are already available or are emerging with the potential to meet the challenges and associated costs. In particular, the progress achieved by IPCC and UNFCCC bodies, as well as EU policies and national scale policies and measures are reviewed. Section 1.2, on adaptation to climate change, addresses the different concepts developed at the international scale, reviews progress on the EU and Austrian national adaptation strategy, and characterizes the different types of adaptation relevant over short, medium and long term timescales. The costs of inaction are also addressed. Again, progress achieved by IPCC and UNFCCC bodies, as well as EU policies (green and white papers, etc.) and national scale policies and measures (national adaptation strategy) will be reviewed. This includes the progress made on adaptation planning, implementation, and integration in vulnerable sectors. Section 1.3 highlights the synergies and trade-offs that may emerge among adaptation and mitigation and hence explains the importance of a holistic approach. This also includes a discussion of mainstreaming of mitigation and adaptation into other policy areas.

1003393,"Worldwide, global energy systems face an array of challenges, from access for the poor to reliability and security. Meanwhile, the provision of energy creates local human and ecological health impacts as well as dangerous global climate change. Addressing these issues simultaneously will require a fundamental transformation of the energy system.

1003394,"The world faces the challenge of a global transformation to sustainable energy systems. Substantial up-front investments are needed to improve energy efficiency and switch to renewable energies. At the same time, these investments offer great opportunities, because strategic innovations can be triggered and new markets can develop in the course of the transformation process. Savings on the cost of fossil fuels in conventional technologies could completely offset the investment in renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency by as early as 2040. The private capital needed for the transformation is available and can be mobilised if a suitable political framework is put into place. A corresponding regulatory policy should be introduced to make such investment more attractive for the private sector. The WBGU advocates a proactive state that integrates energy, environmental and climate policy; this could reduce existing investment risks by developing a stable, long-term transformative regulatory framework. At the same time, policy makers should expand the opportunities for participation. Germany is currently leading this transformation, both in terms of technological innovations and in the creation of a suitable policy framework.

1003395,"Fundamental, game-changing transformations are needed for a shift toward more sustainable development pathways. The first fundamental transformation was the emergence of the Neolithic revolution that brought agriculture and permanent settlements some ten thousand years ago. The second started more than two centuries ago and is referred to as the Industrial Revolution that is still characterized by explosive, exponential growth that is encroaching planetary boundaries. The next fundamental transformation is already present in embryonic form and promoted by pioneers of change: individuals, firms, institutions, novel technologies, new preferences and behavioral patterns. The impact of these change agents is however blocked by the lock-in into the business-as-usual practices, policies, and infrastructures. The ever more evident crisis of the “old” development patterns is an opportunity for the “new” ones to emerge and diffuse resulting in the transformative change of the “sustainability revolution”. The presentation will outline some salient historical transformations with examples ranging from energy, water and food to mobility, information and new forms of governance.

1003402,"Energy and carbon intensities of aggregate economic activities, as measured by the gross domestic product, have generally been declining since the onset of in-dustrialization two centuries ago (Griibler and Nakicenovic 1996). This historical tendency can be observed for most countries, and for some throughout the industrialization process during the past two centuries, as will be shown for the United States (Nakicenovic 1996). This contrasts signiﬁcantly with the perspective provided by disaggregated energy and carbon intensities of individual economic sectors and activities, and even with short-term intensity increases in some countries (Schmalensee et al. 1998). An important part of the secular decline of energy and carbon intensities is the result of technological change. Technologies that are more energy efﬁcient have replaced less efﬁcient ones, and technologies that are less carbon intensive have replaced those that are more carbon intensive. In this way, technological change has made a major contribution to these long-term improvements in the productivity of energy. In particular, the decarbonization of energy—namely, the reduction of the speciﬁc carbon content of energy—can be represented by a learning curve and thus interpreted as a long-term learning process. In this chapter it is argued that an important component of the dynamics of technological change and diffusion is a cumulative process of learning by doing. Surely technology diffusion also takes place as a result of changes (decreases) in the price of a technology or changes (increases) in the price of a saved input (en—ergy), neither of which need be directly driven by a …",Nebojsa Nakicenovic,0,,Technological Change and the Environment,,160,Routledge,Technological Change and Diffusion as,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=8ieyxMJK6UIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA160&dq=info:zmBWwiCAm0cJ:scholar.google.com&ots=thD0WWoScD&sig=B064DcFIbL23Fh69hpYondJ8qCM,,2010,,JobRFRAAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C

1003403,"Technology is a double-edged sword for the environment: it can amplify as well as alleviate the impacts of human activities. The role of technology was largely ignored in the ﬁrst round of global modeling efforts in the early 1970s, but it has recently moved to the forefront of both science and policy in addressing cli—mate change. The long time span involved in climate change—from decades to centuries—puts technological change “in the driver’s seat,” because over long time periods technological systems are highly malleable, whereas in the short run they are largely inﬂexible.A brief look at the history of technology illustrates the enormous scope for change: a century ago the industrialized countries relied on a coal-fueled steam—engine economy. Current technologies such as instantaneous global electronic communication or heavier-than-air ﬂying machines were at most fantasies in the minds of science ﬁction writers. They were certainly not a source of inspiration for individuals in the newly founded research and development (R&D) laboratories. While it is easy to describe the enormous changes in technological hardware, software, and “orgware” that have characterized the past, and while it is compar—atively easy to speculate about possible future developments, it is much harder to discern the factors that have caused all these changes.

There is currently no prospect of the comprehensive and binding UN climate treaty -- the outcome hoped for at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference -- being achieved within the foreseeable future. However, in order to keep the global mean temperature rise below 2 degrees C by the end of the century, a resolute course must be set in the international climate process within the next few years. The German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) recommends that in order to revitalise the multilateral climate process, policy-makers and civil society in Europe take on a self-confident leading role in global alliances with selected ""climate pioneer"" countries and that more intensive support be provided for civil society initiatives. The aim of establishing a binding international regime to limit CO2 emissions -- based, for example, on the WBGU's own budget approach and similar approaches now also being discussed in China and India -- must remain in place.

At that time, the idea of developing both a near-and long-term experimental design that addressed questions around carbon cycle diagnostics, Earth system predictability as well as inertia of the climate system were introduced. From these discussions, a joint meeting was held in Aspen, Colorado (Aspen Global Change Institute) that included both the climate and integrated assessment modeling communities as well as representatives from the impacts, adaptation and vulnerability (IAV) research groups.

For the final negotiations on phase 3 of the EU Emissions Trading System we propose contributions on three issues: 1. operational procedures for dealing with carbon leakage and competitiveness in all sectors that provide criteria for allocating free allowances: 2. empowering the carbon market by extending the task of the emissions allowances issuing carbon authority to control the liquidity of the carbon market in view of stabilising the carbon price; 3. designing the auctioning mechanism by considering timing and auctioning as a strategic instrument for enhancing the carbon market and considering unified auc-tioning with revenues split among EU countries.

1003423,"We have earlier introduced the stabilization wedge as a useful unit for discussing climate stabilization. A wedge is l GtC/yr of emissions savings in 2055, achieved by a single strategy that will not occur without deliberate attention to global carbon. Implementing seven wedges should place humanity, approximately, on a path to stabilizing the climate at a concentration less than double the pre-inclustrial concentration, leaving those at the helm in the fol-lowing 50 years in a position to drive CO2 emissions to net zero emissions; arguably, the tasks of the two half-centuries are comparably difficult. We elaborate on the concept of the stabilization wedge that is achieved through carbon policy by introducing the ‘virtual ‘wedge that is achieved as a result of the continued decarbonization of the global economy even in the absence of carbon policy.

1003424,"In 2001 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a set of scenarios in the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). These scenarios have been developed in a four year process with many scientists involved in the writing and the review process. The SRES scenarios played an important role in the Third Assessment Report (TAR) of the IPCC and will be used in the upcoming Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The 21st IPCC plenary session (November 2003) decided that no new baseline scenario would be prepared for the AR4, in view of the time it takes before new scenarios are taken up by the research community and used in publications. The 23rd Panel session decided that two meetings under the auspices of Working Group III on the issue of the use of scenarios should take place. The first meeting aimed to discuss the use of SRES scenarios in AR4. This expert meeting took place 12–14 January 2005 in Washington DC and the results are available at http://www. ipcc. ch/meet/washington. pdfThe IPCC at its 22nd Session (November 2004) decided that possible future roles of IPCC in new scenarios (to be used for AR5) would be discussed at its 24th Session (26-28 September 2005, Montreal, Canada). To prepare for these discussions, a second meeting on new emission scenarios was held from 29 June–1 July 2005, hosted by IIASA in Laxenburg, Austria. It was decided that this meeting should be an IPCC Workshop with about 100 participants selected by the Chair of IPCC from government and organization nominations.",N Nakicenovic,0,,,,,,"Workshop on New Emission Scenarios: Meeting Report by the IPCC Working Group III Technical Support Unit, RIVM, Bilthoven, Netherlands",http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/7710/1/ipcc-workshop-2005-06.pdf,,2005,,JobRFRAAAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C

1003434,"Human-driven changes to many features of the Earth system have become so ubiquitous and significant in magnitude that a new era for the planet—the"" Anthropocene""—has been proposed (Crutzen and Stoermer2001; Clark et al., this volume). Many of these changes are large in magnitude at the planetary scale, sometimes even exceeding natural flows in major aspects of biogeochemical cycling. In addition, anthropogenic changes invariably occur at rates that are much larger than those of natural variability, often by an order of magnitude or more. The magnitudes and rates of these changes, coupled with the fact that changes to a large number of Earth system processes and compartments are occurring simultaneously, has led to the recognition that the Earth is now operating in a"" no-analogue state""(Steffen et al. 2004). The features of this no-analogue state present challenges to human responsiveness, challenges that have not been experienced in coping with any previous environmental changes, which have occurred at local and regional scales. These features include the facts that:• Large parts of the problem are global in scale, transcending any region, continent, or ocean basin on its own.• Connectivity between different biophysical processes and geographical areas of the planet is much greater than previously thought, and the connectivity of human activities is increasing at a rapid rate.• Human-driven changes to Earth system functioning operate on very long timescales, where the consequences of some human actions may be present for decades and centuries, and across very large space scales, where causes are spatially de-linked …",U CUBASCH and H HELD and N NAKICENOVIC,0,,Earth System Analysis for Sustainability,,313,MIT Press,Dynamics in the Anthropocene,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=OiU2VKZywVMC&oi=fnd&pg=PA313&dq=info:4gl6xNamQYYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=BV_kOwHBTY&sig=t7RzzILq-UdqK963nQvf5Y6xw-8,,2004,,JobRFRAAAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC

The main weakness is connected to the nature of climate change, namely, that the impacts are likely to be among the highest in the developing countries and that this is precisely the most uncertain part of these models. Most of them capture only the so-called market damages of climate change, while it is generally assumed that the largest share of expected damages cannot be valuated in a market place in monetary terms, at least not for the time being.

1003450,"The possibility of less carbon-intensive and even carbon-free energy as major sources of energy during the next century is consistent with the long-term dynamic transformation and structural change of the energy system. Natural gas seems the likely transitional fuel that would enhance the reduction in other adverse impacts of energy use on the environment as well as substantial reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Natural gas could be the bridge to carbonfree energy sources such as hydrogen (Nakicenovic, 1993a). Global primary energy use has evolved from reliance on traditional energy sources to being based on fossil fuels, first coal and steam then oil and natural gas, and more recently (but to a lesser extent) on nuclear and hydro energy. Figure 13.1 shows the competitive struggle among the five main sources of primary energy as a dynamic substitution process. Fuelwood and traditional energy sources dominated primary energy until 1880. Coal, the major energy source between 1880 and 1960, was the basis for the massive expansion of railroads and the growth of steel, steamships, and many other sectors. Since 1960, oil has assumed a dominant role at the same time as the automotive, petrochemical, and other industries have matured.

1003452,"Technologies to remove CO2 from power plant flue gases include amine absorption, membrane separation, and centrifugal separation (which is very expensive and not yet feasible). Today, all of the decarbonization technologies are very costly, about $100 per ton of carbon removed. Taking carbon out of flue gases also reduces the efficiency of the power plant and raises the cost of electricity by approximately 50 percent. Also discussed were technologies for removing or reducing carbon from the fuels themselves. These include gasifying coal and steam reforming natural gas. These technologies are quite expensive, in the range of $200 to $400 per ton with current economics. And once carbon is separated it must be stored. One project in Norway involves injecting CO2 into underwater aquifers in the North Sea, which is cost effective given Norway’s carbon tax. There are also projects which use CO2 for enhanced oil recovery or deposit it into depleted natural gas fields. One more controversial option is to deposit CO2 into the deep ocean; there are great concerns about the environmental impacts and costs of this.

The model optimizes the emissions trajectory given abatement costs which are related explicitly to both the degree and the rate of abatement.

Over the next half a century it might contribute up to, let us say, 50% of the potential improvement in energy services in the world. However, one cannot look at the technical energy efficiency improvement potential alone, one has to consider the systems context for efficiency improvements. One also has to look at end-use efficiencies, the structural change in energy end use, and the structural change in the energy system itself. Those factors might also be some of the major limiting factors in achieving high efficiency improvement potential.

1003483,"Starting with the three most important global energy flows (direct terrestrial solar radiation, earth rotation, geothermal energy of earth interior), the authors assess the technically usable potential of regenerative energies. This is shown on the background of the world energy demand of the next decades, expected to be in the range of 22 to 36 TWa/a for the year 2030. The potential of the following regenerative energy source is estimated: biomass, water power, wind power, geothermal energy, energy of the oceans, local (soft) solar energy. Further considerations touch on problems which occur on using regenerative energy sources, such as their low density of energy production and the ecological problems, especially on world-wide use of the biomass.",W Häfele and N Nakicenovic and H-H Rogner,0,,BRENNST-WARME-KRAFT,5,203-207,Springer-Verlag,Usable regenerative energy sources in the world,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/12795,33,1981,,JobRFRAAAAAJ:3NQIlFlcGxIC

1003484,"In view of the fact that the world's high-grade natural uranium resources are limited, alternative ways of using these resources more efficiently are of interest in the line of research undertaken by IIASA's Energy Systems Program. Sole reliance on the currently predominant Light Water Reactors (LWRs) would mean to deplete these natural uranium resources rapidly.   The present paper considers different strategies of uranium use involving, in addition to burners (LWRs), Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) and Advanced Converter Reactors (ACR) with an extremely high efficiency in using natural uranium. Breeder reactors in fact require only depleted natural uranium (left over from enriched LWR fuel), once a certain endowment of fissile plutonium (from burnt LWR fuel) has accumulated. Given such an endowment, the breeder output can be increased on the basis of self-generated plutonium. Although the efficiency in using natural uranium is less in advanced converter reactors, their uranium savings are enormous compared to the amounts used up in burners. Such considerations of a more efficient future uranium use by deploying advanced reactors in addition to burner reactors are based on a hypothetical trajectory of a total installed nuclear capacity increasing to 10 TW(e) by the year 2030. The analysis shows that a combination of advanced and burner reactors, as compared to the use of burners only, could lead to cumulative, high-grade uranium savings greater than 70% from 1980 to 2030.",N Nakicenovic and AM Perry,0,,,,,WP-79-129,Nuclear Development Strategies with Limited Natural Uranium Requirements,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/1054/,,1979,,JobRFRAAAAAJ:3bvyWxjaHKcC

In other words, the Anthropocene has arrived, and with it an unprecedented opportunity to steer our collective future.Science, technology, and innovation (STI) are the drivers of this change, and can also be the means of achieving a sustainable, equitable, and resilient future for both human civilization and the biosphere. These tools, however, need to be complemented with the necessary evolutions of our economies, public institutions, and behavioral norms. The rapid rise in inequality and resource consumption over the last few decades, for example, has led to increasing pressure on people and the planet in ways that are clearly unsustainable.

New technologies commonly need high investment on R&D and demonstration projects at their early stages, and with the increase of accumulated experience in new technologies, costs of using them tend to decrease.

1003511,"At least since the oil crises of the 1970s and the dramatic price drop in the mid-1980s forecasting the oil price development has been a major challenge for energy economists world-wide. Yet, as Fig. 1 shows it is amazing that most economists guessed considerably wrong. The most famous–and most embarrassing–desaster in this context was the report EMF 6 (1984) where the most famous energy economists of the US predicted a further considerable rise in oil prices after 1985 to 100 US $ and more. And Fig. 1 also shows that the experts participating in the IEW virtually uniformly made the wrong predictions at virtually every IEW poll. What we know from today and from some major papers of Wirl (eg Wirl (1990)) is that a lot of features and indicators in the development in the early 1980s were completely misinterpreted.",Reinhard HAAS and Nebojsa NAKICENOVIC and Andreas MÜLLER and Christian REDL and Gustav RESCH and Hans AUER and Amela AJANOVIC and Lukas KRANZL and Thomas FABER,0,,,,,,AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL LESSONS LEARNED WITH RESPECT TO IMPACT PARAMETERS ON THE OIL PRICE,http://www.usaee.org/usaee2008/submissions/OnlineProceedings/Reinhard%20Haas.pdf,,,,JobRFRAAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC

1003512,"This report presents a comprehensive framework to link Austria’s greenhouse gas emissions directly to possible abatement measures. Emission sources are grouped into “entities”, which describe the magnitude of an activity and its related emissions. Entities are selected such that external projections can be taken to characterize their current and future activity level, and that they comprise all emission sources. The framework attributes abatement measures to specific entities and describes their respective effects in terms of abatement efficiency, applicability, influence towards activity of entities (also cross-influence to other entities) and costs. It is thus able to cover also cascading influences as in the energy chain. In contrast to the entities, the measures presented in this report are not meant to be comprehensive. Instead, they serve as examples and are so far limited to those determined by technology (in a general sense) and do not include change of lifestyle. The framework allows a consistent examination across sectors, such that abatement costs as well as abatement potentials can be compared directly. In order to demonstrate the opportunities provided, we have applied this framework to Austrian projections for the years 2020 and 2050, and provided a set of measures under different scenarios.",Wilfried Winiwarter and Barbara Amon and Martina Fröhlich and Ernst Gebetsroither and Andreas Müller and Nebojsa Nakicenovic and Marion Ramusch and Melanie Sporer,0,,,,,,reclip: tom,https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/PubDat_183970.pdf,,,,JobRFRAAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC

1003513,"This work is dedicated to the empirical testing and theoretical formulation of an invariant, the logistic learning curve, as it applies to the structural evolution of energy systems and systems related to energy, such as coal mining. The great success of the model in organizing past data and the insensitivity to major political and economic perturbations of the structures obtained seem to lend great predictive power to this invariant. A total of about 300 cases was examined, the USA being particularly well represented. Since supertankers have made the energy system a world system, the case of the world as a whole was given special attention for its political and resource implications.",C Marchetti and N Nakicenovic,0,,,PB-80-169642,,"International Inst. for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg (Austria)",The dynamics of energy systems and the logistic substitution model.

1003514,"Based on earlier, pioneering work done at IIASA, this paper presents a model of endogenous technological change under the three potential most important “stylized facts”: increasing returns to adoption, uncertainty, and heterogeneous agents following diverse technology development and adoption strategies. As an intermediary step towards the final, long-term research objective of developing a multi-agent model, this paper deals with two heterogeneous agents, a risk-taking one and a risk-aversion one. Interactions between the two agents include trade on resource and good, and technological spillover (“free-riding” and technology trade). With the two heterogeneous agents, we run optimization to minimize their aggregated costs to find out what rational behaviors are under different assumptions if the two agents are somehow cooperative. The global optimal solutions of the two-agent model are of Pareto …",Tieju Ma and Nebojsa Nakicenovic,0,,,,,,Interim Report IR-06-044 An Agent-Based Model of Endogenous Technological Change–An Extension to the Grubler-Gritsevskyi Model,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2525343320774862927&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,JobRFRAAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C

1003515,"The study’s objectives: Estimates of 21st Century global-mean surface temperature increase have generally been based on scenarios that do not include climate policies. For instance, IPCC’s 4th Assessment Report recently projected that by 2100, global mean surface temperature would increase by 1.1–6.4 C over the 1990 level. This range, however, is based solely on scenarios without climate policy–leaving the question on how climate policy could influence this range completely unanswered. A recently published paper by us has now extended these estimates by assessing the possible impacts of climate policies on projected warming ranges using newly developed multigas mitigation scenarios, based on a wide range of modeling approaches (van Vuuren et al. 2008). The article assesses the atmospheric CO2 concentrations, radiative forcing, and temperature increase for these new scenarios using two …",Detlef P van Vuuren and M Meinshausen and GK Plattner and F Joos and KM Strassman and SJ Smith and TML Wigley and SCB Raper and K Riahi and P de la Chesnaye and MGJ den Elzen and J Fujino and K Jiang and N Nakicenovic and S Paltsev and JM Reilly,0,,,,,,P49. 05 Temperature increase of 21st century mitigation scenarios,http://download.iop.org/ees/ees9_6_492012.pdf,,,,JobRFRAAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC
