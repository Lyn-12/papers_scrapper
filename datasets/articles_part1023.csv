1023000,"Partitioning and scheduling are two central issues in the design of embedded systems since they can widely influence the characteristics of the system under design. The numerous constraints imposed by the environment and/or the underlying target architecture of mixed systems (containing hardware and software parts) make these two problems hard to solve.

As a result, the interest in heuristics and meta-heuristics is still growing. In this paper, we present a very recent metaheuristic introduced to solve a 3-sat problem.

The authors deal with pseudo-random testing and present a method of condensing test points based on the notion of fault sector. Based on a set of proposed heuristics, a tool for automatically inserting test points was developed. Experimental results obtained with the tool are presented to indicate that excellent pseudo-random testability can be achieved with few test points. This technique leads to the lowest reported number of test points while significantly reducing the number of random patterns which are required to achieve very close to 100% fault coverage.< >",Y Savaria and M Youssef and B Kaminska and M Koudil,61,4558512730550655954,,,1960-1963,IEEE,Automatic test point insertion for pseudo-random testing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/176793/,,1991,/scholar?cites=4558512730550655954,9Zbx-EYAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC

Like most machine learning methods for data classification and information retrieval, they require manually labeled data samples in the training stage.

We consider in this paper the Shortest Path routing Tree (SPT) problem in WSN under different metrics; we show that the basic SPT based strategies are unsuitable for the many-to-one WSN when considering some metrics to compute link costs. Indeed, existing SPT approaches aim to construct a tree rooted at the sink such that the cost of the path from any node to the sink is minimal, while the cost of a given path is computed as summation of the costs of links that compose this path. However, in many-to-one WSN, links which are close to the sink are more critical than other links when using some metrics.

Solutions proposed in the recent literature target these objectives, but tackle them from either client or server side separately.

Effectively, information available at the client side, such as buffer occupancy, available throughput, and previous played representation levels, can be used to better control the video streaming efficiency and stability at the client side.

1023053,"In the context of wireless instrumentation systems, we proposed the MWAC model to enable reliable communications between sensors. This model, based on a self-organization process, is operational and has been usefully deployed on real world wireless sensors networks. However, for some applications, MWAC presents an important limitation. In fact, for a given emergent structure, the process offers only one path to join the workstation which collects all the data.

This paper presents a first improvement of the MWAC model using an ant colony optimization.

1023056,"Network on chip (NoC) design gained a lot of attention in recent years, this is due to the performance provided by this new System-on-Chip (SoC) interconnect paradigm. Several research issues related to N oC design are addressed. Therefore, developing simulators and tools for evaluating NoC performance, has become of paramount importance. Reliability, is one of the most important and critical features that must be considered by network on chip designers in the early stages of design. In this paper, we present a new platform named FTNoCSim, based on OMNeT++ framework. Its architecture is designed to make easier the implementation and the evaluation of innovative fault tolerance techniques for three layers of the NoC OSI model: data link, network and transport layers. FTNoCSim users can explore basic concepts of NoC or assess their designs in terms of reliability, latency and power consumption.

Elle peut aider les collectifs à réaliser leurs propres productions ou à les renforcer.

1023066,"Les accélérateurs matériels ont été depuis longtemps utilisés pour booster les performances dans les MPSoC. Cependant, ces derniers introduisent un surplus d’occupation de surface sur ces systèmes. Le travail présenté dans cet article présente un outil pour trouver un compromis entre l’accélération apportée par ces accélérateurs matériels et la surface occupée par ces derniers. Pour ce faire, nous proposons d’utiliser un nouveau type d’architectures basé sur le partage d’accélérateurs matériels. Nous présentons une approche d’exploration de l’espace de conception (ou DSE pour Design Space Exploration) basée sur un algorithme génétique hybridé à un nouveau type de recherche locale (PVNS), pour l’exploration bi-objectif de l’espace de conception, dans les architectures à base de partage d’accélérateurs matériels. L’approche proposée a été testée sur trois applications: le Multiple Target Tracking (MTT), le JPEG et une application synthétique. Notre algorithme apporte un gain en temps d’exploration pouvant atteindre les 99.86% par rapport aux travaux existants basés sur un modèle mixte de programmation linéaire en nombres entiers (MILP), tout en y ajoutant la considération de la contrainte d’accélération.
