They completed 80 rounds (240 trials) of a strategic sequential investment task that required accepting interim losses in order to access a lucrative state and maximize long-term gains. while being scanned. We extended the standard Q-learning model by incorporating both counterfactual gains and losses into separate error signals. The FPE model explained the participants' data significantly better …,True,tAjtMvUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,22,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811913012007,10005098141320845862,/scholar?cites=10005098141320845862,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rong_Guo8/publication/259252071_Neural_Systems_for_Choice_and_Valuation_with_Counterfactual_Learning_Signals/links/5b072808aca2725783df619f/Neural-Systems-for-Choice-and-Valuation-with-Counterfactual-Learning-Signals.pdf,0,1,1,Pe6nV0IAAAAJ | qG7UQVcAAAAJ | w2M4elUAAAAJ | wI5MV8IAAAAJ | 1jj1F44AAAAJ | GC8NHvQAAAAJ | llo3F3QAAAAJ | ah3qaYcAAAAJ | pGKzaMMAAAAJ | k3u6_ZIAAAAJ
31,7180,Brain fMRI processing and classification based on combination of PCA and SVM,2009.0,Song-yun Xie and Rong Guo and Ning-fei Li and Ge Wang and Hai-tao Zhao,,,,3384-3389,IEEE,fMRI is one of the fundamental tools for functional human brain research. However. fMRI data are often in a high dimensional feature space and suffer greatly from large and complex dataset. To relieve the curse of dimensionality in fMRI image. PCA combines with SVM to form a feature-based classification method in this work. PCA is employed to find a more compact and reasonable representation of the data by extracting features from each fMRI image. Then a linear kernel SVM classifier is trained on the selected features to detect different brain states. The advantage of incorporating PCA with SVM is twofold: Firstly. the computational burden on SVM classifier is reduced significantly. Secondly. a less complex classifier is well established. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields good performance. The correct rate of our hand-movement fMRI study with both healthy subjects and a tumor patient …,True,tAjtMvUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,18,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5179085/,16605493994629708041,/scholar?cites=16605493994629708041,,,0,1,1,None | BC0dWQsAAAAJ | None | pjK2mQwAAAAJ | None
32,7181,Interaction of instrumental and goal-directed learning modulates prediction error representations in the ventral striatum,2016.0,Rong Guo and Wendelin Böhmer and Martin Hebart and Samson Chien and Tobias Sommer and Klaus Obermayer and Jan Gläscher,36.0,Journal of Neuroscience,50,12650-12660,Society for Neuroscience,Goal-directed and instrumental learning are both important controllers of human behavior. Learning about which stimulus event occurs in the environment and the reward associated with them allows humans to seek out the most valuable stimulus and move through the environment in a goal-directed manner. Stimulus–response associations are characteristic of instrumental learning. whereas response–outcome associations are the hallmark of goal-directed learning. Here we provide behavioral. computational. and neuroimaging results from a novel task in which stimulus–response and response–outcome associations are learned simultaneously but dominate behavior at different stages of the experiment. We found that prediction error representations in the ventral striatum depend on which type of learning dominates. Furthermore. the amygdala tracks the time-dependent weighting of stimulus–response versus …,True,tAjtMvUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,6,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/50/12650.abstract,17285727328738213922,/scholar?cites=17285727328738213922,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/36/50/12650.full.pdf,0,1,1,BC0dWQsAAAAJ | wI5MV8IAAAAJ | Q-n9_FgAAAAJ | None | k3u6_ZIAAAAJ | pGKzaMMAAAAJ | 1jj1F44AAAAJ

Decision making and the neural circuitry for counterfactual processing are altered in healthy elderly adults. This experiment investigated age differences in neural systems for decision making with knowledge of counterfactual outcomes. Two groups of healthy adult participants. young (N = 30; ages 19–30 years) and elderly (N = 19; ages 65–80 years). were scanned with fMRI during 240 trials of a strategic sequential investment task in which a particular strategy of differentially weighting counterfactual gains and losses during valuation is associated with more optimal performance.

34,7183,Non-deterministic policy improvement stabilizes approximated reinforcement learning,2016.0,Wendelin Böhmer and Rong Guo and Klaus Obermayer,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.07548,,,,This paper investigates a type of instability that is linked to the greedy policy improvement in approximated reinforcement learning. We show empirically that non-deterministic policy improvement can stabilize methods like LSPI by controlling the improvements' stochasticity. Additionally we show that a suitable representation of the value function also stabilizes the solution to some degree. The presented approach is simple and should also be easily transferable to more sophisticated algorithms like deep reinforcement learning.,True,tAjtMvUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07548,3975942193121744516,/scholar?cites=3975942193121744516,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07548,0,1,1,wI5MV8IAAAAJ | BC0dWQsAAAAJ | pGKzaMMAAAAJ

In order to cope with the self-interference (SI) induced by the FD mode of operation. a self-interference cancellation (SIC) scheme is utilized at each node in the proposed system. The performance of the proposed system is thoroughly investigated in the presence of residual SI by deriving a closed-form expression for the distribution of the tight upper bound end-to-end (E2E) signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR). Furthermore. an exact closed-form expression for the tight upper bound ergodic capacity is derived and used to evaluate the E2E upper bound ergodic capacity of the proposed AF-FD-PLNC system.
