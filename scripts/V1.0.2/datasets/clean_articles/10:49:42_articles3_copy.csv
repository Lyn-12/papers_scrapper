They completed 80 rounds (240 trials) of a strategic sequential investment task that required accepting interim losses in order to access a lucrative state and maximize long-term gains. while being scanned.

7180,Brain fMRI processing and classification based on combination of PCA and SVM,2009.0,Song-yun Xie and Rong Guo and Ning-fei Li and Ge Wang and Hai-tao Zhao,,,,3384-3389,IEEE,fMRI is one of the fundamental tools for functional human brain research. However. fMRI data are often in a high dimensional feature space and suffer greatly from large and complex dataset. To relieve the curse of dimensionality in fMRI image. PCA combines with SVM to form a feature-based classification method in this work. PCA is employed to find a more compact and reasonable representation of the data by extracting features from each fMRI image. Then a linear kernel SVM classifier is trained on the selected features to detect different brain states. The advantage of incorporating PCA with SVM is twofold: Firstly. the computational burden on SVM classifier is reduced significantly. Secondly. a less complex classifier is well established. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields good performance.

Learning about which stimulus event occurs in the environment and the reward associated with them allows humans to seek out the most valuable stimulus and move through the environment in a goal-directed manner. Stimulus–response associations are characteristic of instrumental learning. whereas response–outcome associations are the hallmark of goal-directed learning. Here we provide behavioral. computational. and neuroimaging results from a novel task in which stimulus–response and response–outcome associations are learned simultaneously but dominate behavior at different stages of the experiment. We found that prediction error representations in the ventral striatum depend on which type of learning dominates.

We show empirically that non-deterministic policy improvement can stabilize methods like LSPI by controlling the improvements' stochasticity.

This has highlighted the need for an efficient frequency-reuse technique that can meet the ever-increasing demand on the available frequency resources. In-band full-duplex (FD) wireless technology that enables the transceiver nodes to transmit and receive simultaneously over the same frequency band. has gained tremendous attention as a promising technology to double the spectral efficiency of the traditional half-duplex (HD) systems. However. this technology faces a formidable challenge. that is the large power difference between the self-interference (SI) signal and the signal of interest from a remote transceiver node. In this thesis. we focus on the architecture of the FD transceivers and investigate their ability to approximately double the throughput and the spectral efficiency of the conventional HD systems. Moreover. this thesis is concerned with the design of efficient self-interference cancellation schemes that can be combined with the architecture of the FD transceiver nodes in order to effectively suppress the SI signal and enable the FD mode. In particular. an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) based amplify-and-forward (AF) FD physical-layer network coding (PLNC) system is proposed.

This paper presents characterization results of the self-interference (SI) channel from experimental data obtained by sea trials in the North Sea. Two scenarios are considered. ie hard and soft sea bottom with water column depths of 50 m. Initial results indicate that the delay spread of the local reverberation can extend up to 1.5 s before it reaches the noise floor level. This in turn has significant implications on the required hardware complexity of the SI mitigation methods based on adaptive filter echo cancellation. which will require tens of thousands of filter taps to deal with this delay spread range and prolonged training periods.

However. its intermittent. unstable and stochastic nature hampers its representation among other renewable energy sources. This work addresses the forecasting of wind speed. a primary input needed for wind energy generation. using data obtained from the South African Wind Atlas Project. Forecasting is carried out on a two days ahead time horizon. We investigate the predictive performance of artificial neural networks (ANN) trained with Bayesian regularisation. decision trees based stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) and generalised additive models (GAMs). The results of the comparative analysis suggest that ANN displays superior predictive performance based on root mean square error (RMSE). In contrast. SGB shows outperformance in terms of mean average error (MAE) and the related mean average percentage error (MAPE). A further comparison of two forecast combination methods involving the linear and additive quantile regression averaging show the latter forecast combination method as yielding lower prediction accuracy. The additive quantile regression averaging based prediction intervals also show outperformance in terms of validity. reliability. quality and accuracy. Interval combination methods show the median method as better than its pure average counterpart.

Despite many years of research. definitive evidence that genetic effects operate in this way is lacking.
