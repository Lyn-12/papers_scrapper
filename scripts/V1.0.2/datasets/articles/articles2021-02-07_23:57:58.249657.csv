By contrast. little is known about the genetic basis of variation in protein levels in genetically diverse populations. in large part because techniques for large-scale measurements of protein abundance lag far behind those for measuring transcript abundance.

SOX2 appears to re-activate in several human cancers including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). however. the detailed response program of SOX2 in GBM has not yet been defined. We show that knockdown of the SOX2 gene in LN229 GBM cells reduces cell proliferation and colony formation. We then comprehensively characterize the SOX2 response program by an integrated analysis using several advanced genomic technologies including ChIP-seq. microarray profiling. and microRNA sequencing. Using ChIP-seq technology. we identified 4883 SOX2 binding regions in the GBM cancer genome. SOX2 binding regions contain the consensus sequence wwTGnwTw that occurred 3931 instances in 2312 SOX2 binding regions. Microarray analysis identified 489 genes whose expression altered in response to SOX2 knockdown. Interesting findings include that SOX2 regulates the expression of SOX family proteins SOX1 and SOX18. and that SOX2 down regulates BEX1 (brain expressed X-linked 1) and BEX2 (brain expressed X-linked 2). two genes with tumor suppressor activity in GBM. Using next generation sequencing. we identified 105 precursor microRNAs (corresponding to 95 mature miRNAs) regulated by SOX2. including down regulation of miR-143. -145. -253-5p and miR-452.

Here. we demonstrate that a T6S integral membrane toxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tse6. acts on target cells by degrading the universally essential dinucleotides NAD+ and NADP+. Structural analyses of Tse6 show that it resembles mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase proteins. such as diphtheria toxin. with the exception of a unique loop that both excludes proteinaceous ADP-ribose acceptors and contributes to hydrolysis. We find that entry of Tse6 into target cells requires its binding to an essential housekeeping protein. translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu).

Human clinical isolates of Ft produce lipid A of similar structure to Ft subspecies novicida (Fn). a pathogen of mice. We identified three enzymes required for Fn lipid A carbohydrate modifications. specifically the presence of mannose (flmF1). galactosamine (flmF2). or both carbohydrates (flmK). Mutants lacking either galactosamine (flmF2) or galactosamine/mannose (flmK) addition to their lipid A were attenuated in mice by both pulmonary and subcutaneous routes of infection. In addition. aerosolization of the mutants (flmF2 and flmK) provided protection against challenge with wild-type (WT) Fn. whereas subcutaneous administration of only the flmK mutant provided protection from challenge with WT Fn.

EPEC uses a type III secretion system (TTSS) to inject bacterial proteins into the cytosol of intestinal epithelial cells. resulting in diarrhea. We analyzed the host response to TTSS-delivered EPEC effector proteins by infecting polarized intestinal epithelial monolayers with either wild-type or TTSS-deficient EPEC. Host proteins were isolated and subjected to quantitative profiling using isotope-coded affinity tagging (ICAT) combined with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. We identified over 2000 unique proteins from infected Caco-2 monolayers. of which ∼13% are expressed differentially in the presence of TTSS-delivered EPEC effector proteins. We validated these …,True,iExS8vMAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,97,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820671289,7691381668055212687,/scholar?cites=7691381668055212687,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820671289,0,0,0

As a model of this interaction. we sought to determine whether colonization of the murine host with symbiotic non‐toxigenic Bacteroides fragilis could limit acquisition of pathogenic enterotoxigenic B. fragilis. We observed strain‐specific competition with toxigenic B. fragilis. dependent upon type VI secretion. identifying an effector–immunity pair that confers pathogen exclusion. Resistance against host acquisition of a second non‐toxigenic strain was also uncovered. revealing a broader function of type VI secretion systems in determining microbiota composition. The competitive exclusion of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis by a non‐toxigenic strain limited toxin exposure and protected the host against intestinal inflammatory disease.

By employing phosphodiesterase to remove the majority of the poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) modification. we reduce the complexity of tandem mass spectrometric analysis of pADPr-modified tryptic peptides. The simplified ribose-5′-phosphate form of the peptides produce tandem mass spectra by CID that are readily interpreted and enable effective localization of the exact sites of PARP-1-catalyzed poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. In conjunction with a phosphopeptide-like enrichment strategy that captures the ribose-5′-phosphate peptides. we identified eight novel sites of PARP-1 automodification. confirmed the localization of two sites previously reported. and provided evidence for two additional targeted peptides …,True,iExS8vMAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC,92,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr301219h,10078813126237444279,/scholar?cites=10078813126237444279,,,0,0,0

Interestingly. artemisinin has displayed anti-cancer activity with artemisinin dimers being more potent than monomeric artemisinin. Intracellular iron uptake is regulated by the transferrin receptor (TfR). and the activity of artemisinin depends on the availability of iron. We examined the level of TfR in prostate cancer (PCa) tumor cells. synthesized two new artemisinin dimers. and evaluated the effect of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and artemisinin dimers ON-2Py and 2Py on proliferation and apoptosis in PCa cells. TfR was expressed in the majority of PCa bone and soft tissue metastases. all twenty-four LuCaP PCa xenografts. and PCa cell lines. After treatment with DHA.

To facilitate characterization of protein−protein interactions using mass spectrometry. a new data acquisition/analysis pipeline was designed. The goal for this pipeline was to provide a generic strategy for identifying cross-linked peptides from single LC/MS/MS data sets. without using specialized cross-linkers or custom-written software. To achieve this. each peptide in the pair of cross-linked peptides was considered to be “post-translationally” modified with an unknown mass at an unknown amino acid. This allowed use of an open-modification search engine. Popitam. to interpret the tandem mass spectra of cross-linked peptides.

The type VI secretion system (T6SS) encoded by the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI) is critical for the virulence of this organism. Existing studies suggest that the complete repertoire of T6SS effectors delivered to host cells is encoded by the FPI. Using a proteome-wide approach. we discovered that the FPI-encoded T6SS exports at least three effectors encoded outside of the island. These proteins share features with virulence determinants of other pathogens. and we provide evidence that they can contribute to intramacrophage growth. The remaining proteins that we identified are encoded within the FPI. Two of these FPI-encoded proteins constitute effectors. whereas the others form a unique complex required for core function of the T6SS apparatus.

These instruments offer the possibility to transfer fragment ions from the linear ion trap to the FT-based analyzer for analysis with both high resolution and high mass accuracy. In addition. performing CID during the transfer of ions from the linear ion trap (LTQ) to the FT analyzer is also possible in instruments containing an additional collision cell (i.e.. the “C-trap” in the LTQ-Orbitrap). resulting in tandem mass spectra over the full m/z range and not limited by the ejection q value of the LTQ.

In practice it stands in stark contrast to the hypothesis-driven serial approach practiced in the last century that was so successful for protein chemists and is built on the basic understanding of protein physicochemical properties developed during that era. Proteomics attempts to study biological processes comprehensively or globally by systematic parallel analysis of proteins expressed in a cell.

Induction of epithelial differentiation is organ-specific. and the genes responsible could be identified through a comparative genomic analysis of the stromal cells from two different organs. These genes might be aberrantly expressed in cancer since cancer could be viewed as due to a defect in stromal signaling. We propose to identify the prostate stromal genes by analysis of differentially expressed genes between prostate and bladder stromal cells. and to examine their expression in prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies to cluster designation (CD) cell surface antigens was first used to characterize the stromas of the prostate and bladder. Stromal cells were prepared from either prostate or bladder tissue for cell culture. RNA was isolated from the cultured cells and analyzed by DNA microarrays. Expression of candidate genes in normal prostate and prostate cancer was examined by RT-PCR. The bladder stroma was phenotypically different from that of the prostate. Most notable was the presence of a layer of CD13+ cells adjacent to the urothelium. This structural feature was also seen in the mouse bladder. The prostate stroma was uniformly CD13-. A number of differentially expressed genes between prostate and bladder stromal cells were identified. One prostate gene. proenkephalin (PENK). was of interest because it encodes a hormone.

The complication arises when chromatographic peak widths for a given analyte exceed the time required to acquire a precursor ion mass spectrum. The result is that many measured monoisotopic masses are misassigned due to calculation from a single mass spectrum with poor ion statistics based on only a fraction of the total available ions for a given analyte. Such data in turn produces errors in automated database searches. where precursor m/z value is one search parameter.

These experiments provided a comprehensive view on the protein species; especially for different glycosylation level in these two proteins. which showed good agreement with oligosaccharide profiling. Top- and middle-down MS provided additional information regarding glycosylation sites and different combinational protein species that were not available from oligosaccharide mapping or conventional bottom-up …,True,iExS8vMAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC,37,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874391915301640,15879045271248836676,/scholar?cites=15879045271248836676,,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/29182/1/Kilgour_JOP.pdf,0,0,0

Given the heterogeneity of the symptoms. multiple pathophysiologic factors are suspected to play a role. We classified women with IBS into four subgroups based on distinct symptom profiles. In-depth shotgun proteomic analysis was carried out to profile the urinary proteomes to identify possible proteins associated with these subgroups. First void urine samples with urine creatinine level ≥100 mg/dL were used after excluding samples that tested positive for blood. Urine from 10 subjects representing each symptom subgroup was pooled for proteomic analysis. The urine proteome was analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) using a data-independent method known as Precursor Acquisition Independent From Ion …,True,iExS8vMAAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC,37,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr3004437,1015517153411546562,/scholar?cites=1015517153411546562,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3631108/,0,0,0

The Bering Sea is a highly productive system dominated by seasonal blooms and was used as a model system for algal proteins to be tracked through the water column and incorporated into detrital sedimentary material. Samples of suspended and sinking particles were collected at multiple depths along with surface sediments on the continental shelf and deeper basin of the Bering Sea. Modified standard proteomic preparations were used in conjunction with high pressure liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry to identify the suite of proteins present and monitor changes in their distribution. In surface waters 207 proteins were identified. decreasing through the water column to 52 proteins identified in …,True,iExS8vMAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C,37,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703712000129,3978047778557761747,/scholar?cites=3978047778557761747,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3375732/,0,0,0
76075,Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis using PAcIFIC for the identification of plasma diagnostic biomarkers for abdominal aortic aneurysm,2011,Adelina E Acosta-Martin and Alexandre Panchaud and Maggy Chwastyniak and Annabelle Dupont and Francis Juthier and Corinne Gautier and Brigitte Jude and Philippe Amouyel and David R Goodlett and Florence Pinet,6,PLoS One,12,e28698,Public Library of Science,Background Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterized by increased aortic vessel wall diameter (>1.5 times normal) and loss of parallelism. This disease is responsible for 1–4% mortality occurring on rupture in males older than 65 years. Due to its asymptomatic nature. proteomic techniques were used to search for diagnostic biomarkers that might allow surgical intervention under nonlife threatening conditions.   Methodology/Principal Findings Pooled human plasma samples of 17 AAA and 17 control patients were depleted of the most abundant proteins and compared using a data-independent shotgun proteomic strategy. Precursor Acquisition Independent From Ion Count (PAcIFIC). combined with spectral counting and isobaric tandem mass tags. Both quantitative methods collectively identified 80 proteins as statistically differentially abundant between AAA and control patients. Among differentially abundant proteins. a subgroup of 19 was selected according to Gene Ontology classification and implication in AAA for verification by Western blot (WB) in the same 34 individual plasma samples that comprised the pools. From the 19 proteins. 12 were detected by WB. Five of them were verified to be differentially up-regulated in individual plasma of AAA patients: adiponectin. extracellular superoxide dismutase. protein AMBP. kallistatin and carboxypeptidase B2.   Conclusions/Significance Plasma depletion of high abundance proteins combined with quantitative PAcIFIC analysis offered an efficient and sensitive tool for the screening of new potential biomarkers of AAA. However. WB analysis to verify the 19 PAcIFIC identified proteins of …,True,iExS8vMAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC,37,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028698,14434081938521282955,/scholar?cites=14434081938521282955,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028698,0,0,0

Iduronic acid domains in dermatan sulfate. which are formed by the action of two DS-epimerases. have a key role in mediating these functions. We have identified the catalytic site and three putative catalytic residues in DS-epimerase 1. His-205. Tyr-261. and His-450. by tertiary structure modeling and amino acid conservation to heparinase II. These residues were systematically mutated to alanine or more conserved residues. which resulted in complete loss of epimerase activity. Based on these data and the close relationship between lyase and epimerase reactions. we propose a model where His-450 functions as a general base abstracting the C5 proton from glucuronic acid. Subsequent cleavage of the glycosidic linkage by Tyr-261 generates a 4.5-unsaturated hexuronic intermediate. which …,True,iExS8vMAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC,37,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819821920,15158475715263475965,/scholar?cites=15158475715263475965,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819821920,0,0,0
