Our thesis is that constraint constructs and the optimization they induce play a pivotal role in mining queries. thus substantially enhancing the usefulness and performance of the mining system. This is based on the analogy of declarative query languages like SQL and query optimization which have made relational databases so successful. To this end. our proposed demo is not yet another data mining system. but of a new paradigm in data mining-mining with constraints. as the important first step towards supporting ad-hoc mining in DBMS.,True,Kv9AbjMAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C,46,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/304182.304575,10512040165302629246,/scholar?cites=10512040165302629246,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.53.8425&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

32765,Constructing topical hierarchies in heterogeneous information networks,2015,Chi Wang and Jialu Liu and Nihit Desai and Marina Danilevsky and Jiawei Han,44,Knowledge and Information Systems,3,529-558,Springer London,Many digital documentary data collections (e.g.. scientific publications. enterprise reports. news articles. and social media) can be modeled as a heterogeneous information network. linking text with multiple types of entities. Constructing high-quality hierarchies that can represent topics at multiple granularities benefits tasks such as search. information browsing. and pattern mining. In this work. we present an algorithm for recursively constructing multi-typed topical hierarchies. Contrary to traditional text-based topic modeling. our approach handles both textual phrases and multiple types of entities by a newly designed clustering and ranking algorithm for heterogeneous network data. as well as mining and ranking topical patterns of different types. Our experiments on datasets from two different domains demonstrate that our algorithm yields high-quality. multi-typed topical hierarchies.,True,Kv9AbjMAAAAJ:UX7E2m6xpKUC,45,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-014-0777-4,9288643477404365479,/scholar?cites=9288643477404365479,,http://shichuan.org/hin/topic/Clustering/2013.%20Constructing%20Topical%20Hierarchies%20in%20Heterogeneous%20Information%20Networks.pdf,0

32767,Community distribution outlier detection in heterogeneous information networks,2013,Manish Gupta and Jing Gao and Jiawei Han,,,,557-573,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Heterogeneous networks are ubiquitous. For example. bibliographic data. social data. medical records. movie data and many more can be modeled as heterogeneous networks. Rich information associated with multi-typed nodes in heterogeneous networks motivates us to propose a new definition of outliers. which is different from those defined for homogeneous networks. In this paper. we propose the novel concept of Community Distribution Outliers (CDOutliers) for heterogeneous information networks. which are defined as objects whose community distribution does not follow any of the popular community distribution patterns.We extract such outliers using a type-aware joint analysis of multiple types of objects. Given community membership matrices for all types of objects. we follow an iterative two-stage approach which performs pattern discovery and outlier detection in a tightly integrated manner.

32768,Shattering and compressing networks for betweenness centrality,2013,Ahmet Erdem Sariyüce and Erik Saule and Kamer Kaya and Ümit V Çatalyürek,,,,686-694,Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics,The betweenness metric has always been intriguing and used in many analyses. Yet. it is one of the most computationally expensive kernels in graph mining. For that reason. making betweenness centrality computations faster is an important and well-studied problem. In this work. we propose the framework. BADIOS. which compresses a network and shatters it into pieces so that the centrality computation can be handled independently for each piece. Although BADIOS is designed and tuned for betweenness centrality. it can easily be adapted for other centrality metrics. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques can be a great arsenal to reduce the centrality computation time for various types and sizes of networks. In particular. it reduces the computation time of a 4.6 million edges graph from more than 5 days to less than 16 hours.,True,Kv9AbjMAAAAJ:l2sC-qQILUoC,44,https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611972832.76,507748046348235563,/scholar?cites=507748046348235563,,http://sariyuce.com/papers/sdm13.pdf,0
32769,Dynamic social influence analysis through time-dependent factor graphs,2011,Chi Wang and Jie Tang and Jimeng Sun and Jiawei Han,,,,239-246,IEEE,"Social influence. the phenomenon that the actions of a user can induce her/his friends to behave in a similar way. plays a key role in many (online) social systems. For example. a company wants to market a new product through the effect of ""word of mouth'' in the social network. It wishes to find and convince a small number of influential users to adopt the product. and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions. Fundamentally. we need to answer the following question: how to quantify the influence between two users in a large social network?

32770,Continuous k-nearest neighbor search for moving objects,2004,Yifan Li and Jiong Yang and Jiawei Han,,,,123-126,IEEE,The paper describes a new method of continuously monitoring the k nearest neighbors of a given object in the mobile environment. Instead of monitoring all k nearest neighbors. we choose to monitor the k-th (nearest) neighbor since the necessary condition of changes in the KNN is the change of the k-th neighbor. In addition. rather than in the original space. we consider the moving objects in a transformed time-distance (TD) space. where each object is represented by a curve. A beach-line algorithm is developed to monitor the change of the k-th neighbor. which enables us to maintain the KNN incrementally. An extensive empirical study shows that the beach-line algorithm outperforms the most efficient existing algorithm by a wide margin. especially when k or n (the total number of objects) is large.,True,Kv9AbjMAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C,44,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1311202/,16173667413261521611,/scholar?cites=16173667413261521611,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.494.2510&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

This paper develops a method of compiling and optimizing complex function‐free linear recursions using a variable connection graph. the V‐graph. It shows that a function‐free recursion consisting of a linear recursive rule and one or more nonrecursive rules can be compiled to (1) a bounded recursion. in which recursion can be eliminated from the program. or (2) an n‐chain recursion. whose compiled formula consists of one chain. when n= 1. or n synchronized compiled chains. when n > 1.

Recently. deep neural models are gaining increasing popularity for text classification due to their expressive power and minimum requirement for feature engineering. However. applying deep neural networks for hierarchical text classification remains challenging. because they heavily rely on a large amount of training data and meanwhile cannot easily determine appropriate levels of documents in the hierarchical setting. In this paper. we propose a weakly-supervised neural method for hierarchical text classification. Our method does not require a large amount of training data but requires only easy-to-provide weak supervision signals such as a few class-related documents or keywords. Our method effectively leverages such weak supervision signals to generate pseudo documents for model pre-training. and then performs self-training on real unlabeled data to iteratively refine the model. During the training process. our model features a hierarchical neural structure. which mimics the given hierarchy and is capable of determining the proper levels for documents with a blocking mechanism.

The experimental tests were performed on a synthetic relational database built on top of WISS (Wisconsin Storage System) on VAX 11/750.

32794,On efficient processing of subspace skyline queries on high dimensional data,2007,Wen Jin and Anthony KH Tung and Martin Ester and Jiawei Han,,,,12-12,IEEE,Recent studies on efficiently answering subspace skyline queries can be separated into two approaches. The first focused on pre-materializing a set of skylines points in various subspaces while the second focus on dynamically answering the queries by using a set of anchors to prune off skyline points through spatial reasoning. Despite effort to compress the pre-materialized subspace skylines through removal of redundancy. the storage space for the first approach remain exponential in the number of dimensions. The query time for the second approach on the other hand also grow substantially for data with higher dimensionality where the pruning power of anchors become much weaker.

The relative processing efficiency of these algorithms are analyzed and compared based on different database structures and accessing methods. Our study shows that the δ-wavefront algorithm performs consistently better than the wavefront algorithm. and the level-relaxed δ-wavefront algorithm has high potential of further reducing I/O accessing cost on the databases with clustered derivation paths.

MA,In recent years. data streams have become ubiquitous because of the large number of applications which generate huge volumes of data in an automated way. Many existing data mining methods cannot be applied directly on data streams because of the fact that the data needs to be mined in one pass. Furthermore. data streams show a considerable amount of temporal locality because of which a direct application of the existing methods may lead to misleading results. In this paper. we develop an efficient and effective approach for mining fast evolving data streams. which integrates the micro-clustering technique with the high-level data mining process. and discovers data evolution regularities as well.

To compress the frequent patterns. we propose to cluster frequent patterns with a tightness measure δ (called δ-cluster). and select a representative pattern for each cluster. The problem of finding a minimum set of representative patterns is shown NP-Hard. We develop two greedy methods. RPglobal and RPlocal. The former has the guaranteed compression bound but higher computational complexity. The latter sacrifices the theoretical bounds but is far more efficient. Our performance study shows that the compression quality using RPlocal is very close to RPglobal. and both can reduce the number of closed frequent patterns by almost two orders of magnitude.

Heidelberg,The problem of extracting structured data (i.e. lists. record sets. tables. etc.) from the Web has been traditionally approached by taking into account either the underlying markup structure of a Web page or the visual structure of the Web page. However. empirical results show that considering the HTML structure and visual cues of a Web page independently do not generalize well. We propose a new hybrid method to extract general lists from the Web. It employs both general assumptions on the visual rendering of lists. and the structural representation of items contained in them. We show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods across a varied Web corpus.,True,Kv9AbjMAAAAJ:Hck25ST_3aIC,35,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21822-4_29,2602140494496359934,/scholar?cites=2602140494496359934,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donato_Malerba/publication/221049720_Extracting_General_Lists_from_Web_Documents_A_Hybrid_Approach/links/0a85e5339682c57300000000/Extracting-General-Lists-from-Web-Documents-A-Hybrid-Approach.pdf,0

32874,Resolving entity morphs in censored data,2013,Hongzhao Huang and Zhen Wen and Dian Yu and Heng Ji and Yizhou Sun and Jiawei Han and He Li,,,,1083-1093,,In some societies. internet users have to create information morphs (eg “Peace West King” to refer to “Bo Xilai”) to avoid active censorship or achieve other communication goals. In this paper we aim to solve a new problem of resolving entity morphs to their real targets.

This motivates us to study a problem as follows: given a label budget. how to select data points to label such that the learning performance is optimized. We propose a selective labeling method by analyzing the generalization error of Laplacian regularized Least Squares (LapRLS). In particular. we derive a deterministic generalization error bound for LapRLS trained on subsampled data. and propose to select a subset of data points to label by minimizing this upper bound.

Moreover. delivering all the sensory data to the sink would cost enormous energy. Therefore. although some classification techniques can deal with limited label information. they cannot be directly applied to sensor networks since they are designed for centralized databases. To address these challenges. we propose a hierarchical aggregate classification (HAC) protocol which can reduce the amount of data sent by each node while achieving accurate classification in the face of insufficient label information.

Such structure provides flexibility of understanding local information with different granularities. Moreover. the contextualized analysis derived from cube structure often yields comparative insights. To quickly digest the content of subsets of documents in the multi-dimensional context. we study the problem of phrase-based summarization of a subset of documents of interest. We propose a new phrase ranking measure to leverage the relation between document subsets induced by multi-dimensional context and identify phrases that truly distinguish the queried subset of documents from neighboring subsets (ie. background). Our quality evaluation suggests the new measure involving dynamic. query-dependent background generation is more effective than previous measures using the whole corpus as a static background for finding representative phrases. Computing this measure is more expensive due to the need of access to many subsets of documents to answer one query.

32919,Collective topic modeling for heterogeneous networks,2011,Hongbo Deng and Bo Zhao and Jiawei Han,,,,1109-1110,,In this paper. we propose a joint probabilistic topic model for simultaneously modeling the contents of multi-typed objects of a heterogeneous information network. The intuition behind our model is that different objects of the heterogeneous network share a common set of latent topics so as to adjust the multinomial distributions over topics for different objects collectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for the tasks of topic modeling and object clustering.,True,Kv9AbjMAAAAJ:IuzW4o0J_HAC,23,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2009916.2010073,5496669143285192497,/scholar?cites=5496669143285192497,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.220.2492&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

Most of them focus on ranking individual tuples from one table or joins of multiple tables containing a set of keywords. In this paper. we study the problem of keyword search in a data cube with text-rich dimension(s) (so-called text cube). The text cube is built on a multidimensional text database. where each row is associated with some text data (a document) and other structural dimensions (attributes). A cell in the text cube aggregates a set of documents with matching attribute values in a subset of dimensions. We define a keyword-based query language and an IR-style relevance model for scoring/ranking cells in the text cube. Given a keyword query. our goal is to find the top-k most relevant cells. We propose four approaches: inverted …,True,Kv9AbjMAAAAJ:2ywjKiB__4kC,23,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5710919/,8923021419641881828,/scholar?cites=8923021419641881828,,http://www.academia.edu/download/51268306/Efficient_Keyword-Based_Search_for_Top-K20170109-9415-13adoby.pdf,0

Heidelberg,Clustering analysis has been a very active area of research in the data mining community. However. most algorithms have ignored the fact that physical obstacles exist in the real world and could thus affect the result of clustering dramatically. In this paper. we will look at the problem of clustering in the presence of obstacles. We called this problem the COE (Clustering with Obstacles Entities) problem and provide an outline of an algorithm called COE-CLARANS to solve it.,True,Kv9AbjMAAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC,23,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45571-X_19,18396761512169005275,/scholar?cites=18396761512169005275,,,0

A technique is developed which compiles a functional linear recursion into chain or bounded forms and analyzes efficient processing of the compiled chains based on different kinds of constraints. It is shown that rule constraints should be compiled together with the rectified recursions; finiteness constraints and monotonicity constraints should be used in the analysis of finite evaluability and termination; and query constraints should be pushed into the compiled chains. when possible. for efficient set-oriented evaluation. Constraint-based processing can be enhanced by dynamic constraint enforcement in query evaluation. The method is illustrated using a typical traversal recursion problem. It is concluded that the principles developed are useful for a large set of …,True,Kv9AbjMAAAAJ:_5tno0g5mFcC,23,https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icde/1991/00131473/12OmNxzuMO5,18432089067653699095,/scholar?cites=18432089067653699095,,,0
32923,Towards faster rates and oracle property for low-rank matrix estimation,2016,Huan Gui and Jiawei Han and Quanquan Gu,,,,2300-2309,PMLR,We present a unified framework for low-rank matrix estimation with a nonconvex penalty. A proximal gradient homotopy algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed optimization problem. Theoretically. we first prove that the proposed estimator attains a faster statistical rate than the traditional low-rank matrix estimator with nuclear norm penalty. Moreover. we rigorously show that under a certain condition on the magnitude of the nonzero singular values. the proposed estimator enjoys oracle property (ie. exactly recovers the true rank of the matrix). besides attaining a faster rate. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings.,True,Kv9AbjMAAAAJ:Dg-NvihI0yoC,22,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/gui16.html,1850575521278024177,/scholar?cites=1850575521278024177,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/gui16.pdf,0
32924,Debiasing crowdsourced batches,2015,Honglei Zhuang and Aditya Parameswaran and Dan Roth and Jiawei Han,,,,1593-1602,,Crowdsourcing is the de-facto standard for gathering annotated data. While. in theory. data annotation tasks are assumed to be attempted by workers independently. in practice. data annotation tasks are often grouped into batches to be presented and annotated by workers together. in order to save on the time or cost overhead of providing instructions or necessary background. Thus. even though independence is usually assumed between annotations on data items within the same batch. in most cases. a worker's judgment on a data item can still be affected by other data items within the batch. leading to additional errors in collected labels. In this paper. we study the data annotation bias when data items are presented as batches to be judged by workers simultaneously. We propose a novel worker model to characterize the annotating behavior on data batches. and present how to train the worker model on …,True,Kv9AbjMAAAAJ:RaRNlNDkcy8C,22,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2783258.2783316,9204637160022806739,/scholar?cites=9204637160022806739,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4691348/,0
32925,Graph regularized meta-path based transductive regression in heterogeneous information network,2015,Mengting Wan and Yunbo Ouyang and Lance Kaplan and Jiawei Han,,,,918-926,Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics,A number of real-world networks are heterogeneous information networks. which are composed of different types of nodes and links. Numerical prediction in heterogeneous information networks is a challenging but significant area because network based information for unlabeled objects is usually limited to make precise estimations. In this paper. we consider a graph regularized meta-path based transductive regression model (Grempt). which combines the principal philosophies of typical graph-based transductive classification methods and transductive regression models designed for homogeneous networks. The computation of our method is time and space efficient and the precision of our model can be verified by numerical experiments.,True,Kv9AbjMAAAAJ:wTlTSBh5aqwC,22,https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611974010.103,1474806123464349443,/scholar?cites=1474806123464349443,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4688014/,0
32926,Sequential pattern mining,2014,Wei Shen and Jianyong Wang and Jiawei Han,,,,261-282,Springer. Cham,Sequential pattern mining. which discovers frequent subsequences as patterns in a sequence database. has been a focused theme in data mining research for over a decade. This problem has broad applications. such as mining customer purchase patterns and Web access patterns. However. it is also a challenging problem since the mining may have to generate or examine a combinatorially explosive number of intermediate subsequences. Abundant literature has been dedicated to this research and tremendous progress has been made so far.

32927,Quality of information based data selection and transmission in wireless sensor networks,2012,Lu Su and Shaohan Hu and Shen Li and Feng Liang and Jing Gao and Tarek F Abdelzaher and Jiawei Han,,,,327-338,IEEE,In this paper. we provide a quality of information (QoI) based data selection and transmission service for classification missions in sensor networks. We first identify the two aspects of QoI. data reliability and data redundancy. and then propose metrics to estimate them. In particular. reliability implies the degree to which a sensor node contributes to the classification mission. and can be estimated through exploring the agreement between this node and the majority of others. On the other hand. redundancy represents the information overlap among different sensor nodes. and can be measured via investigating the similarity of their clustering results. Based on the proposed QoI metrics. we formulate an optimization problem that aims at maximizing the reliability of sensory data while eliminating their redundancies under the constraint of network resources. We decompose this problem into a data selection sub problem …,True,Kv9AbjMAAAAJ:Q3-QASNKTMEC,22,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6424815/,14601752032515402909,/scholar?cites=14601752032515402909,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.301.9263&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0
