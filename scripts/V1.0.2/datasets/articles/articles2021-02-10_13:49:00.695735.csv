112033,Pore-forming protein toxins: from structure to function,2005,Michael W Parker and Susanne C Feil,88,,1,91-142,Pergamon,Pore-forming protein toxins (PFTs) are one of Nature's most potent biological weapons. An essential feature of their toxicity is the remarkable property that PFTs can exist either in a stable water-soluble state or as an integral membrane pore. In order to convert from the water-soluble to the membrane state. the toxin must undergo large conformational changes. There are now more than a dozen PFTs for which crystal structures have been determined and the nature of the conformational changes they must undergo is beginning to be understood. Although they differ markedly in their primary. secondary. tertiary and quaternary structures. nearly all can be classified into one of two families based on the types of pores they are thought to form: α-PFTs or β-PFTs.

This inhibitory structure is called a pseudosubstrate and specific regulators are required to remove it from the active site to allow substrates access. Removal of the pseudosubstrate sequence from members of the myosin light-chain kinase subfamily 1. including twitchin kinase. activates them but it is not known whether the pseudosubstrate sequence binds to the active site. Native twitchin is a 753K protein (6.839 residues) located in muscle A-bands of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans 3. 4 and because of its size has not been easy to study.

While this residue appears to be conserved in many Theta-class GSTs. its absence in some suggested that the Theta-class GSTs may have a significantly different structure or catalytic mechanism. The elucidation of the crystal structure of the Theta-class GST from the Australian sheep blowfly. Lucilia cuprina. has indicated that a serine residue rather than a tyrosine residue can form a hydrogen bond with the glutathionyl sulphur atom. The present studies show that mutation of Ser-9 to alanine substantially inactivates the L. cuprina GST. confirming its importance in the reaction mechanism. As this serine is conserved in all Theta-class enzymes reported so far. it seems that an active-site serine is a significant factor that distinguishes …,True,ZrUEdmcAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,152,https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article/311/1/247/31923,2200828972567062735,/scholar?cites=2200828972567062735,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1136145/pdf/biochemj00054-0241.pdf,0,0,0

We have determined the crystal structure of the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of murine Siah1a to 2.6 Å resolution. The structure reveals that Siah is a dimeric protein and that the SBD adopts an eight-stranded β-sandwich fold that is highly similar to the TRAF-C region of TRAF (TNF-receptor associated factor) proteins. The TRAF-C region interacts with TNF-α receptors and TNF-receptor associated death-domain (TRADD) proteins; however. our findings indicate that these interactions are unlikely to be mimicked by Siah.

The high genetic variability of HCV and the rapid development of drug-resistant strains are driving the urgent search for new direct-acting antiviral agents. A new class of agents has recently been developed that are believed to target the HCV protein NS5A although precisely where they interact and how they affect function is unknown. Here we describe an in vitro assay based on microscale thermophoresis and demonstrate that two clinically relevant inhibitors bind tightly to NS5A domain 1 and inhibit RNA binding. Conversely. RNA binding inhibits compound binding. The compounds bind more weakly to known resistance mutants L31V and Y93H. The compounds do not affect NS5A dimerisation.

In the presence of ethacrynic acid. the enzyme follows a rapid equilibrium random bi−bi mechanism with a rate-limiting step which occurs after the addition of the substrates and before the release of products. The replacement of Tyr 108 with Phe yields a 14-fold decrease of kcat. while it does not change appreciably the affinity of the H site for the substrate.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in the development of the disease. through the generation of a peptide called Aβ by proteolysis of the precursor protein. APP can function as a metalloprotein and modulate copper transport via its extracellular copper binding domain (CuBD). Copper binding to this domain has been shown to reduce Aβ levels and hence a molecular understanding of the interaction between metal and protein could lead to the development of novel therapeutics to treat the disease. We have recently determined the three-dimensional structures of apo and copper bound forms of CuBD. The structures provide a mechanism by which CuBD could readily transfer copper ions to other proteins.

Many frog species produce amphipathic α-helical peptides with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity in the skin but their therapeutic potential is limited by varying degrees of cytolytic activity towards eukaryotic cells. Methods for development of such peptides into anti-infective drugs are illustrated by the example of temporin-1DRa (HFLGTLVNLAK KIL.NH2).

Xenopus laevis. Since that time more than 200 such peptides have been isolated from the skins of other frogs belonging to different families. With very few exceptions. the frog skin antimicrobial peptides are cationic. relatively hydrophobic and have the propensity to form an amphipathic α-helix in a membrane-mimetic environment. By making selective changes to the molecular charge. hydrophobicity and secondary structure of the naturally occurring peptides. analogues have been developed that show increased potency against microorganisms but reduced toxicity towards mammalian cells.

Ltd,Our group recently described recurrent somatic mutations of the miRNA processing gene DICER1 in non‐epithelial ovarian cancer. Mutations appeared to be clustered around each of four critical metal‐binding residues in the RNase IIIB domain of DICER1. This domain is responsible for cleavage of the 3′ end of the 5p miRNA strand of a pre‐mRNA hairpin. To investigate the effects of these cancer‐associated 'hotspot' mutations. we engineered mouse DICER1‐deficient ES cells to express wild‐type and an allelic series of the mutant DICER1 variants. Global miRNA and mRNA profiles from cells carrying the metal‐binding site mutations were compared to each other and to wild‐type DICER1.

All the strains have variable numbers of a tandemly repeated DNA sequence. 31 bp to 53 bp in size. at their mtDNA termini. Based upon the size and nucleotide sequence of the terminal repeats. the telomeres can be separated into four classes. T. pigmentosa. hyperangularis. and hegewischi have different telomeric repeats on the two ends of their mtDNAs. The only conserved feature of the mtDNA termini is the presence of tandem repeats.

The mtDNA telomeres consist of a 53 bp sequence tandemly repeated from 4 to 30 times. with most molecules having 15 ± 4 repetitions.

In the Creator system. an ORF introduced into a donor vector can be transferred with Cre recombinase to a library of acceptor vectors optimized for different applications. Usability of the Creator system is impacted by the ability to easily manipulate DNA. the number of acceptor vectors for downstream applications. and the level of protein expression from Creator vectors. To date. we have developed over 20 novel acceptor vectors that employ a variety of promoters and epitope tags commonly employed for proteomics applications and gene function analysis. We also made several enhancements to the donor vectors including addition of different multiple cloning sites to allow shuttling from pre-existing vectors and introduction of the lacZ alpha reporter gene to allow for selection. Importantly. in order to ameliorate any effects on protein expression of the loxP site between a 5' tag and ORF. we introduced a splicing event into our expression vectors.

It has long been known that normal human cells have a finite lifespan when placed in cell culture. and their lifespan is dependent on the age of the individual donor. The mechanism of the genetic program that times this process has been elusive. The telomere hypothesis of cell aging proposes that the length of the telomeric repeat array at chromosomal termini can time replication number and signal cell cycle arrest when critical telomere lengths are obtained.

Design: We generated a prototype human microarray design and used it to profile alternative isoforms expressed in RNA samples extracted from 5-FU sensitive and resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. To assess the performance of our approach. we profiled the same RNAs with Affymetrix Human Exon arrays and compared the results between platforms. Methods: Creation of ALEXA arrays involved extracting. scoring. filtering and annotating oligonucleotide probes that corresponded to the exons. introns. exon boundaries and exonexon junctions of EnsEMBL genes. Prototype arrays created with the ALEXA platform were synthesized by NimbleGen. RNA samples were isolated in triplicate from colorectal cancer cell lines and profiled on the NimbleGen and Affymetrix array platforms according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting data were analyzed to identify isoforms differentially expressed between 5-FU sensitive and resistant samples.

Tpt1 depletion caused a rapid growth arrest and telomere elongation in the absence of cell division. The phenotype was similar to that seen after Pot1a depletion suggesting that Tpt1 and Pot1a function together to regulate telomere length and prevent telomere deprotection. In contrast.

The mtDNA has a multimodal distribution of telomeres. Different groups in the distribution have different numbers of telomeric repeats. The standard deviation of the size of each end group is independent of the mean size of the end group. The two sides of the mtDNA have different multimodal distributions of repeats. Cloned cell lines have multimodal distributions of mtDNA telomeres distinct from that of the original cell line. The number of telomere end groups and the average size of the end groups change in an erratic fashion as the cells are passaged and do not reach a stable equilibrium distribution in 185 generations. We propose that the mean size of a telomere end group and the size distribution of an end group are independently regulated.

CIC alterations and/or loss of CIC activity have been associated with poorer outcomes and more aggressive phenotypes across cancer types. which is consistent with the notion that CIC functions as a tumour suppressor across a wide range of contexts.Using mammalian cells lacking functional CIC. we found that CIC deficiency was associated with chromosome segregation (CS) defects. resulting in chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. These CS defects were associated with transcriptional dysregulation of spindle assembly checkpoint and cell cycle regulators. We also identified novel CIC interacting proteins. including core members of the SWI/SNF complex. and showed that they cooperatively regulated the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation. Finally. we showed that loss of CIC and ARID1A cooperatively increased CS defects and reduced cell viability.Our study ascribes a novel role to CIC as an important regulator of the cell cycle and demonstrates that loss of CIC can lead to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy in human and murine cells through defects in CS. providing insight into the underlying mechanisms of CIC’s increasingly apparent role as a “pan-cancer” tumour suppressor.,True,tqrzIQgAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC,2,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/533323v1.abstract,5886259011721729563,/scholar?cites=5886259011721729563,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/01/29/533323.full.pdf,0,0,0

In particular. they have demonstrated that PP2A is functionally inactivated in blast crisis (BC) CML. the late stage of CML. through the inhibitory activity of the BCR-ABL–regulated SET protein (2). They have explored SET-sequestering and PP2A-interacting activating drugs as potential therapeutics in CML (3). In our study. we have clearly acknowledged the importance of PP2A and its network in regulating multiple biological processes in cancer development and progression. including CML (4). We highlighted the complexity of PP2A’s structure and its multiple substrates that can either negatively or positively regulate numerous signaling cascades involved in proliferation. cell cycle control. adhesion/migration. etc. Its activity can also be moderated by posttranslational modifications. multiple protein-protein interactions. and altered subcellular localization. which make its roles even more complicated.

SCCOHT tumors have inactivating mutations in SMARCA4 (BRG1). one of the two mutually exclusive ATPases of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. To address the role that BRG1 loss plays in SCCOHT tumorigenesis. we performed integrative multi-omic analyses in SCCOHT cell lines +/- BRG1 reexpression. BRG1 reexpression induced a gene and protein signature similar to an epithelial cell and gained chromatin accessibility sites correlated with other epithelial originating TCGA tumors. Gained chromatin accessibility and BRG1 recruited sites were strongly enriched for transcription-factor-binding motifs of AP-1 family members. Furthermore. AP-1 motifs were enriched at the promoters of highly upregulated epithelial genes. Using a dominant-negative AP-1 cell line. we found that both AP-1 DNA-binding activity and BRG1 reexpression are necessary for the gene and protein expression of epithelial genes. Our study demonstrates that BRG1 reexpression drives an epithelial-like gene and protein signature in SCCOHT cells that depends upon by AP-1 activity.,True,tqrzIQgAAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC,0,https://elifesciences.org/articles/59073,,,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/59073.pdf,0,0,0

The most rapid and dramatic changes were found in a form of NR which was sensitive to inhibition by millimolar concentrations of magnesium. This form of NR predominated in leaves in the dark. but was almost completely absent from leaves incubated in the light for only 30 min. When the leaves were returned to darkness. the NR rapidly became sensitive to Mg2+ inhibition. Modulation of the overall reaction involving NADH as electron donor was also found when reduced methyl viologen was the donor (MV:NR). indicating that electron transfer had been blocked. at least in part. at or near the terminal molybdenum cofactor site.

112348,Posttranslational regulation of nitrate reductase in higher plants.,1994,Werner M Kaiser and Steven C Huber,106,Plant Physiology,3,817,American Society of Plant Biologists,In many plants. nitrogen represents 2 to 6% of dry matter. most of it being present in the form of amino acids. proteins. or nucleic acids. In these organic compounds. nitrogen exists in its most reduced state (oxidation state-3). It is taken up from the soil primarily in the form of nitrate (oxidation state+ 5). Thus. nitrate has to be reduced by plants at the expense of reductants such as NADH or NADPH. requiring 8 mo1 of electrons [or 4 mo1 of NAD (P) H] per mo1 of nitrate. Reduction is a two-step mechanism. The first step. reduction of nitrate to nitrite (+ 3 oxidation state). is catalyzed by assimilatory NR. which is an NAD (P) H-dependent cytosolic enzyme. Nitrite is further reduced to ammonia (-3 oxidation state) in the plastids of leaves or roots by NiR. There are at least two important reasons why plants must exert control on the velocity of nitrate reduction. First. it is an energy-consuming process.

112354,Control of photosynthetic sucrose formation,1987,MARK STITT and STEVE HUBER and PHIL KERR,,,,327-409,Academic Press,This chapter discusses the control of photosynthetic sucrose formation. In most species. starch and sucrose are the principal end products of photosynthesis. It is clear that the formation of both carbohydrates is highly regulated biochemically. The interdependence of chloroplast and cytosolic metabolism implies that coordination of the fluxes and conditions in these compartments is a precondition for rapid photosynthesis. This interaction is defined by the stoichiometry of carbon and phosphate flow during steady-state photosynthesis. Chloroplasts convert three CO2 and one Pi to one molecule of triose-P. and a continuation of photosynthesis depends on the triose-P being removed and more Pi becoming available. This is achieved by exporting triose-P from the chloroplast. in exchange for Pi. However. the rate of this exchange must be coordinated with the rate of CO2 fixation. because only one …,True,yISZlqAAAAAJ:MhiOAD_qIWkC,216,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780126754100500129,10583407602633029790,/scholar?cites=10583407602633029790,,,0,0,0

The 14‐3‐3‐dependent inactivation of phospho‐NR is known to require millimolar concentrations of a divalent cation such as Mg2+ at pH 7.5. We now report that micromolar concentrations of the polyamines. spermidine4+ and spermine3+. can substitute for divalent cations in modulating 14‐3‐3 action.

To identify sites within NR protein that play a role in this post-translational regulation. a heterologous expression system and an in vitro inactivation assay for Arabidopsis NR were developed. Protein extracts containing NR kinases and inhibitor proteins were prepared from an NR-defective mutant that had lesions in both the NIA1 and NIA2 NR genes of Arabidopsis. Active NR protein was produced in a Pichia pastoris expression system. Incubation of these two preparations resulted in a Mg-ATP-dependent inactivation of NR that was reversed with EDTA.

Rapidly growing and fully heterotrophic cells in the basal part of the young leaf showed a high sucrose synthase (SS) activity. Leaf SS has been purified to homogeneity. By comparison with purified kernel SS isozymes. the leaf SS has been identified as SS2. SS1 protein and SS2 protein were clearly separated by electrophoresis and the two monomers differed in size by 6 kilodaltons. Nevertheless. kinetic parameters of both enzymes were very similar. Immunodetection of SS protein showed that in young heterotrophic tissues SS2 was a major protein accounting for 3% of the total protein. Concurrent with greening.

The influence of canopy photosynthesis on sucrose' accumulation within muskmelon fruit mesocarp was examined. Canopy photosynthetic activities were estimated in a sweet and a nonsweet genotype. Photosynthetic rate of the nonsweet genotype. on a per-plant basis. was only 56% of that of the sweet genotype. The effect of limiting leaf area of the sweet genotype on carbohydrate concentrations and sucrose metabolizing enzymes within the fruit was evaluated. A 50% reduction of leaf area 8 days before initiation of fruit sucrose accumulation resulted in canopy photosynthesis similar to that of the nonsweet genotype. Reduced photosynthetic activity resulted in slightly lower soluble-carbohydrate concentration in the fruit; however. fruit sucrose concentration was three times higher than that reported previously for the nonsweet genotype. The extent to which `fruit sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activity increased during maturation was diminished by leaf removal. Acid invertase activity declined in all fruit in a similar manner irrespective of defoliation. A reduction of leaf area of a sweet genotype reduced sucrose accumulation within the fruit. Lower fruit sucrose concentration was associated with lower concentration of raffinose saccharides and lower SPS activity within the fruit.

Influence of proline and basic amino acid residues at selected positions,2001,Jian-Zhong Huang and Steven C Huber,42,Plant and Cell Physiology,10,1079-1087,Oxford University Press,Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaf sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) can be inactivated by phosphorylation of Ser-158 by calmodulin-like domain protein kinases (CDPKs) or SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRK1) in vitro. While the phosphorylation site sequence is relatively conserved. most of the deduced sequences of SPS from dicot species surrounding the Ser-158 regulatory phosphorylation site contain a Pro residue at P–4 (where P is the phosphorylated Ser); spinach is the exception and contains an Arg at P–4. We show that a Pro at P–4 selectively inhibits phosphorylation of the peptide by a CDPK relative to a SnRK1. The presence of a Pro at P–4. by allowing a tight turn in the peptide substrate. may interfere with proper binding of residues at P–5 and beyond.

Supplying exogenous inorganic phosphate (Pi) with mannose reduced sequestration of cellular Pi (as evidenced by mannose-6-P accumulation without depletion of hexose-P) and substantially reduced mannose activation of SPS.

Characterization of the pyruvate carrier,1977,Steven C Huber and Gerald E Edwards,462,Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)-Bioenergetics,3,583-602,Elsevier,1. Evidence is presented for high rates of carrier-mediated uptake of pyruvate into the stroma of intact mesophyll chloroplasts of the C4 plant Digitaria sanguinalis. but not the chloroplasts of the C3 plant Spinacea oleracea. Uptake of pyruvate in the dark with the C4 mesophyll chloroplasts was followed using two techniques: uptake of [14C]pyruvate as determined by silicon oil centrifugal filtration and uptake as indicated by absorbance changes at 535 nm (shrinkage/swelling) after addition of 0.1 M pyruvate salts.2. Uptake of the pyruvate anion by an electrogenic carrier is suggested to be the major mode of transport. Chloroplast swelling was observed in potassium pyruvate plus valinomycin and uptake of [14C]pyruvate was inhibited by membrane-permeant anions. Valinomycin reduced uptake in the absence of external potassium and the inhibition could be reversed by addition of external potassium.3.

This reaction product coordinates to three Mg2+ ions near the mouth of the active site cleft. A comparison of the liganded and unliganded structures reveals a ligand-induced conformational change that closes the mouth of the active site cleft.

Both an increase in reactive oxygen species production and a decrease in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability contribute to the endothelial dysfunction that underlies this vascular stiffness. independent of other age-related vascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis. The activation/upregulation of arginase appears to be an important contributor to age-related endothelial dysfunction by a mechanism that involves substrate (l-arginine) limitation for NO synthase (NOS) 3 and therefore NO synthesis. Not only does this lead to impaired NO production but also it contributes to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species by NOS.

The flux of substrate through this step is considerable. since the average adult excretes about 10 kg of urea per year. In addition to its presence in liver. arginase activity has been detected in a number of extrahepatic tissues that lack a complete urea cycle. such as lactating mammary gland [2. 3]. kidney [4–7). prostate [6]. and activated macrophages [5]. In most of these tissues. the arginase present represents a second isozyme (arginase II) that is distinct in immunological properties. amino acid sequence. and subcellular location from the more abundant liver isozyme (arginase I). The biological function of arginase II has been the subject of considerable interest; current thinking is that this isozyme provides a supply of L-ornithine for proline and polyamine biosynthesis. and along with arginase I it also serves to regulate the levels of L-arginine available for nitric oxide production. The comparative properties of the two arginase isozymes are discussed in a number of recent reviews [8–10]. Arginase I is the more abundant isozyme of the two. and it has been extensively characterized in terms of its biochemistry. enzymology. and three-dimensional structure.

As free Chtr is stable both to self-digestion and to digestion by HNE. these results are indicative of a stability and/or conformational change in Chtr that accompanies complex formation. As determined by both N-terminal sequence analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS). the major initial sites of HNE cleavage of complexed Chtr are between γ-chain residues A158/S159 and V188/S189. Significantly. this latter site is at the base of the S1 site that recognizes the P1 position of the serpin. A slower cleavage in the β-chain between T139/G140 is also found.

Understanding how these are encoded in amino-acid sequences is complicated by energetically unfavourable non-ideal features—for example kinked α-helices. bulged β-strands. strained loops and buried polar groups—that arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological function or from neutral drift. Here we describe an approach to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns to protein tertiary motifs. which make possible the design of funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into the target folded state.

To elucidate the mode of RNA binding. we introduced single alanine replacements into the NS1 RNA-binding domain at specific positions in the three-dimensional structure.

Today. typical sets of conformational constraints for protein structures consist of a large number of NOE constraints and a small number of dihedral angle constraints on C# J and x’obtained from homonuclear proton-proton coupling constants. The resultant structures show well-defined overall polypeptide folds. However. local backbone structures are not determined as precisely as may be possible with additional data. Furthermore. many side chains are less well defined than the backbone. While amino acid side chains may often adopt multiple conformations. there are no good approaches for characterizing their distributions in proteins.Measurements of heteronuclear coupling constants would provide a whole new class of constraints that could significantly improve protein structures at the local level. where improvement is needed most. The most promising approach is to measure “N-‘H vicinal coupling constants. This would lead to the following achievements.(i) Measurements of the coupling constants between the peptide nitrogen and the P-protons. combined with measurements of homonuclear coupling constants between CY-and P-protons. can provide a characterization of the side-chain dihedral angle x1 and stereospecific assignments of@-methylene protons.

Two kinds of ‘crankshaft motions’ of the polypeptide backbone are observed in this MD trajectory. The first involves small-amplitude rocking of the rigid peptide bond due to correlated changes in the backbone dihedral angles ψi−1 and φi. These high-frequency ‘librational crankshaft’ motions are correlated with systematically smaller values of motional order parameters for backbone N−H bond vectors compared to Cα−H bond vectors. In addition. infrequent ‘crankshaft flips’ of the peptide bond from one local minimum to another are observed for several amino acid residues. These MD simulations demonstrate that comparisons of N−H and Cα−H order parameters provide a useful approach for identifying crank …,True,mrtpF44AAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,68,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00211787.pdf,11829671606133249303,/scholar?cites=11829671606133249303,,,0,0,0

The mobilization was performed in different ways. for instance electrophoretically by exchanging the anolyte for the catholyte or vice versa. In this paper we treat the electrophoretic mobilization theoretically. originating from the conditions of electroneutrality. The information thus gained was used to design anolytes and catholytes of appropriate compositions for mobilization of focused proteins. The usefulness of these electrode solutions is illustrated by focusing-mobilization experiments performed in free solution in a glass tube of length 110 mm. Since the inside diameter of the tube and its wall thickness were only 0.05 mm. the Joule heat was efficiently removed. which allowed the use of high field strengths (270 V/cm).

The genetic variations in different populations increase the number of combinations of the different forms of transferrin. To resolve the many components in transferrin preparations. the new high performance capillary technique was employed for isoelectric focusing. Iron‐free transferrin and transferrin samples of known iron content were examined.

Using this definition. we found a large number of strains isolated from various infections to be very hydrophobic: 123 of 135 strains from patients with septicemia (91%). 54 of 60 strains from wound infections (90%). and 12 of 14 strains from urinary tract infections (86%).

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Capillary electrophoresis in conventional buffers and in 50 μ capillaries permits field strengths as high as 300–500 V/cm with acceptably low thermal zone deformation. However. still higher field strengths (up to at least 2000 V/cm) can be applied without a decrease in resolution if the experiments are performed in the buffers described in this paper. Characteristic of these buffers is their low electrical conductivity and yet satisfactory buffering capacity accomplished either (i) by selecting buffer constituents of relatively high molecular weight and small net charge or (ii) by fractionation of carrier ampholytes (originally introduced for isoelectric focusing experiments) into a series of narrow pH range fractions and using these fractions as buffers. or (iii) by selecting an ampholyte with two acidic groups and one basic group (or one acidic group and two basic groups) and with a pI value close to two of its pK values.

In most of these methods the sample is depleted (partially) of strong electrolytes concomitantly with the concentration. The methods are based on the fact that electrophoretic migration velocities decrease upon decreasing the absolute value of the zeta potential of a solute and the pore size of the electrophoresis medium and upon increasing the cross section of the electrophoresis chamber. the viscosity and the electrical conductivity of the electrophoresis medium. We have also utilized the zone-sharpening properties of displacement electrophoresis in combination with a hydrodynamic counter flow to create a stationary zone where the sample solutes can be collected continuously.In practice. the whole electrophoresis tube is filled with the sample solution to be concentrated.

Recent studies on different pathogens such as the gonococci and enterotoxigenic Escheriehia coli indicate that specific surface structures are involved in these interactions [1. 2]. Ultrastructural studies comparing M proteinpositive (M+) and M protein-negative (M-) strains of Streptococcus pyogenes suggest that both M protein and other surface structures such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) could be important in binding of bacteria to host cells [3-5]. Recent data on several bacterial pathogens indicate that different surface antigens confer hydrophobic characteristics which are probably important for cell to cell interactions through displacement of ordered water molecules located at the interacting surfaces attending formation of adhesive bonds [6].

When active transport can be neglected the equation might also give a qualitative picture of the factors that determine the distribution of solutes between the internal space of a living cell and its surroundings. Introduction of a series of assumptions. which are all discussed. leads to simplified formulae (eqns. 14 and 15). which. in spite of their approximate nature. seem to be applicable in most experiments.

Uppsala University. Several methods for on-and off-tube concentration of solutes have been developed. These methods also permit desalting of the sample. which is necessary for the creation of narrow starting zones in zone electrophoresis and to reduce the risk of precipitation and narrowing of the separation window in isoelectric focusing (IEF). A unique method designed particularly for desalting of samples for IEF is also discussed. To obtain high resolution the adsorption of solutes to the capillary wall must be eliminated. A pH stable. hydrophilic polymer coating has. therefore. been developed. Although polymer solutions give lower resolution than do gels they are often used as molecular-sieving media because they are replaceable and thus permit repetitive automated analyses in the same capillary. We have shown that low-melting methoxylated agarose gels are also replaceable and give the same high resolution as do polyacrylamide and dextran gels. Following an electrophoresis the methoxylated agarose gels can be displaced in the stationary capillary past the detection window. This scanning technique has several advantages. A capillary with strong electroendosmosis permits. in principle. separation of both acidic and basic proteins in one run. However. depending on whether the capillary wall is negatively or positively charged either the basic or the acidic proteins most often migrate with strong tailing caused by the electrostatic interaction with the capillary wall.

The M+ strain had a more hydrophobic and a more negatively charged surface than the M- strain. When the M+ strain was cultivated in the presence of sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics. its hydrophobicity either decreased or did not change. The M+ organisms adhered to pharyngeal epithelial cells more avidly than M+; however. cultivation of both strains with sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of penicillin and rifampin led to the decrease in adhesion.

KaiA. KaiB. and KaiC are essential proteins for the generation of a circadian rhythm. KaiC is proposed as a negative regulator of the circadian expression of all genes in the genome. and its phosphorylation is regulated positively by KaiA and negatively by KaiB and shows a circadian rhythm in vivo. To study the functions of KaiC phosphorylation in the circadian clock system. we identified two autophosphorylation sites. Ser-431 and Thr-432. by using mass spectrometry (MS). We generated Synechococcus mutants in which these residues were substituted for alanine by using site-directed mutagenesis. Phosphorylation of KaiC was reduced in the single mutants and was completely abolished in the double mutant. indicating that KaiC is also phosphorylated at these sites in vivo.

The γ subunit of retinal transducin (Tα/Tβγ) is selectively farnesylated. and the farnesylation is required for light signaling mediated by transducin in rod cells. However. whether and how this selective isoprenylation regulates cellular functions remain poorly understood. Here we report that knockin mice expressing geranylgeranylated Tγ showed normal rod responses to dim flashes under dark-adapted conditions but exhibited impaired properties in light adaptation. Of note. geranylgeranylation of Tγ suppressed light-induced transition of Tβγ from membrane to cytosol. and also attenuated its light-dependent translocation from the outer segment to the inner region. an event contributing to retinal light adaptation.

112849,Loops. linkages. rings. catenanes. cages. and crowders: entropy-based strategies for stabilizing proteins,2004,Huan-Xiang Zhou,37,,2,123-130,American Chemical Society,A protein molecule exists in either a compact folded state or a variable and open unfolded state. Since the unfolded state is favored by chain entropy. restricting its entropy is an attractive mechanism for shifting the equilibrium toward the folded state. A number of entropy-based strategies have been engineered or used by natural proteins to increase the folding stability:  (a) shortening of loop lengths. (b) covalent linkage of dimeric proteins. (c) backbone cyclization. (d) catenation. (e) spatial confinement. and (f) macromolecular crowding. Theoretical analyses demonstrate the importance of accounting for consequences on the folded as well as the unfolded state and provide guidance for further exploitation of these stabilization strategies. ,True,H4qd72AAAAAJ:HfY9tUF4VgMC,145,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar0302282,7655147750256994404,/scholar?cites=7655147750256994404,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.542.3473&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

However. methods have yet to be developed to decontaminate the environment from residues of pesticides. Pesticidal degradative genes in microbes have been found to be located on plasmids. transposons. and/or on chromosomes. Recent studies have provided clues to the evolution of degradative pathways and the organization of catabolic genes. thus making it much easier to develop genetically engineered microbes for the purpose of decontamination.Genetic manipulation offers a way of engineering microorganisms to deal with a pollutant. including pesticides that may be present in the contaminated sites.

This paper presents a mathematical model for correlating the interactions of some drilling control parameters such as speed. feed rate and drill diameter and their effects on some responses such as axial force and torque acting on the cutting tool during drilling by means of response surface methodology. For this exercise. a three-level full factorial design was chosen for experimentation using a PC-based computer numerically controlled drilling machine built in-house.

112876,Quantum corrections to classical time-correlation functions: Hydrogen bonding and anharmonic floppy modes,2004,Padma Kumar and Dominik Marx,121,J. Chem. Phys,,9,,Fluxional or floppy molecules are characterized by largeamplitude motion on strongly anharmonic potential energy landscapes including many nonseparable degrees of freedom which results in ‘‘floppy modes.’’1. 2 Typical examples are molecules such as. eg. protonated methane CH5 Ref. 3 and acetylene C2H3 Ref. 4 or the microsolvated clusters OH•(H2O) n Refs. 5 and 6 including the famous Zundel H5O2. 6. 7 and Eigen H3O•(H2O) 3 Ref. 8 proton-water complexes in the gas phase. Here. infrared IR spectroscopy is currently the prime experimental technique in order to probe their complex dynamics. which cannot be analyzed and thus understood in terms of harmonic frequencies; 1. 2 Coulomb explosion imaging is a much more recently developed real-space approach. see. eg. Refs. 9. 10 and work cited therein for such investigations. Another important class are hydrogen-bonded systems where the donor-acceptor distance. or hydrogen bond length. couples strongly to the proton motion within the hydrogen bond. 11 At large donor/acceptor separations. the proton moves in a double-well potential with a pronounced barrier. eg. in the protonated water dimer H2OHOH2 when stretched far beyond the equilibrium distance. At short donor/acceptor distances a single-well potential is stabilized. where the proton resides preferentially midway between the two oxygens. leading to ‘‘centered’’hydrogen bonds. Most interesting is the so-called ‘‘low-barrier hydrogen bond’’regime6 which is characterized by a shallow barrier such that small variations in the donor/acceptor distance result in significant changes of the dynamics and thus of the IR spectra …,True,H4qd72AAAAAJ:ybfzIt2tCtgC,67,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Padmanabhan_Kumar/publication/8379335_Quantum_corrections_to_classical_time-correlation_functions_Hydrogen_bonding_and_anharmonic_floppy_modes/links/57d3a85c08ae0c0081e27afc.pdf,10433257873442041087,/scholar?cites=10433257873442041087,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Padmanabhan_Kumar/publication/8379335_Quantum_corrections_to_classical_time-correlation_functions_Hydrogen_bonding_and_anharmonic_floppy_modes/links/57d3a85c08ae0c0081e27afc.pdf,0,0,0

The [7/5-C5 (CH3) 5] 3Co3B4H4 molecule is. to our knowledge. the only structurally characterized species con-taining three mutually bonded M [7j5-C5 (CH3) 5] groups. As we note in the Introduction. prior to the crystal structure determination it was questionable whether such an arrange-ment would be viable. given the unavoidably severe interligand steric crowding. The fact that this structure is nonetheless adopted even at the expense of cobalt-cobalt bond lengthening and considerable bending of the methyl groups out of the C5 ring planes implies strong thermodynamic preference for this particular cluster geometry as opposed to other. less sterically crowded arrangements.

Adiponectin is known to possess anti-fibrotic properties; however a high physiological concentration and multiple forms circulating in blood prohibit clinical use. Recently. an adiponectin-like small synthetic peptide agonist (ADP355: H-DAsn-Ile-Pro-Nva-Leu-Tyr-DSer-Phe-Ala-DSer-NH2) was synthesized for the treatment of murine breast cancer. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of ADP355 as an anti-fibrotic agent in the in vivo carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis model. Liver fibrosis was induced in eight-week old male C57BL/6J mice by CCl4-gavage every other day for four weeks before injection of a nanoparticle-conjugated with ADP355 (nano-ADP355). Control gold nanoparticles and nano-ADP355 were administered by intraperitoneal injection for two weeks along with CCl4-gavage. All mice were sacrificed after 6 weeks. and serum and liver tissue were collected for biochemical. histopathologic and molecular analyses. Biochemical studies suggested ADP355 treatment attenuates liver fibrosis. determined by reduction of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST). alanine aminotransferase ALT) and hydroxyproline.

The successful 1978 Oxford Symposium on nonlinear (soliton) struc ture and dynamics in condensed matter (Springer Ser. Solid-State Sci.. Vol. 8) was held at a time when the ubiquity of solitons was just begin ning to be appreciated by the condensed matter community; in subsequent years the soliton paradigm has provided a rather useful framework for in vestigating a large number of phenomena. particularly in low-dimensional systems. Nevertheless. we felt that the importance of nonlinearity in wider arenas than"" solitonics"" merited a significant expansion in the scope of the conference over that of the 1978 symposium. Indeed. many of the lessons are quite general and their potential for cross-fertilization of otherwise poorly connected disciplines was certainly one of the prime motivations for this conference.

Hence. an approximate response surface method (RSM) is utilized to analyze the effects of design and operating parameters on the vibration signature of a rotor-bearing system. This paper focuses on accurate performance prediction. which is essential to the design of high performance rotor bearing system. It considers distributed defects such as internal radial clearance and surface waviness of the bearing components. In the mathematical formulation the contacts between the rolling elements and the races are considered as nonlinear springs. whose stiffnesses are obtained by using Hertzian elastic contact deformation theory.

To our knowledge. this is the first time single molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy has been used to extract structural information from solution-phase fluorescence measurements. We find that production of oriented species is strongly favored in “poorer” solvents. where the polymer chains have more compact solution-phase structures.

The J/ψ is detected via its dimuon decay in the forward rapidity region (− 4.0< y<− 2.5) for events where the hadronic activity is required to be minimal. The analysis is based on an event sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 750 μb− 1. The cross section for coherent J/ψ production is presented in six rapidity bins. The results are compared with theoretical models for coherent J/ψ photoproduction. These comparisons indicate that gluon shadowing effects play a role in the photoproduction process.

These barriers are measured using human genetic distance from the technology frontier. The results based on cross-sectional data for 123 countries suggest that genetic distance to the global frontier has an economically and statistically significant effect on financial development. in that countries that are genetically far from the technology leader tend to have lower levels of financial development. Genetic distance is found to have the largest effect. even after controlling for other determinants of financial development established in the literature.

The technique uses a laser-induced shock wave to drive a liquid microjet at a very high speed such that the jet has sufficient momentum to penetrate soft targets. The method can be used to deliver liquid drugs into soft tissues in the human body. The liquid to be delivered is sandwiched between 200 μm thick aluminum foil and a base plate with a perforation of 100 μm diameter. The aluminum foil is ablated using an Nd:YAG laser beam in order to launch a shock wave through it.

Methyltransferases are involved in the third step of the process. transferring a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to N7-guanine (cap 0) and to the ribose 2′OH group (cap 1) of the first RNA nucleotide; capping is essential for mRNA stability and proper replication.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of human tuberculosis. one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world. Its genome hosts the glbN and glbO genes coding for two proteins. truncated hemoglobin N (trHbN) and truncated hemoglobin O (trHbO). that belong to different groups (I and II. respectively) of the recently discovered trHb family of hemeproteins. The different expression pattern and kinetics rates constants for ligand association and NO oxidation rate suggest different functions for these proteins. Previous experimental and theoretical studies showed that. in trHbs. ligand migration along the internal tunnel cavity system is a key issue in determining the ligand‐binding characteristics. The X‐ray structure of trHbO has been solved and shows several internal cavities and secondary‐docking sites.

In the case of human neuroglobin. cysteines at positions CD7 and D5 are sufficiently close to form an internal disulfide bond. For cytoglobin. the cysteine residues at positions A7 and GH4 may also form a disulfide bond. Mass spectrometry. ligand binding. and thiol accessibility studies were used to study the role influence of these disulfide bonds.

Different chemical aspects of the cofactor are exploited during catalysis by the isomerases and the methyltransferases. Thus. the cobalt-carbon bond ruptures homolytically in the isomerases. whereas it is cleaved heterolytically in the methyltransferases. The reaction mechanism of the dehalogenases. the most recently discovered class of B 12 enzymes. is poorly understood.

The dominant candidate mechanism for sulfide signaling is persulfidation of target proteins. However. the relatively poor reactivity of H 2 S toward oxidized thiols. such as disulfides. the low concentration of disulfides in the reducing milieu of the cell and the low steady-state concentration of H 2 S raise questions about the plausibility of persulfide formation via reaction between an oxidized thiol and a sulfide anion or a reduced thiol and oxidized hydrogen disulfide.

Inc.,Significance: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S). produced by the desulfuration of cysteine or homocysteine. functions as a signaling molecule in an array of physiological processes including regulation of vascular tone. the cellular stress response. apoptosis. and inflammation. Recent Advances: The low steady-state levels of H2S in mammalian cells have been recently shown to reflect a balance between its synthesis and its clearance. The subversion of enzymes in the cytoplasmic trans-sulfuration pathway for producing H2S from cysteine and/or homocysteine versus producing cysteine from homocysteine. presents an interesting regulatory problem.

A particularly puzzling aspect of hATR function is that the midpoint potential for Co2+Cbl → Co1+Cbl reduction is below that of readily available biological reductants. Our magnetic circular dichroism and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic studies reported here reveal that. in the absence of ATP. the interaction between Co2+Cbl and hATR promotes partial conversion of the cofactor to its “base-off” form in which a water molecule occupies the lower axial position. This interaction becomes much stronger in the presence of ATP. leading to the formation of an unprecedented Co2+Cbl species with spectroscopic signatures consistent with an essentially four-coordinate. square-planar Co2+ center.

We have shown that it is a stepwise process in which conformational changes in the 5‘-deoxyadenosine moiety precede the actual homolysis step. In the transition state structure for homolysis. the Co−C5‘ bond elongates by ∼0.5 Å from the value found in the substrate-bound reactant complex. The overall barrier to homolysis is ∼10 kcal/mol. and the radical products are ∼2.5 kcal/mol less stable than the initial ternary complex of enzyme. substrate. and cofactor.

FoxP3 is a master regulator of Treg function. and its expression is under control of several epigenetically labile promoters and enhancers. Demethylation of CpG sites within these regions is associated with increased FoxP3 expression and development of a suppressive phenotype. We examined differences in FoxP3 expression between young (3–4 months) and aged (18–20 months) C57BL/6 mice.

Analysis of the model has shown that AdoMet metabolism can operate under two different modes. The first. with low metabolic rate and low AdoMet concentration. serves predominantly to supply the cell with AdoMet. the substrate for various cellular methylation reactions. The second. with high metabolic rate and high AdoMet concentration. provides an avenue for cleavage of excess methionine and can serve as a source of cysteine when its increased synthesis is necessary. The switch that triggers interconversion between the “low” and “high” modes is methionine concentration. Under a certain set of parameters both modes may coexist.

Here. we report the discovery that chronologically aging yeast cells undergo a sudden redox collapse. which affects over 80% of identified thiol-containing proteins. We present evidence that this redox collapse is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants as would have been postulated by the free radical theory of aging. Instead it appears to be instigated by a substantial drop in cellular NADPH. which normally provides the electron source for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. This decrease in NADPH levels occurs very early during lifespan and sets into motion a cascade that is predicted to down-regulate most cellular processes. Caloric restriction. a near-universal lifespan extending measure. increases NADPH levels and delays each facet of the cascade.

While the role of PLP in the reaction is suggested by the beta replacement reaction that is catalyzed. the role of the heme is not yet well established. Spectroscopic studies reveal that the heme iron is coordinately saturated in the ferric and ferrous states and is relatively inert to ligand exchange in the oxidized state.

We generated monoclonal antibodies (9A2 and 15H8) against the human fXII heavy chain that interfere with fXII conversion to the protease factor XIIa (fXIIa). The anti-fXII antibodies were tested in models in which anti-fXI antibodies are known to have antithrombotic effects. Both anti-fXII antibodies reduced fibrin formation in human blood perfused through collagen-coated tubes. fXII-deficient mice are resistant to ferric chloride–induced arterial thrombosis. and this resistance can be reversed by infusion of human fXII. 9A2 …,True,ONC4UxYAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C,170,https://ashpublications.org/blood/article-abstract/123/11/1739/105748,5675206673055173925,/scholar?cites=5675206673055173925,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497120358973,0,0,0

113390,Tissue factor as a proinflammatory agent,2002,Maria I Bokarewa and James H Morrissey and Andrej Tarkowski,4,,3,1-6,BioMed Central,Tissue factor (TF) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and the main triggering element of blood coagulation. TF expression on monocytes and endothelial cells is induced by exposure to endotoxin. tumor necrosis factor. and IL-1 and is considered to appear in consequence of inflammation. In order to assess the proinflammatory capacity of TF itself. the recombinant extracellular domain of TF was injected intra-articularly into healthy mice. To characterize the role of immune cells in the TF-induced arthritis. mice deprived of lymphocytes. neutrophils and monocytes were used. Histomorphological analysis of the joints with respect to inflammatory cell infiltration. pannus formation and erosion formation revealed development of arthritis in 80% of animals injected with TF. In most of the cases synovial proliferation was accompanied by pannus formation and cartilage destruction. Inflammatory cell infiltrate consisted of CD4-Mac1+ macrophages. Depletion of monocytes was. however. not enough to abolish inflammation. Indeed. combined deficiency of monocytes and lymphocytes was required to prevent inflammation following the injection of TF. We observed that TF induced chemokine production (MIP-1α and RANTES). but did not induce a proliferative response nor cytokine release by mouse spleen cells. TF has strong inflammatogenic properties mediated predominantly by monocytes and their release of chemokines. Our study shows that TF can simultaneously trigger the immune and coagulation systems.,True,ONC4UxYAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC,86,https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/ar405,12440770815268199430,/scholar?cites=12440770815268199430,,https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/ar405,0,0,0

113428,Polyphosphate: a link between platelets. coagulation and inflammation,2012,James H Morrissey,95,,4,346-352,Springer Japan,Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is abundant in biological organisms. PolyP is a major component of dense granules of human platelets and is secreted upon platelet activation. Studies from our lab and others have shown that polyP is a potent modulator of the blood clotting cascade. acting as a pro-hemostatic. prothrombotic and proinflammatory agent depending on its polymer size and location. PolyP may represent at least one of the long-sought (patho)physiologic activators of the contact pathway of blood clotting. and its actions may also help to explain previously unexplained abilities of activated platelets to enhance plasma clotting reactions. PolyP may have utility as a hemostatic agent to control bleeding. and conversely. polyP antagonists might have utility as antithrombotic/anti-inflammatory agents with reduced bleeding side effects.

Indeed. certain epidemiologic studies have found elevated FVII coagulant activity to be an independent risk factor for heart disease. However. FVII circulates as the inert zymogen (FVII). the active enzyme (FVIIa). and possibly other forms as well. obscuring the relationship between any specific form of this enzyme and risk of thrombotic disease. New assay techniques based on soluble mutant tissue factor now permit measurement of FVIIa without interference from the large excess of zymogen FVII in plasma.

SNPs initiate the contact pathway of the blood‐clotting system; short‐chain polyP accelerates the common pathway by the rapid formation of thrombin. which enhances the overall blood‐clotting system. both by accelerating fibrin generation and by facilitating the regulatory anticoagulation mechanisms essential for hemostasis. Analysis of the clotting properties of bare SNPs. bare polyP. and polyP‐functionalized SNPs in plasma demonstrated that the attachment of polyP to SNPs to form polyP‐SNPs creates a substantially enhanced synergistic effect that lowers clotting time and increases thrombin production at low concentrations. PolyP‐SNP even retains its clotting function at ambient temperature.

C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). is the only known plasma inhibitor of C1s. the initiating serine protease of the classical pathway of complement. Like other serpin-protease partners. C1-INH interaction with C1s is accelerated by polyanions such as heparin. Polyphosphate (polyP) is a naturally occurring polyanion with effects on coagulation and complement.
