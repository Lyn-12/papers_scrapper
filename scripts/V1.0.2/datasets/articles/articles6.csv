HIV also has tropism for the brain leading to neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Besides inducing cell death. HIV can interfere with T4 cell function by various mechanisms.

Blood-borne transmission constitutes the other major recognized form of spread of the disease. although it is highly likely that the disease is not readily spread through casual. nonsexual. non-blood-borne routes. Although the disease is still highly concentrated in the United States. it is now seen in several countries throughout the world. The common denominator of the disease is a profound suppression of cell-mediated immunity. specifically a quantitative and qualitative defect in the T4 inducer or helper subset of T lymphocytes. Hyperactivity of B lymphocytes is also characteristic. The clinical manifestations are those of severe and life-threatening opportunistic infections and …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,1367,https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/0003-4819-100-1-92,6553712559583658019,/scholar?cites=6553712559583658019,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.731.2503&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

Glucocorticosteroids cause neutrophilic leukocytosis together with eosinopenia. monocytopenia. and lymphocytopenia. A principal mechanism whereby corticosteroids suppress inflammation is their impeding the access of neutrophils and monocytes to an inflammatory site. Granulocyte function is relatively refractory. whereas monocyte-macrophage function seems to be particularly sensitive to corticosteroids. Corticosteroid administration causes a transient lymphocytopenia of all detectable lymphocyte subpopulations. particularly the recirculating thymus-derived lymphocyte. The mechanism of this lymphocytopenia is probably a redistribution of circulating cells to other body compartments.

23946,Corticosteroid,1982,Anthony S Fauci and TR CUPPS,65,Immunol Rev,,133 citation_lastpage= 155,,RESULTSSince the initial 51Cr labeling of cells was done on the leukocyte-rich supernate from dextran-sedimented whole blood. it was necessary to rule out the possibility that the radioactivity which was assayed in the samples drawn following reinfusion of labeled cells was due to contaminating platelets. granulocytes. or red blood cells (RBC). As mentioned above. determinations of lymphocyteassociated radioactivity and specific activity of lymphocytes were done on Hypaque-Ficoll-separated cells. These suspensions were macroscopically free of RBC. This fact was confirmed by examination of cytocentrifuged smears stained with Wright-Giemsa stain. It was found that only rare RBC per highpower field were seen in these smears. However. in order to rule out totally the possibility that these few contaminating RBC were significantly contributing to the activity of the samples. Hypaque-Ficoll suspensions of specimens from four subjects at different time periods in the study were examined for activity prior to and following hypotonic lysis of RBC. It was found that this maneuver decreased the activity of the specimens by only 5.5%±1.2%. This small decrease was due most likely to the minimal damage to the mononuclear cells themselves by the hypotonic exposure as well as to the small amount of elution of label consistently seen with washing alone.As mentioned previously. granulocytes make up only about 1% of the Hypaque-Ficoll mononuclear cell layer. and so any contribution by granulocytes to the total activity of the cell suspension would be negligible. In addition. the half-life of granulocytes is sufficiently short’7 that most of the labeled …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,1091,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b09d/07ce2b081a41fd9d052c02ffc972b7dbcb76.pdf,2329084205594903972,/scholar?cites=2329084205594903972,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b09d/07ce2b081a41fd9d052c02ffc972b7dbcb76.pdf,0

Fifty patients with the idiopathic HES were studied over 11 years at the National Institutes of Health. Multiple organ systems were involved; bone marrow hypereosinophilia was common to all patients. but the most severe clinicopathologic involvement was of the heart and nervous system. Postmortem gross pathologic examination of the hearts of patients with idiopathic and nonidiopathic HES suggested that the common mechanism of cardiac disease is the eosinophilia.

23949,Multifactorial nature of human immunodeficiency virus disease: implications for therapy,1993,Anthony S Fauci,262,Science,5136,1011-1018,American Association for the Advancement of Science,The immunopathogenic mechanisms underlying human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease are extremely complex; the disease process is multifactorial with multiple overlapping phases. Viral burden is substantial and viral replication occurs throughout the entire course of HIV infection. Inappropriate immune activation and elevated secretion of certain cytokines compound the pathogenic process. Profound immunosuppression ultimately occurs together with a disruption of the microenvironment of the immune system. which is probably unable to regenerate spontaneously. Thus. therapeutic strategies in HIV disease must not be unidimensional. but rather must be linked to the complex pathogenic components of the disease and must address where feasible each of the recognized pathogenic processes for the possibility of therapeutic intervention.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,1027,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/262/5136/1011.abstract,9045395313930801458,/scholar?cites=9045395313930801458,,,0

During this early viremic phase. the virus is trapped within the processes of follicular dendritic cells in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissue. Also. during this phase of primary infection. some patients show major expansions of certain subsets of CD8+ T cells that are identified by the expression of a particular variable region of the β chain of the T-cell receptor. These expansions are manifestations of responses to HIV that may be important in controlling the progression of HIV infection.

TNF-alpha treatment of ACH2 cells resulted in an increase in steady-state levels of HIV RNA and HIV transcription. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that the transcriptional activation of the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) by TNF-alpha was associated with the induction of a nuclear factor(s) binding to the NF-kappa B sites in the LTR. Deletion of the NF-kappa B sites from the LTR eliminated activation by TNF-alpha in T cells transfected with plasmids in which the HIV LTR directed the expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Thus. TNF-alpha appears to activate HIV RNA and virus production by ACH2 cells through the induction of transcription-activating factors that bind to the NF-kappa B sequences …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,848,https://www.pnas.org/content/86/15/5974.short,17907482121273201675,/scholar?cites=17907482121273201675,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/86/15/5974.full.pdf,0

In addition. both the uninfected parental cell line (A3.01) and the infected ACH-2 cells were shown to have high-affinity receptors for TNF-alpha.

Before entering the study. all patients had active and progressive disease. even though 16 patients had been receiving corticosteroids that had caused severe and often incapacitating toxic side effects. Three patients died during the study. Complete and often dramatic remissions occurred in the surviving 14 patients. who were then placed on alternate-day corticosteroid treatment with continuation of cyclophosphamide. Corticosteroids were later discontinued in seven patients. The mean duration of remission was 22 months (range. two to 61).

Monokine induction of ACH-2 cells resulted in augmented virus production reflected by an increase in reverse transcriptase activity and in the synthesis of all major viral proteins. Examination of the cells by indirect immunofluorescence revealed that 10 to 15% of uninduced cells constitutively expressed HIV proteins. whereas 100% showed positive immunofluorescence in response to LPS-MO SN.

Recently. an inactive CCR5 allele (designated here as CCR5-2) was identified that confers resistance to HIV-1 infection in homozygotes and slows the rate of progression to AIDS in heterozygotes. The reports conflict on the effect of heterozygous CCR5-2 on HIV-1 susceptibility. and race and risk levels have not yet been fully analyzed. Here we report our independent identification of CCR5-2 and test its effects on HIV-1 pathogenesis in individuals with contrasting clinical outcomes. defined race. and quantified risk. Mutant CCR5 alleles were sought by directed heteroduplex analysis of genomic DNA from random blood donors. Genotypic frequencies were then determined in (1) random blood donors from North America. Asia. and Africa; (2) HIV-1 + individuals; and (3) highly exposed-seronegative homosexuals with quantified risk. CCR5-2 was the only mutant allele found. It was common in Caucasians. less common in other North American racial groups. and not detected in West Africans or Tamil Indians. Homozygous CCR5-2 frequencies differed reciprocally in highly exposed-seronegative (4.5%. n = 111) and HIV-1-seropositive (0%. n = 614) Caucasians relative to Caucasian random blood donors (0.8%. n = 387). This difference was highly significant (p < 0.0001). By contrast. heterozygous CCR5-2 frequencies did not differ significantly in the same three groups (21.6. 22.6. and 21.7%. respectively).

Although HIV can directly kill CD4+ T cells in vitro. the protracted course of HIV infection in vivo suggests that other pathogenic mechanisms are also involved. As a member of the lentivirus family. HIV can remain latent within the genome of the infected cell. Activation of HIV expression from a latent or low-level state of replication is dependent. in part. on the state of activation of the host cell. As a result. activation of HIV-infected CD4+ T cells or monocytel macrophages during normal immune responses may ultimately result in the activation of HIV expression and spread of the infection. Thus. HIV may have developed the ability to use normal immune processes to its own reproductive …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC,359,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016756999090070P,7612478098219521940,/scholar?cites=7612478098219521940,,,0

The initial pathogenic event in HIV infection is binding of the envelope glycoprotein of HIV to the CD4 receptor molecule present on the surface of CD4+ T lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages. In vivo the reservoir for HIV infection in the peripheral blood is the CD4+ T cell. whereas in other tissues the monocyte/macrophage may play a substantial role. As disease progresses in HIV‐infected individuals. the viral burden in the peripheral blood CD4+ T cells increases.

The common denominator of the disease is the profound immunosuppression that occurs in the vast majority of infected patients. Studies in lymphoid tissues in HIV disease have provided considerable insight into the pathogenic processes involved from the earliest phases of infection through the advanced stages. Following primary infection. virus is disseminated throughout the body and seeds the lymphoid tissue where its replication is only incompletely suppressed and where a reservoir of virus is established. Extracellular virus is trapped within the FDC of the lymph node germinal centers and serves as a source of infection for cells which reside in or migrate through the lymph node throughout the course of infection even during the early and often prolonged asymptomatic period. Eventually. the architecture of the lymphoid tissue is destroyed. compounding the immune dysfunction that results from the depletion of CD4+ T cells. In this regard. the lymphoid tissue of LTNPs is relatively intact and viral burden and replication is considerably lower in the peripheral blood and lymph node mono-nuclear cells of LTNPs than in individuals whose disease progresses. Cytokines probably play a major role in the modulation of HIV expression in the milieu of the lymphoid tissue.

Currently. it is not known whether tissue-associated Treg cells maintain suppressive activity in the context of HIV infection. particularly in individuals with advanced disease. The present study demonstrates that CD25+ Treg cells isolated from lymph nodes and peripheral blood of HIV+ subjects. even those with high viral loads and/or low CD4 …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C,218,https://www.pnas.org/content/104/9/3390.short,15529196807141841562,/scholar?cites=15529196807141841562,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/104/9/3390.full.pdf,0

In addition. IL-1 synergized with IL-6. but not with tumor necrosis factor. in the upregulation of virus expression in U1 cells as measured by accumulation of steady-state mRNAs and production of reverse transcriptase activity. The HIV inductive effect of IL-1 was blocked by transforming growth factor beta. anti-IL-1 antibodies. or monoclonal antibodies directed to the type 1. but not to the type 2. cell surface receptor for IL-1; the latter actually caused enhancement of the IL-1-mediated effect.

We describe herein a population of immature/transitional B cells that is overly represented in the peripheral blood of individuals with advancing HIV disease. These B cells. identified by the expression of CD10. were unresponsive by proliferation to B cell receptor triggering and possessed a phenotype and an Ig diversity profile that confirmed their immature/transitional stage of differentiation. Consistent with an immature status. their lack of proliferation to B cell receptor triggering was reversed with CD40 ligand. but not B cell activation factor. Finally. levels of CD10 expression on B cells were directly correlated with serum levels of IL-7. suggesting that increased levels of IL-7 modulate human B cell maturation either directly or indirectly by means of a homeostatic effect on lymphopenia.

This apparent defect was not simply a result of a delayed response because little cytolysis was evident in kinetics experiments even after 24 h of incubation. NK cells from C-HS donors failed to lyse adherent (MDA. CEM. and Alab) or nonadherent (K562 and Molt-4) tumor cell lines or nontransformed human fetal fibroblasts. Therefore. the apparent C-HS defect was not a result of a shift in target selectivities. In addition. the depressed reactivity did not appear to be a result of suppressor cells or factors because: (a) enriched NK populations (nonadherent lymphocytes bearing receptors for the Fc portion of IgG) from C-HS donors were low in NK-cell function.

These discrepancies could potentially be explained by the existence of multiple subsets of cells with dendritic morphology in peripheral blood. The isolation of DCs in humans is accomplished through negative selection until a morphologically pure population is obtained. Recently. DC precursors purified from peripheral blood by negative selection have been observed to develop into functionally and morphologically mature DCs. In this report we identify three populations of cells in peripheral blood that have or can develop a dendritic morphology.

T cell depleted suspensions of tonsillar as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes had markedly diminished if not absent PFC responses following PWM stimulation. The PFC responses of T cell depleted cultures of tonsil and blood could be reconstituted by adding back T cells.

The virus must breach physical barriers before it infects mucosal CD4+ T cells. Low-level viral replication occurs initially in mucosal CD4+ T cells. but within days high-level replication occurs in Peyer's patches. the gut lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes. Understanding the early events in HIV transmission may provide valuable information relevant to the development of an HIV vaccine. The viral quasispecies in a donor contracts through a genetic bottleneck in the recipient. such that. in low-risk settings. infection is frequently established by a single founder virus. Early-transmitting viruses in subtypes A and C mucosal transmission tend to encode gp120s with reduced numbers of N-linked glycosylation sites at specific positions throughout the V1-V4 domains. relative to typical chronically replicating isolates in the donor quasispecies. The transmission advantage gained by the absence of these N-linked glycosylation sites is unknown. Using primary α4β7+/CD4+ T cells and a flow-cytometry based steady-state binding assay we show that the removal of transmission-associated N-linked glycosylation sites results in large increases in the specific reactivity of gp120 for integrin- α4β7. High-affinity for integrin α4β7. although not found in many gp120s. was observed in early-transmitting gp120s that we analyzed. Increased α4β7 affinity is mediated by sequences encoded in gp120 V1/V2. α4β7-reactivity was also influenced by N-linked glycosylation sites located in C3/V4. These results suggest that the genetic bottleneck that occurs after transmission may frequently involve a relative requirement for the …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:wUn16MOA3RoC,157,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001301,16222073196330536963,/scholar?cites=16222073196330536963,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001301,0

The multivariate results indicate that at the time of the survey. consistent condom use in non-marital relationships is significantly higher for males than females. higher among those who had access to information about condoms from multiple sources than among those with limited access. and higher among those who have positive attitudes to condoms than among those with negative attitudes. Even though consistent condom use with non-marital partners is higher for those who know a source where condoms can be obtained. this effect is due to the fact that these respondents have more positive attitudes towards condoms. Likewise. the higher levels of consistent condom use exhibited by those who are aware of the efficacy of condoms are due to the fact that men have higher awareness of this. and men use condoms more consistently than women. In sum. the results suggest that the effects of the respondents’ sex and their knowledge of the prophylactic importance of condoms and where condoms might be obtained are a function of other socioeconomic advantages they have. It is. therefore. concluded that programmes that use mass media information. education and communication campaigns to reduce shyness. embarrassment and stigma about condom use can help increase consistent use of condoms in non-marital relationships …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:Pptk7XUfJl0C,145,https://www.psi.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Adetunji-J.-Meekers-D.-2001-WP-30.pdf,790467286082107240,/scholar?cites=790467286082107240,,https://www.psi.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Adetunji-J.-Meekers-D.-2001-WP-30.pdf,0

In the early stages of an HIV-1 infection CCR5 using viruses (R5 viruses) predominate. In some viral subtypes there is a propensity to switch to CXCR4 usage (X4 viruses). The receptor switch occurs in ~ 40% of the infected individuals and is associated with faster disease progression. This holds for subtypes B and D. but occurs less frequently in subtypes A and C. There are several hypotheses to explain the preferential transmission of R5 viruses and the mechanisms that lead to switching of co-receptor usage; however. there is no definitive explanation for either.

In fact. the high mutation rate occurring in HIV-1 envelope proteins and the complex structure of gp120 as an oligomer associated with gp41 result in a high degree of antigenic polymorphism. To overcome these obstacles. we screened random peptide libraries using sera from HIV-infected subjects to identify antigenic and immunogenic mimics of HIV-1 epitopes. After extensive counterscreening with HIV-negative sera. we isolated peptides specifically recognized by Abs from HIV-1-infected individuals.

The existence of a long and variableclinical latent period in HIV infection (with a mean of approximately 7 years) suggests that the virusitself may be relatively dormant for extended periods of time after primary infection. However. it is not known whether true microbiologie latency exists in which there is no detectable expression of virus in an infected cell. The phenomenon of prolonged clinical latency may reflect that. in infected individuals. HIV exists predominantly in a state of chronic or low-level expression.

Their effectiveness is well established in a wide range of such disorders. many of which are of a chronic nature. Although corticosteroids may be therapeutically quite effective in such situations. it is usually required that the drug be administered chronically over extended periods of time in order to maintain suppression of disease activity.The efficacy of corticosteroids in these diseases most likely relates to a combination and overlap of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. The magnitude of these effects is directly related to the duration of action of the drug. the dose and the interval between doses [l].

Compared to a more than 400-fold defect in NK activity in terms of lytic units. the abnormal ADCC response in C-HS donors was 24-fold below normal suggesting a partial but not complete overlap of lymphocytes or lytic mechanisms responsible for ADCC and NK. The ADCC mechanism against erythrocyte targets. however. was normal. thereby suggesting a qualitative difference in these two forms of ADCC. Other effector-cell functions against tumor-cell targets were normal as measured by (a) spontaneous cytolysis mediated by monocytes.

Gram-negative bacteria are directly fluoresceinated and then incubated in non-immune human serum. which leads to complement fixation via activation of the alernative complement pathway. Complement receptor-bearing mononuclear cells (CRMC) will form easily readable rosettes with these bacteria. The method requires no antibody preparation or purification. uses human serum rather than purified complement components or mouse serum. and gives results that correlate closely (r = 0.9015) with the EAC method of identifying CRMC. Furthermore. these indicator cells cannot bind to mononuclear cells via the E or IgG Fc receptors. eliminating this source of possible error.

Chemotaxis was measured with a morphologic Boyden-chamber assay using endotoxinactivated serum as the chemoattractant. Twenty-four hours after prednisone administration eosinophil chemotaxis was reduced by more than 50%. and it had fully recovered by 48 hr. Neutrophil chemotaxis was never depressed. and at 48 hr it was significantly increased over the baseline value. Hence. these studies show that whereas corticosteroids have similar effects in decreasing both neutrophil and eosinophil adherence. they have differential effects on locomotion. in that eosinophil chemotaxis is significantly suppressed by drug administration while neutrophil chemotaxis is not suppressed. It should be emphasized that the eosinophils used in this study were taken from patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome. and thus they may not truly represent normal eosinophils.

Four of the 28 patients initially had a stroke caused by occlusion of one or more thoracic aortic arch arteries.

It has been difficult to develop an in vitro model of antigen-specific triggering of antibody synthesis by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that is independent of exogenous mitogens. In the present study a sensitive and reproducible culture system and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay have been established wherein antigen alone is used to trigger antigen-specific antibody synthesis by mononuclear cells from subjects immunized to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). The in vitro antigen-induced anti-KLH response is comparable in magnitude to that induced by pokeweed mitogen. is predominantly IgM in isotype. and is accompanied by a simultaneous increase in polyclonal antibody production.

Previous studies have found that these cells can suppress HIV in vitro; additionally. pDCs have been shown to be severely reduced in the peripheral blood of HIV-infected individuals. In the present study. we sought to determine the ability of pDCs to directly suppress viral replication ex vivo and to delineate the potential mechanisms whereby pDCs are depleted in HIV-infected individuals. We demonstrate that activated pDCs strongly suppress HIV replication in autologous CD4+ T cells via a mechanism involving IFN-α as well as other antiviral factors. Of note. unstimulated pDCs from infected individuals who maintain low levels of plasma viremia without antiretroviral therapy were able to suppress HIV ex vivo via a mechanism requiring cell-to-cell contact. Our data also demonstrate that death of pDCs by both apoptosis and necrosis is induced by fusion of HIV with pDCs. Taken together. our data suggest that pDCs play an important role in the control of HIV replication and that high levels of viral replication in vivo are associated with pDC cell death via apoptosis and necrosis.

24368,Induction of nuclear factor-kappa B and the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat by okadaic acid. a specific inhibitor of phosphatases 1 and 2A.,1990,C Thevenin and SJ Kim and P Rieckmann and H Fujiki and MA Norcross and MB Sporn and AS Fauci and JH Kehrl,2,The New biologist,9,793-800,,We have used a specific phosphatase inhibitor. okadaic acid. to examine the role of two phosphatases. PP1 and PP2A. in the induction of NF-kappa B and the long terminal repeat of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-LTR). Treatment of Jurkat cells with okadaic acid induced NF-kappa B in nuclear extracts. The rate of induction by okadaic acid was delayed compared to the induction of NF-kappa B by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The induction of NF-kappa B by okadaic acid was enhanced by cycloheximide or phytohemagglutinin (PHA). In contrast to PMA. okadaic acid appeared to induce NF-kappa B independently of protein kinase C (PKC). That the NF-kappa B induced by okadaic acid was functional was demonstrated by the marked increase in CAT activity that occurred in Jurkat. BJA-B. and U251 cells that were transfected with HIV-LTR-CAT and treated with okadaic acid. The increase in CAT activity triggered by okadaic acid was dependent on the presence of the NF-kappa B sites in the long terminal repeat of HIV as assessed by deletion and mutation analysis. Similarly to its effect on the induction of NF-kappa B. PHA added together with okadaic acid resulted in a further increase in CAT activity. Somewhat surprisingly. the addition of PMA inhibited the increase in CAT activity in response to okadaic acid. which suggests that the activation of PKC may also induce inhibitory factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS),True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C,100,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2177654,15041461666337258832,/scholar?cites=15041461666337258832,,,0

In vitro studies have shown that natural killer (NK) cells purified from healthy donors can kill heterologous cell lines or autologous CD4+ T cell blasts exogenously infected with several strains of HIV-1. However. it is not known whether the deleterious effects of high HIV-1 viremia interferes with the NK cell-mediated cytolysis of autologous. endogenously HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. Here. we stimulate primary CD4+ T cells. purified ex vivo from HIV-1-infected viremic patients. with PHA and rIL2 (with or without rIL-7). This experimental procedure allows for the significant expansion and isolation of endogenously infected CD4+ T cell blasts detected by intracellular staining of p24 HIV-1 core antigen. We show that. subsequent to the selective down-modulation of MHC class-I (MHC-I) molecules. HIV-1-infected p24pos blasts become partially susceptible to lysis by rIL-2-activated NK cells. while uninfected p24neg blasts are spared from killing. This NK cell-mediated killing occurs mainly through the NKG2D activation pathway. However. the degree of NK cell cytolytic activity against autologous. endogenously HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cell blasts that down-modulate HLA-A and –B alleles and against heterologous MHC-Ineg cell lines is particularly low.

HIV disease is characterized by a prolonged period. usually lasting several years. of clinical latency. During this period viremia is generally very low or undetectable. the number of infected cells (i.e. viral burden) in the blood are very low. and the levels of viral replication in these cells are barely detectable. These findings have been interpreted as a reflection of a phase of inactive HIV disease during which time HIV replicates very slowly or its replicating ability is kept under control by effective HIV specific immune responses.

We demonstrate that cross-linking CD30 with an anti-CD30-specific monoclonal antibody. which mimics the described biological activities of the CD30 ligand (CD30L). results in HIV expression. CD30 cross-linking does not alter proliferation of ACH-2 cells and the induction of HIV expression is not mediated by endogenous TNFα/β. Furthermore. cross-linking of CD30 leads to NF-κB activation and enhanced HIV transcription. Thus. CD30-CD30L Interactions mediate the induction of HIV expression by a κB-dependent path-way that is Independent of TNF.

Soluble CD4 (sCD4). the first drug in this class. failed to suppress viral replication in vivo. At least three factors contributed to this failure: sCD4 demonstrated poor neutralizing activity against most primary isolates of HIV in vitro; it demonstrated an intrinsic capacity to enhance viral replication at low concentrations; and it exhibited a relatively short half-life in vivo. Many anti-gp120 monoclonal antibodies. including neutralizing monoclonal antibodies also enhance viral replication at suboptimal concentrations.

We have previously reported that interleukin (IL)-10 inhibited HIV replication in acutely infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) at concentrations that completely blocked the production of endogenous tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 from infected cells. In the present study. lower concentrations of IL-10. which were unable to completely suppress endogenous cytokines. paradoxically enhanced HIV replication in MDM induced by other cytokines. This synergistic induction of HIV expression by IL-10 in combination with TNF-alpha. IL-6. and other cytokines was also observed in the chronically infected promonocytic cell line. U1. The enhancing effect of IL-10 was correlated with an increase in HIV mRNA accumulation and potentiation of phorbol ester-induced long terminal repeat-driven transcription that was independent of the NF-kappa B and Sp1 transcription factors. Thus. IL-10 is a cytokine capable of exerting complex regulatory effects on HIV expression in MP as a function of its own concentration and of the presence of other HIV regulatory cytokines.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:LgRImbQfgY4C,88,https://europepmc.org/article/med/7627621,17368331564168295015,/scholar?cites=17368331564168295015,,,0

There is growing evidence. however. that treatment availability alone is insufficient to stop the epidemic. In South Africa. only one third of individuals living with HIV are actually on treatment. Treatment refusal has been identified as a phenomenon among people who are asymptomatic. however. factors driving refusal remain poorly understood. We interviewed 50 purposively sampled participants who presented for voluntary counseling and testing in Soweto to elicit a broad range of detailed perspectives on ART refusal. We then integrated our core findings into an explanatory framework. Participants described feeling “too healthy” to start treatment. despite often having a diagnosis of AIDS.

Cold Spring Harbor (NY),Infections by viruses of the lentivirus genus. most notably human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). are characterized by remarkably complex interactions with the host and a chronic course of disease. Common features of diseases caused by lentiviruses include long and variable incubation periods. persistent viral replication. neurologic manifestations. and destruction of specific hematologic or immunologic cells (Desrosiers and Letvin 1987); some of these characteristics. particularly as they relate to nonprimate lentiviruses. are described in Chapter 10 All lentiviruses exhibit a common morphogenesis and morphology. a tropism for macrophages. extensive genetic and antigenic variability. and the presence of additional regulatory genes not found in other groups of retroviruses. Lentiviruses are not directly oncogenic. although the immune disorders they induce often permit the growth of certain neoplasms. such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma. Lentiviruses have been isolated from several animal species including sheep. goats. horses. cattle. cats. monkeys. and humans. HIV-1 and HIV-2 are the only known human lentiviruses. Infection of humans with HIV-1 causes a dramatic decline in the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes. When the number of these cells becomes low enough. opportunistic infections and neoplasms occur. Neurologic abnormalities. which occur in a majority of HIV-infected individuals. can be observed in the absence of other clinical manifestations (Fauci 1988). The HIV-related lentiviruses of nonhuman primates are collectively called simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs).

This effect is present whether C1q is added to the B cells either at the beginning or near the end of a 7-day culture period and is not associated with enhancement of proliferation.

The diagnosis of chronic bronchitis is made by history. chronic airways obstruction is assessed physiologically. and emphysema can be diagnosed with certainty only by histologic examination of sections of whole lung fixed at inflation. Although the relationships between clinical characteristics. physiologic derangements. and morphologic changes have been diligently studied for many years. reasonably certain and uniform clinical criteria are still not available. Definitions and classifications have evolved. but these are not universally accepted. Nonetheless. the following definitions along with brief qualifications and descriptions are currently used by most persons involved in the diagnosis. treatment. and epidemiology of the chronic obstructive airways syndromes.DEFINITIONS Chronic bronchitis is a condition associated with excessive tracheobronchial mucus production sufficient to cause cough with expectoration for at least 3 months of the year for more than 2 consecutive years. Several subclassifications have been proposed. Simple chronic bronchitis describes a condition characterized by mucoid sputum production. Chronic mucopurulent bronchitis is characterized by persistent or recurrent purulence of sputum in the absence of localized suppurative diseases such as bronchiectasis.

We have previously shown that a variety of physiologic stimuli. including cytokines and cell stress. can up-regulate HIV expression from these cell lines. In this study we demonstrate that heat shock can also up-regulate the production of virus from both ACH-2 and U1 cells.

The mediation of the immunosuppressive effects of HC on lymphocyte responses via inhibition of monocyte function has been examined by monocyte-dependent. antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Monocytes that were first treated with HC and then washed were unaffected in their subsequent ability to present antigen. However. there was a dramatic inhibition of lymphocyte proliferative responses if HC was present while monocytes were pulsed with antigen. This was directly related to the dose of HC present. HC-mediated inhibition of monocyte antigen presentation could not be overcome by the addition of interleukin-1 (IL-1) to the cultures. and thus inhibition of monocyte IL-1 secretion cannot totally account for the inhibition of monocyte antigen presentation.

The precise mechanisms by which glucocorticoids impair the human immune response are unknown. Intracytoplasmic glucocorticoids specific receptors are important in the specificity of glucocorticoid actions. Glucocorticoid administration results in neutrophillia. monocytopenia. lymphopenia. and eosinopenia. A principle mechanism whereby glucocorticoids limit inflammation is by limiting the access of leukocytes. particularly neutrophils. to inflammatory sites. Neutrophil function is relatively refractory while monocyte and T-cell function is more easily impaired. A variety of glucocorticoid preparations are available for use. and appreciation of their relative potency and plasma half-lives is essential for designing therapeutic regimens. High doses and frequent administration of glucocorticoids are necessary in order to induce a remission in patients with flagrantly active disease. Once a remission is induced. the glucocorticoid regimen should be adjusted to attain maximal therapeutic benefit with minimal adverse effects.

Infection is initiated by a high-affinity interaction between CD4 and conserved domains on the viral envelope glycoprotein. In this report. we demonstrated that SIV had a restricted host range among human CD4+ cells when compared with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or type 2. This restricted tropism was associated with the inability of the SIV envelope glycoprotein to induce membrane fusion in cells not susceptible to productive exogenous infection by SIV.

Decreased complement fixation by IgG antibody at 37°C is independent of antibody affinity.

A major determinant of the pace of disease progression is the in vivo level of HIV-1 replication. which is regulated by a complex network of cytokines and chemokines expressed by immune and inflammatory cells. The chemokine system is critically involved in the control of HIV-1 replication by virtue of the role played by specific chemokine receptors. most notably CCR5 and CXCR4. as cell-surface coreceptors for HIV-1 entry; hence. the chemokines that naturally bind such coreceptors act as endogenous inhibitors of HIV-1.

Recent public concern over two H5N1 influenza manuscripts that studied the transmissibility of influenza viruses has triggered intense discussion on dual-use research and the way forward.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:K4-iKlO5MD4C,62,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6088/1522.abstract,9667900017276062527,/scholar?cites=9667900017276062527,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5101943/,0

This cellular reservoir of HIV had been thought to be quiescent with regard to virus replication based on the premise that HIV production in T cells is inexorably linked to cellular activation as determined by classical activation markers. The transition of T cells within this HIV reservoir from a resting state to an activated HIV-producing state is believed to be associated with a shorten life span due to susceptibility to activation-associated apoptosis. Evidence is mounting. however. that HIV production may occur in T cells that have not undergone classic T cell activation. HIV encodes several proteins. including envelope and Nef. which trigger a variety of signaling pathways associated with cellular activation. thereby facilitating HIV replication in nondividing cells.

MA,Dendritic cells (DC) are the first immunocompetent cells to encounter antigen at areas of inflammation in mucous membranes1. which are the major sites where the initiation of HIV infection occurs. HIV enters a mucous membrane and interacts with Langerhans cells (LC)/DC resulting in binding of the virus to the cell with or without infection. The cell then migrates and delivers virus to the paracortical region of the draining lymphoid tissue: LC/DC also provide activation stimuli to CD4+ T cells which become infected leading to replication and spread of virus2.3. Recently. in vivo data in the macaque model have clarified certain pathogenic events associated with primary simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection.

One of the first immunologic defects to be described in HIV-infected individuals is a deficiency in interleukin (IL)-2 production. The addition of IL-2 in vitro to cultures of mononuclear cells from HIV-infected individuals partially or completely restored certain defective cellular immune responses. However. production of or addition of IL-2 has also been associated with increased viral replication in infected T cells. These observations underscore the pernicious correlation between immune activation and HIV replication.

It was found that the plaque-forming B cells in this system are sensitive to CY over a wide concentration range including concentrations which have a minimal effect on overall cell viability.

HIV actively replicates in the lymphoid organs during this period. despite the fact that virus replication is barely detectable or absent in peripheral blood. Histopathologic alterations (ie. follicular hyperplasia and expansion of the FDC network) may partly explain the dichotomy between the levels of viral burden in the lymphoid organs versus peripheral blood. These findings demonstrate that lymphoid organs function as reservoirs and potentially as major sites of virus replication. However. they also indicate that the peripheral blood does not accurately reflect the actual state of HIV disease. particularly in early-stage infection. In fact. HIV disease is active and progressive even when there is little evidence of disease activity in peripheral blood.

However. these responses are minimal or absent in many HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore. while in vitro and in vivo responses to non-HIV recall Ags improve upon administration of highly active antiretroviral therapy. there does not appear to be a commensurate enhancement of HIV-specific immune responses. It is possible that CD4+ p24-specific T cells are deleted early in the course of infection.

Sarafotoxin S6b. an endothelin receptor agonist. was used as a tool to study endothelin receptor-mediated changes in the secretion of endothelin-1 and-3. The effects of sarafotoxin S6b and endothelin-1 in stimulating inositolphospholipid turnover as well as in inducing AP1 in primary astrocyte cultures were found to be similar. A low cross-reactivity of sarafotoxin S6b with endothelin-1 and-3 in the endothelin radioimmunoassays used here. along with a distinctly different elution position in high-performance liquid chromatography. allowed a clear discrimination between sarafotoxin and endothelins in the culture media. Stimulation of primary rat astrocytes with 10 (-7) M sarafotoxin S6b for 1 hour resulted in a substantial increase in endothelin-1 immunoreactivity in the medium. This immunoreactivity reached a peak at 3 hours and showed no further increase after 8 and 24 hours. Treatment of our cultures with phorbol myristate acetate. lipopolysaccharide. tumor necrosis factor alpha. and norepinephrine for 24 hours led to only a moderate elevation of endothelin-1 immunoreactivity. Immunoreactive endothelin-3 was not affected by any of the treatments tested. Thus. our data suggest that endothelins in primary rat astrocytes are subject to selective autoregulation. as demonstrated by the potentiation of endothelin-1 secretion after activation of glial endothelin receptors.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:1tZ8xJnm2c8C,51,https://europepmc.org/article/med/1648383,11294564903357425150,/scholar?cites=11294564903357425150,,,0

Infection of sub-optimally activated cells is believed to play a critical role in both the transmission of virus and the persistence of CD4+ T-cell reservoirs. There is accumulating evidence that HIV can modulate signal-transduction pathways in a manner that may facilitate replication in such cells. We previously demonstrated that HIV gp120 induces virus replication in resting CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV-infected individuals. Here. we show that in resting CD4+ T-cells. gp120 activates NFATs and induces their translocation into the nucleus.

It has been hypothesized that the appearance of CTL escape mutants represents an important mechanism by which HIV‐1 escapes the host cell‐mediated immune response. However. evidences for a direct relationship between CTL responses and emergence of CTL escape mutants are still limited. Here we report detailed longitudinal analysis of DNA sequence variation performed over the entire HIV‐1 envelope in two subjects during primary HIV infection. Estimates of the frequencies of synonymous (ds) and non‐synonymous (dN) nucleotide substitutions were used to identify regions of the HIV‐1 envelope which were subjected to significant levels of selective pressure.

Systemic dissemination of virus via the lymphatic system occurs at a very early stage after infection. Explosive viral replication within lymphoid tissue ensues. before the development of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. By the time potent immune responses downregulate viral expression. an immense viral reservoir within lymphoid tissue has already been established. During the stage of dichotomy in viral load between lymph node and peripheral blood. the viral reservoir is maintained by the ability of the follicular dendritic cells (FDC) network to efficiently trap extracellular virions. as well as by immunologic and microenvironmental factors favoring infection of susceptible cells and sequestration of cells already infected.

Treatment of chronically HIV-infected PBMC with anti-CD2 mAb has been shown to induce the expression of infectious virus from these cultures. In this study we investigated the mechanisms whereby anti-CD2 antibodies stimulate viral production. We demonstrate that treatment of transiently transfected T lymphocytes with anti-CD2 antibodies results in activation of the HIV long terminal repeat. Furthermore. CAT assays using mutated HIV long terminal repeat-CAT constructs and gel shift assays demonstrate that this activation is dependent on the NF-kappa B enhancer.

In this study. we investigated the integrity of plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)-NK cell interactions among HIV viremic. aviremic. and seronegative individuals. We describe a critical defect in the ability of pDCs from HIV-infected individuals to secrete IFN-α and TNF and subsequently activate NK cells. We also describe an inherent defect on NK cells from HIV-infected individuals to respond to pDC-secreted cytokines. Furthermore. we were able to demonstrate a direct effect of HIV trimeric gp120 on NK cells in vitro similar to that described ex vivo. Finally. we were able to establish that the HIV gp120-mediated suppressive effect on NK cells …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:17ZO-CJnx_8C,44,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/aid.2008.0311,5033187225728014606,/scholar?cites=5033187225728014606,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828160/,0

It aims to present. analyze. exchange. and criticize data among the different investigators and to attempt to resolve apparent inconsistencies and contradictions. The book first discusses the mitogen-and antigen-induced B-cell activation. It then explains the subpopulations of lymphocytes involved in the regulation of in vitro B-cell function and the clinical implications in the study of in vitro B-cell function. This book reflects the stimulation as well as the frustration during the workshop. It will serve as a small force and focus of direction in this most interesting. complex. and relevant area of human immunobiology.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:rOcdG6UcVlcC,41,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=o_jHCDgyl3sC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:t1EJ4rMakzoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=jYAky38D7R&sig=Qw50WV5ygtzeKR2eqyI49ySn3sU,4220746635670016439,/scholar?cites=4220746635670016439,,,0

Since 1981. it has claimed over 25 million lives and is currently responsible for over 2.5 million new infections worldwide each year 1. Although progress has been made in preventing new HIV infections and in lowering the annual number of AIDS-related deaths through comprehensive prevention programs and increased access to antiretroviral therapy. the number of people living with HIV--now over 33 million--continues to grow 1. Currently. only two out of five people who need treatment receive it. and even this modest level of progress in treatment is in jeopardy. as the availability of donor funds plateaus or declines 2.

Heidelberg,It is thought that a significant percentage (50-70%) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals experience a clinical syndrome of variable severity during primary infection. The symptoms are non specific. typical of a flu-like syndrome [7. 10. 47]. and include fever. sore throat. nausea. diarrhea. skin rash. myalgia. lymphadenopathy. and only rarely meningitis. However. due to the lack of specificity and to the variable severity of the clinical syndrome. hospitalization or medical intervention is required in only a minority of cases. and thus primary infection usually goes unnoticed.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:yY3RG6sOEgwC,41,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-60867-4_2,1059649136711297914,/scholar?cites=1059649136711297914,,,0

Ia-positive human T cells to present antigen were examined. Although activated T cells could present allo-Ia antigens. activated T cells could not present native. soluble protein antigens. We have now shown that activated T cells can present denatured protein antigens to stimulate proliferation of antigen-specific T-cell lines. Since denatures antigen may represent a processes form of antigen. the data suggest that activated T cells can present antigen but may not be able to process antigen as efficiently as other presenting cells. We have also shown that antigen-specific T-cell lines. which are also Ia positive. are able to present antigen to themselves. if the antigen is in denatured form. Autopresentation requires a critical minimal cell number to stimulate proliferation. even with denatured antigen.

This proliferative response was detected at Day 2. peaked at Day 5. and was dependent on the concentration of IL-2 used. At the initiation of culture. these cells did not appear to be activated as determined by the expression of Tac antigens. In cultures of unfractionated T-cell-enriched suspensions. high concentrations of IL-2 resulted in preferential expansion of the OKT8+ population. although both OKT4+ and OKT8+ cells proliferated in response to IL-2 when cultured alone.

The continuous presence of hydrocortisone in culture reduced the total number of cytotoxic lymphocytes recovered following their sensitization in mixed leukocyte cultures. However. corticosteroids had no direct effect on the processes required for generation of cytotoxic lymphocytes. since equal numbers of effector lymphocytes generated in the presence or absence of hydrocortisone produced equivalent. specific lympholysis.

Media conditioned by non-stimulated and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated astrocytes induced the expression of HIV-1 2.1-fold and 4.1-fold. respectively. LPS alone. media conditioned by the uninfected parental cell line of U1.1.5 (U937). and culture media from four other cell lines. had no effect on viral expression.

Hydrocortisone prevents the anti-mu-induced cell enlargement of small tonsillar B cells. blocks expression of the activation markers 4F2 and 5E9 induced by anti-mu. inhibits RNA synthesis of small B cells stimulated by anti-mu with or without BCGF. and suppresses B cell proliferation in response to anti-mu and BCGF or to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I. In contrast. hydrocortisone does not affect the proliferative response of in vitro or in vivo preactivated B cells.

Moreover. the effects of IL-7 have never been evaluated during acute HIV-1 (or SIV) infection. a critical phase of the disease in which the most dramatic depletion of CD4+ T cells is believed to occur. In the present study. recombinant. fully glycosylated simian IL-7 (50 µg/kg. s.c.. once weekly for 7 weeks) was administered to 6 rhesus macaques throughout the acute phase of infection with a pathogenic SIV strain (mac251); 6 animals were infected at the same time and served as untreated controls. Treatment with IL-7 did not cause clinically detectable side effects and. despite the absence of concomitant ART. did not induce significant increases in the levels of SIV replication except at the earliest time point tested (day 4 post-infection). Strikingly. animals treated with IL-7 were protected from the dramatic decline of circulating naïve and memory CD4+ T cells that occurred in untreated animals. Treatment with IL-7 induced only transient T-cell proliferation. but it was associated with sustained increase in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. persistent expansion of all circulating CD8+ T-cell subsets. and development of earlier and stronger SIV Tat-specific T-cell responses.

Methods A 72 week. non-inferiority trial enrolled one hundred forty six HIV positive persons receiving ART (CD4+ cell count ≥125 cells/mm3 and HIV RNA plasma levels <50 copies/ml) in one of three arms: continuous. 7 days on/7 days off and 5 days on/2 days off treatment. Primary endpoint was ART treatment failure determined by plasma HIV RNA level. CD4+ cell count decrease. death attributed to study participation. or opportunistic infection.  Results Following enrollment of 32 participants. the 7 days on/7 days off arm was closed because of a failure rate of 31%. Six of 52 (11.5%) participants in the 5 days on/2 days off arm failed. Five had virologic failure and one participant had immunologic failure. Eleven of 51 (21.6%) participants in the continuous treatment arm failed. Nine had virologic failure with 1 death (lactic acidosis) and 1 clinical failure (extra-pulmonary TB). The upper 97.5% confidence boundary for the difference between the percent of non-failures in the 5 days on/2 days off arm (88.5% non-failure) compared to continuous treatment (78.4% non failure) was 4.8% which is well within the preset non-inferiority margin of 15%. No significant difference was found in time to failure in the 2 study arms (p = 0.39).  Conclusions Short cycle 5 days on/2 days off intermittent ART was at least as effective as continuous therapy.

24751,Host factors in the pathogenesis of HIV disease,1996,Anthony S Fauci,48,,,4-12,Karger Publishers,A variety of viral and host factors contribute to the immunopathogenic mechanisms that determine the course of human immunodeficiency virus disease (fig. 1). Predominant among the viral factors are the replicative capacity of HIV as well as its pronounced tendency toward mutagenicity. A variety of host factors play an important role in the pathogenic mechanisms of HIV disease. Paramount among these are the specific immune response to the virus. However. a variety of other factors including aberrant cellular activation [reviewed in ref. 2] and dysreg-ulation of cytokine secretion [3] contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV disease. It is likely that all of these are genetically controlled to a greater or lesser extent. even though the genetic elements have not yet been identified. The purpose of the following discussion is to delineate several of these host factors and discuss their relationship to the pathogenic mechanisms of …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:8Xgff_V0N9gC,34,https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/425151,10671378508617828697,/scholar?cites=10671378508617828697,,,0

An average of 6.5%(+/-1.2% SE) of nucleated bone marrow cells formed spontaneous rosettes with sheep red blood cells. Functional T cells in bone marrow were also identified by characteristic responses to alloantigens and the T cell mitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA). The ability of three monoclonal antibodies (OKT. 3. Lyt-3. and (Leu-1) to lyse peripheral T cells in the presence of rabbit complement was examined. All three reagents were found to be specifically lytic for mature T cells in peripheral blood. One reagent (Leu-1) was selected for use in depletion of T cells in human bone marrow. Seven of 10 experiments performed showed sufficient T cell responses to be evaluable. In all of these experiments. a marked reduction of T cells and T cell functions was observed. On the average. E rosettes were reduced 89.2%(+/-3.0% SE) below medium controls while the mean PHA. Con A. and mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) activity were completely eliminated to levels below background. In four experiments. colony-forming units (CFU-GM) in bone marrow were assayed following treatment with Leu-1 and showed a mean increase of 194%(+/-32% SE) over medium controls.

This receptor mediates the immune adherence (IA) reaction. In this study. erythrocytes from over 100 normal donors and from donors with rare blood group types were examined for IA reactivity. All donors had red cells with high titer IA activity. with the exception of one Rh null individual whose erythrocytes had barely detectable IA activity. Five other RH null donors had normal IA titers. Because of the apparent defect in the expression of the red cell C3b receptor in this one individual. the mononuclear cell C3b receptors of this donor were studied and found to be normal.

The immunologic nature of the reaction was demonstrated by the fact that autologous targets were not lysed except when an agglutinin (PHA) was present during the cytotoxicity assay. Certain culture conditions were critical for optimal responses including the density of cells. the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol in the culture media. and certain batches of human AB serum which strongly supported the generation of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Cytotoxic cells were generated only after 2 to 3 days of culture and were not present at 24 hr or after 4 days of culture. The optimal concentration of Con A in the culture media was 10 to 20 µg/ml.

Lymphocytes from EBV-seronegative individuals lack the ability to suppress outgrowth of autologous EBV- transformed B lymphocytes. This capability appears during the course of primary EBV-induced infectious mononucleases (IM) as the atypical lymphocytosis is subsiding and persists for years after recovery from primary EBV infection. The ability of T lymphocytes from EBV- seropositive subjects or convalescent IM patients to inhibit B- lymphocyte outgrowth is not HLA restricted. Thus.

Although the chemokines that naturally bind CCR5 (CCL3/MIP-1α. CCL4/MIP- 1β. CCL5/RANTES) are major components of the CD8-derived anti-HIV activity. evidence indicates the existence of additional. still undefined. CD8-derived HIV-suppressive factors. Here. we report the characterization of a novel anti-HIV chemokine. XCL1/lymphotactin. a member of the C-chemokine family that is produced primarily by activated CD8+ T cells and behaves as a metamorphic protein. interconverting between two structurally distinct conformations (classic and alternative). We found that XCL1 inhibits a broad spectrum of HIV-1 isolates. irrespective of their coreceptor-usage phenotype. Experiments with stabilized variants of XCL1 demonstrated that HIV-1 inhibition requires access to the alternative. all-β conformation. which interacts with proteoglycans but does not bind/activate the specific XCR1 receptor. while the classic XCL1 conformation is inactive. HIV-1 inhibition by XCL1 was shown to occur at an early stage of infection. via blockade of viral attachment and entry into host cells. Analogous to the recently described anti-HIV effect of the CXC chemokine CXCL4/PF4. XCL1-mediated inhibition is associated with direct interaction of the chemokine with the HIV-1 envelope.

By employing a plaque-forming cell (PFC) assay for polyclonal activation of human B lymphocytes. it was demonstrated that dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (DB-cAMP) markedly increased the PFC response of pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-stimulated lymphocytes. Inducers of intracellular cAMP effected a comparable enhancement. Co-cultures of fresh lymphocytes with autologous T cells which had been pre-incubated with DB-cAMP produced an enhancement of B cell activation by a selective effect on the T cells.

The FcR distribution of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells consists of three distinct peaks. By analyzing cells fluorescently labeled with the 3A1. an anti‐T cell hybridoma antibody (using a green‐emitting fluorophore) and for FcR (with a red‐emitting fluorophore). and by using cell isolation procedures. it was shown that the cells lying within the peak with intermediate FcR density are mainly monocytes. while cells lying within the peaks with highest and lowest (i.e. negative) FcR densities are predominantly T cells. The FcR+ T cells (Tγ cells) express higher levels of the 3A1 antigen than other T cells. thus demonstrating the utility of the 3A1 hybridoma antibody as a marker for Tγ cells.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:RXiHnyRawswC,26,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eji.1830120605,682053597876647434,/scholar?cites=682053597876647434,,,0

During acute illness. a transient lymphopenia was noted which involved all lymphocyte subpopulations (thymus-and bone marrow-derived. and null cells). No circulating lymphocytotoxins were detected. and the lymphocytes remaining in the circulation responded normally to mitogenic stimuli. The acute lymphopenia occurred at the time that mononuclear cell infiltration of the jejunal mucosa has been noted.

The steady stream of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases since the 1960s has been a sobering wake-up call. Despite many accomplishments in the realm of antibiotics and vaccines. such a declaration of victory was not justified. It is now clearer than ever that the human species is in the midst of a war with the microbial world—a resilient foe that will never be completely defeated. 2-4 The AIDS pandemic illustrates how a new human pathogen emerged as a result of a complex series of opportunities that were presented to an unusual virus that first infected primates. 5 After the virus crossed over to humans. most likely as a …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:BJtnxTr0fRcC,24,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/199607,14932038043627509871,/scholar?cites=14932038043627509871,,,0

The issues of clinical trials and access to therapeutic drugs pose dilemmas for researchers. physicians. and AIDS patients and their families. Clinical trials are conducted for two related but separate purposes: definitive identification of which experimental drugs work and which do not (in scientifically controlled trials performed by clinical researchers); and to provide data as to whether drugs are safe and effective so that they can be licensed and made available (determined by the Federal Drug Administration).

24894,Immunopathogenic mechanisms in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections.,1988,Zeda F Rosenberg and Anthony S Fauci,546,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,,164-174,,Infection with HIV can result in a complex array of immunopathogenic effects. HIV infection involves both a direct quantitative depletion of T4 lymphocytes as well as an indirect qualitative effect on the function of several types of immune effector cells. The combination of T4-cell destruction and functional abnormalities contributes to the broad scope of immunologic aberrations and opportunistic diseases seen in HIV-infected individuals. In addition. HIV infection of monocyte/macrophages may play an important role as a reservoir or sanctuary of infection in the host and contribute to the characteristically long incubation period between HIV infection and disease. The activation of HIV from latent or chronically infected cells in vitro by mitogens. antigens. heterologous viruses. and cytokines represents a potential mechanism whereby HIV infection in individuals progresses from an asymptomatic carrier state to clinical AIDS. The release of virus from activated cells can lead to the spread of the virus to other target cells and result in both a qualitative or quantitative defect in immunocompetent cells and subsequent immunosuppression. It is also clear that HIV infection can result in the modulation of expression of certain cellular genes. thereby potentially compounding immunoregulatory abnormalities. Further knowledge of the complex relation between HIV and its target cells will be essential to our understanding of the myriad of potential pathogenic mechanisms of HIV infection and may lead to ways of interrupting the progression of HIV-induced disease.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:hefNtdE4IMkC,21,https://europepmc.org/article/med/3073694,3260610098084835988,/scholar?cites=3260610098084835988,,,0

24900,Achieving an AIDS-free world: science and implementation,2013,Anthony S Fauci and Hilary D Marston,155,Cell,4,733-734,Elsevier,When AIDS was first recognized in 1981. health professionals were ill equipped to address the emerging pandemic. Opportunistic infections were treated. and supportive care was provided in accordance with the regional availability of healthcare; however. even after HIV was recognized as the causative agent of AIDS. truly effective therapy would not be available for more than a decade. Prevention methods were similarly insufficient. as messages about safe sex and condoms often proved weaker than human impulse.But helplessness has now given way to hope. Basic and clinical scientific advances have yielded powerful therapeutic and preventive interventions. By the end of 2012. 9.7 million HIV-infected individuals worldwide were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). and some 4.2 million deaths had been averted during the previous decade in low-income and middle-income countries.

One such signature involves a reduced number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGs). This transmission signature underscores the importance of posttranslational modifications in the fitness of early-replicating isolates. An additional signature in Env involves the overrepresentation of basic amino acid residues at a specific position in the Env signal peptide (SP). In this report. we investigated the potential impact of this SP signature on gp120 glycosylation and antigenicity. Two recombinant gp120s were constructed. one derived from an isolate that lacks this signature and a second from an early-replicating isolate that includes this signature.

24938,Host factors that affect sexual transmission of HIV,1998,Oren J Cohen and Anthony S Fauci,2,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,4,182-185,Elsevier,One of the most complex issues regarding the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is that of sexual transmission. Sexual transmission of HIV is dependent on a number of variables that are operative in both the transmitting individual and the uninfected sexual partner. Although several recent studies have advanced the understanding of the factors that determine whether or not HIV is transmitted during a sexual encounter. more questions remain unanswered than answered.’Sexual transmission of HIV may occur when a sufficient amount of infectious virus penetrates the mucosa of the uninfected partner. Factors that increase the amount and virulence of virus delivered. that weaken the integrity of the local tissue barriers in the uninfected partner. or that hamper the generation of an effective local and systemic immune response in the uninfected partner would be expected to increase the likelihood of transmission. In this regard. the frequency and type of sexual encounter between the HIV-infected and uninfected partners are important determinants of transmission. The frequency of unprotected intercourse has been shown in many studies to bear a direct relation to the risk of transmission. 2 although the exact nature of the statistical relation is complex and apparently non-parametric3 The inherent fragility of the anorectal mucosa creates a predisposition to traumatic abrasion that explains the high-risk nature of unprotected anal intercourse. The presence of genital ulcerative disease also may enhance transmission of HIV by physical disruption of mucosal barriers and by recruitment and concentration of inflammatory cells …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:4n0clTBhZ78C,18,https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1276781.pdf,6652782863454449036,/scholar?cites=6652782863454449036,,https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1276781.pdf,0

Consequent damage to the gut plays a central role in HIV pathogenesis. The basis for preferential targeting of gut tissues is not well defined. Recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides derived from HIV and SIV gp120 bind directly to integrin α4β7. a gut-homing receptor. Using both cell-surface expressed α4β7 and a soluble α4β7 heterodimer we demonstrate that its specific affinity for gp120 is similar to its affinity for MAdCAM (its natural ligand). The gp120 V2 domain preferentially engages extended forms of α4β7 in a cation -sensitive manner and is inhibited by soluble MAdCAM. Thus. V2 mimics MAdCAM in the way that it binds to α4β7. providing HIV a potential mechanism to discriminate between functionally distinct subsets of lymphocytes. including those with gut-homing potential. Furthermore. α4β7 antagonists developed for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. block V2 binding to α4β7. A 15-amino acid V2 -derived peptide is sufficient to mediate binding to α4β7. It includes the canonical LDV/I α4β7 binding site. a cryptic epitope that lies 7–9 amino acids amino terminal to the LDV/I. and residues K169 and I181. These two residues were identified in a sieve analysis of the RV144 vaccine trial as sites of vaccine -mediated immune pressure.

It has been suggested that platelet AP4A is stored in the dense granules and is metabolically inactive. We have studied the AP4A content of blood platelets in two patients and three cattle with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS). a hereditary platelet defect with dense granule deficiency. Acid-soluble extractions of whole blood and platelets were neutralized. The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level was measured by luminescence technique. To measure the AP4A content. the neutralized extract was treated with phosphomonoesterase for removal of ATP. The AP4A content was then measured by coupling the phosphodiesterase and luciferase reaction. The AP4A content was 0.43 nmol/mg protein for normal human platelets and 0.004 nmol/mg protein for CHS platelets.

All of this conveys an important lesson. All patients are different. and their diseases behave differently. Rarely do patients fit all the criteria for a textbook diagnosis. We must “practice” on them. This is not accomplished by erratic trial-and-error procedures. Rather. we learn through our collective experience as medical practitioners. and what we learn by either succeeding or failing saves subsequent lives. Even at this point in my career.

It has been proposed that DCs are more efficiently infected with M-tropic versus T-tropic viruses; however. the infectability of DCs and the relevance of their infectability for inducing productive infection is controversial.

Given the cohort’s mean number of HIV-expressing cells per area of lymphoid tissue (72 cells per 100 mm2). decay curves revealed that 83 days of treatment would be necessary to abolish detectable viremia.

24999,Mitral stenosis,1997,EUGENE Braunwald,,"Heart Disease. Braunwald E, 5th Ed. p1009, Philadelphia, WB Saunders Co",,,,PATHOPHYSIOLOGY In normal adults the mitral valve orifice is 4 to 6 cm:. In the presence of significant obstruction. ie. when the orifice is less than one-half of normal. blood can flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle only if propelled by an abnormally elevated left atrioventricular pressure gradient; such a gradient is the hemodynamic hallmark of mitral stenosis. When the mitral valve opening is reduced to 1 cm2. a left atrial pressure of approximately 25 mmHg is required to maintain a normal cardiac output. The elevated left atrial pressure in turn raises pulmonary venous and capillary pressures. resulting in exertional dyspnea. The first bouts of dyspnea are usually precipitated by an increased rate of blood flow across the mitral orifice. which results in further elevation of the left atrial pressure. In order to assess the severity of obstruction. it is essential to measure the transvalvular pressure gradient and flow rate. The latter is dependent not only on the cardiac output but on the heart rate as well. An increase in heart rate shortens diastole proportionately more than systole. and diminishes the time available for flow across the mitral valve. Therefore. at any given level of cardiac output tachycardia augments the transvalvular gradient and elevates left atrial pressure. The left ventricular diastolic pressure is normal in pure mitral stenosis; coexisting mitral regurgitation. aortic valve disease. the residua of damage produced by rheumatic myocarditis. systemic hypertension. or ischemic heart disease may be responsible for elevations which reflect impaired left ventricular function and/or reduced left ventricular compliance.

25009,Vasculitis: New insights amid old enigmas,1979,Anthony S Fauci,67,The American journal of medicine,6,916-918,Elsevier,T he vasculitic syndromes encompass a broad spectrum of diseases with the common denominator of an inflammatory and often necrotic process of the blood vessels themselves [I]. Vessels of various types (arteries. veins. capillaries). sizes and locations may be involved within the same syndrome. or a particular pattern may be expressed almost exclusively in a given disease. In addition. the vasculitic process may be the predominant or even sole manifestation of disease (systemic necrotizing vasculitis of the polyarteritis nodosa type). or it may be a part of another underlying primary disease (vasculitis associated with certain connective tissue tlisensesj. Whatever the clinical setting. the prevailing clinically and pathologically relevant manifestation of the vasculitic process is the resulting tissue ischemia. One of the major difficulties which clinicians have faced over the years in the understanding of the numcrous vasculitic syndromes has been the complex. cvcr-changing and often contradictory classifications which have appeared [reviewed in [l]). This may have been only of academic interest to physicians years ago when few. if any. effective therapeutic modalities existed for these diseases. However. with the advent of well-documented reports of dramatic long-term remissions with the use of cytotoxic agents. particularly cyclophosphamide. with or without corticosteroids in certain life-threatening vasculitides such as Wegener’s granulomatosis[2. 3] and severe systemic necrotizing vasculitis [4-61. understanding of recently emphasized criteria for more appropriate classification of the vasculitidcs is essential.

25037,Acute flaccid myelitis: something old and something new,2019,David M Morens and Gregory K Folkers and Anthony S Fauci,10,MBio,2,,American Society for Microbiology,Since 2014. acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). a long-recognized condition associated with polioviruses. nonpolio enteroviruses. and various other viral and nonviral causes. has been reemerging globally in epidemic form. This unanticipated reemergence is ironic. given that polioviruses. once the major causes of AFM. are now at the very threshold of global eradication and cannot therefore explain any aspect of AFM reemergence. Instead. the new AFM epidemic has been temporally associated with reemergences of nonpolio enteroviruses such as EV-D68. until recently thought to be an obscure virus of extremely low endemicity. This perspective reviews the enigmatic epidemiologic. virologic. and diagnostic aspects of epidemic AFM reemergence; examines current options for clinical management; discusses future research needs; and suggests that the AFM epidemic offers important clues to mechanisms of viral …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:MagRZZew-58C,12,https://mbio.asm.org/content/10/2/e00521-19.abstract,2426984446427647547,/scholar?cites=2426984446427647547,,https://mbio.asm.org/content/mbio/10/2/e00521-19.full.pdf,0

VRC01-Rh-α4β7-treated macaques had fewer IL-17-producing cells in the blood and the gut during the acute phase of infection. Moreover. higher T cell responses to the V2-loop of the SHIVAD8-EO envelope in the VRC01-Rh-α4β7 group inversely correlated with set point viremia. The combination of suboptimal amounts of VRC01 and Rh-α4β7 delayed infection. altered antiviral immune responses and minimized CD4+ T cell loss. Further exploration of the effect of combining bNAbs with Rh-α4β7 on SIV/HIV infection and antiviral immune responses is warranted and may lead to novel preventive and therapeutic strategies.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:ouq6-fJ2VSQC,11,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007776,16159661284720271923,/scholar?cites=16159661284720271923,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007776,0

Specific antibody responses induced with the antigen are suppressed by the addition of 4F2. However. specific antibody responses induced with the polyclonal activator. pokeweed mitogen (PWM). are significantly enhanced by the addition of 4F2. Proliferative responses to both antigen and PWM are suppressed by the addition of 4F2. The enhancement of PWM stimulated responses by 4F2 is mediated by T cells. However. in the absence of T cells. 4F2 can directly inhibit antigen specific B cells. Polyclonal Ig production stimulated by PWM was also enhanced by 4F2.

A marked enhancement of Ig secretion was observed in unstimulated cultures in the presence of HC as compared to cultures without HC. The augmented response was not due to a direct induction of Ig secretion by HC. but resulted from an enhancement or unveiling of the background mitogenic signal provided by the supplemental serum used in culture. HC-induced augmentation of Ig secretion was only seen in unstimulated cultures performed in fetal calf serum (FCS) which is known to possess mitogenic properties. In contrast.

T Mcells are selectively depleted from the circulation by in vivoadministration of glucocorticosteroids as opposed to T Gcells which are relatively resistant to the lymphodepletive effects of these hormones. However. this selective lymphodepletive effect of glucocorticosteroids on T Mcells could not be explained on the basis of detectable differences in intracytoplasmic glucocorticosteroid receptors in these T-cell subpopulations since T Gand T Mcells had quantitatively similar glucocorticosteroid receptors as well as remarkably similar dexamethasone binding affinities and dissociation constants.

25095,Cytokine cascades in HIV infection,1996,Guido Poli and Anthony S Fauci,,,,285-301,Springer. Boston. MA,Since the recognition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) as the causative agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). the search to unravel the viral and cellular factors controlling its replicative ability has become an important goal of both basic and applied research. Cellular transcription factors. such as NF-κB. as well as viral proteins may activate HIV transcription in cells latently infected with HIV. In this regard. certain studies indicate that latent infection is the predominant virological state of infected cells in vivo (Embretson et al.. 1993). although a fraction of cells express virus in lymphoid organs throughout the entire course of disease (Pantaleo et al.. 1993). In addition. plasma viremia can be detected throughout the entire course of HIV disease (Piatak et al.. 1993). Furthermore. both HIV and CD4+ T lymphocytes (the predominant target of HIV infection) rapidly turn over …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:2hlgnPHlchoC,10,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-0191-0_14,11957317414561101499,/scholar?cites=11957317414561101499,,,0

T4+ cells functioned as helper cells in both antigen-driven and PWM-driven cultures in a dose-dependent manner. Whereas T8+ cells suppress both total and specific immunoglobulin secretion in PWM-stimulated cultures. in antigen-stimulated cultures T8+ cells do not suppress unless activated by another cell population present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC).

Most patients with AIDS-related pulmonary disease present with the subacute onset of fever. cough. and dyspnea often in the context of other clinical findings that suggest infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)[l]. Clinicians must be alert to uncommon presentations of AIDS that may occur. particularly in patients who do not have apparent risk factors for infection with HIV. In the current report. we describe an atypical pulmonary presentation of AIDS that was associated with unusual histopathologic findings of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.CASE REPORT A &year-old white female computer programmer received blood transfusions in 1981 during hospitalization for a hysterectomy. Four years later. she presented with an eight-month history of progressive dyspnea on exertion. Fever and cough were absent and the patient had not lost weight. There were no significant environmental. occupational. or pharmacologic exposures. Results of physical examination revealed bilateral dry rales but were otherwise normal. Diffuse interstitial infiltrates were seen on a chest radiograph. and diffuse bilateral gallium uptake was present in the lungs on gallium radioisotope scan.

Boston. MA,Efforts to evaluate normal human B cell physiology have resulted in the development of a model in which a resting B cell must progress through stages of activation. proliferation. and differentiation before becoming an immunoglobulin (Ig)-producing cell (1–4). Presumably each of these stages has specific signals. positive as well as negative. which control the nature as well as the intensity of the response. To evaluate the validity of this model. researchers have looked for reagents which act selectively at each of these stages. These include antigens. mitogens. soluble factors produced by various cell types. and various pharmacologic agents.

During this time cells that actively express HIV and cells that harbor the virus in a latent form have been demonstrated in different tissues and organs of infected individuals. It is critical to delineate the cellular and/or viral factors that regulate HIV expression and latency in order to fully understand the pathogenic mechanisms of HIV disease. Among several in vitro models that have been developed since HIV has been recognized as a human pathogen. the chronically infected promonocytic cell line U1 has become one of the more broadly used surrogate models for studies of immunologic and molecular regulation of HIV expression.

Analysis of activation and proliferation.,1982,JS Smolen and ES Raveche and RT Steinberg and SO Sharrow and AS Fauci and AD Steinberg,9,Journal of Clinical & Laboratory Immunology,3,185-192,,In this study. we have used cell cycle analysis as an independent measure of proliferation and the 4F2 marker to enumerate activated T cells. T-cell proliferation increased gradually throughout the 7-day culture. The degree of proliferation correlated very strongly (r= 0. 827. p less than 10 (-4)) with the degree of T-cell activation as demonstrated by the expression of the 4F2 marker. However. many more T cells became activated during the AMLR than were proliferating. Thymidine incorporation correlated well (r= 0.956. p less than 10 (-4)) with numbers of proliferating cells as determined by cell cycle analysis. Adherent cells (M phi) induced fewer T cells to express 4F2 and to proliferate than did (B+ null) cells. However. proportionately. M phi induced much more activation than proliferation in comparison to (B+ null) cells. Additional analyses of cell cycle and the 4F2 marker for activated cells indicated that a very small percentage of responder T cells (less than 1%) respond initially to signals from autologous non-T cells. Moreover. there is a three-day delay before substantial proliferation and activation takes place. providing time for amplification and suppressive regulatory processes. Ultimately. between 5 and 30% of the initial T cells are capable of proliferating in the AMLR and up to 90% of the cells may become activated. Thus. many cells become activated (and are therefore capable of secreting immune regulatory factors or otherwise participating in immune responses) than proliferate. These results provide a basis for analysing defects in the AMLR in association with various disease states.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:xii_ZKWM4-0C,8,https://europepmc.org/article/med/6220155,5310860545665607937,/scholar?cites=5310860545665607937,,,0

Edward Arnold Publishers, London",,431-451,,It is known that hormones exert a significant modulatory influence on inflammatory and immune responses of animals and human beings. These hormonal effects are best understood with regard to the glucocorticoids. but a substantial amount of information concerning the immunoregulatory effects of other hormones has been accumulated in recent years. This chapter reviews some of the current information concerning the impact of hormones on inflammatory and immune responses. Distinctions between in vivo and in vitro systems and between human and animal studies are emphasized. concentrating on those phenomena that most likely reflect human in vivo mechanisms. The chapter is divided into sections focusing on certain of the divergent aspects of the subject:(1) receptor theories of hormone action.(2) relevant differences between animal versus human and in vivo versus in vitro assays of hormone function.(3) effects of glucocorticoids on leukocyte traffic.(4) effects of glucocorticoids on leukocyte function.(5) effects of glucocorticoids on the humoral factors involved in immune and inflammatory responses. and (6) significant advances in the study of the effects of other hormones on inflammatory and immunologic reactions.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:It0W0vAlS5QC,8,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10288727886846408121&hl=en&oi=scholarr,10288727886846408121,/scholar?cites=10288727886846408121,,,0

By a variety of purification procedures. it was demonstrated to be a lymphocyte with surface characteristics of a B cell. Furthermore. it was demonstrated to bind to sheep erythrocytes (E) and thus segregated with the E-rosetting T cells when T cell enrichment was performed by differential fractionation of E-rosetting cells. This binding of the PFC precursor to E was blocked by pretreating the lymphocyte with anti-human Ig before E rosetting. indicating that the PFC precursor specifically bound to SRBC by a surface Ig molecule with binding specificity for sheep red blood cell determinants.

Inc,There are a number of culture and assay systems which have been employed over recent years in the study of human B lymphocyte function. These have included the culture of mononuclear cells in the presence and absence of various mitogenic or antigenic stimuli and the measurement of immunoglobulin (Ig) and/or antibody production by a variety of techniques. Most commonly these have been the demonstration by fluorescence techniques of intracytoplasmic (Ig) in differ—entiated B cells or plasma cells following stimulation of lymphocyte cultures with polyclonal lymphocyte activators such as pokeweed mitogen (PWM)(Cooper. et al.. 1971). Other systems have employed the measurement of Ig or antibody in culture supernatants by a variety of techniques such as hemagglutination. incorporation of labelled amino acids into Ig molecules (Choi et al.. 1972) and various radioimmuno-assays of Ig or antibody (Waldmann et al.. 1974). As in most systems. each of these techniques has their advantages and disadvantages. In general. many of them are difficult and tedious to perform. We have recently developed and have been utilizing a new method for measuring in vitro antibody production by human B lymphocytes (Fauci and Pratt. 1976a; Fauci and Pratt. 1976b).

Unfortunately. concomitant with this favorable outcome. noninfectious causes of morbidity and mortality. particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD). have had a disproportionately negative affect on ART-treated individuals with HIV. creating a “double jeopardy” phenomenon. Shortly after recognizing the benefits of combination ART in suppressing HIV replication. restoring immune function. and prolonging life. physicians raised concerns about possible undesired toxicities of the therapy.

Volume,,,,Immunity is intrinsic to life and an important tool in the fight for survival against pathogenic microorganisms. The human immune system can be divided into two major components: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system (see Chap. 314). The innate immune system provides the rapid triggering of inflammatory responses based on the recognition (at the cell surface or within cells) of either molecules expressed by microorganisms or molecules that serve as “danger signals” released by cells under attack. These receptor/ligand interactions trigger signaling events that ultimately lead to inflammation. Virtually all cell lineages (not just immune cells) are involved in innate immune responses; however. myeloid cells (ie. neutrophils and macrophages) play a major role because of their phagocytic capacity. The adaptive immune system operates by clonal recognition of antigens followed by a dramatic …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:cKQgJgBA5EIC,7,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5054464916706955482&hl=en&oi=scholarr,5054464916706955482,/scholar?cites=5054464916706955482,,,0

In this paper. we characterize three of the four divisions; the Northern Plains. the Deccan Plateau. and the Northern Mountains or the Himalayan as regions with dissimilar climatic and physical resources. It is argued that human adaptations to these variations would be varied by differences in social organization of production and consumption resulting in differences in fertility differences across the three divisions. We found significant differences in the median age at motherhood as well as in the total family size. The effects of the three selected fertility determinants. age at marriage. years of woman's education. and level of child loss on family size also varied significantly across the three divisions.

While the United States had abandoned the development of biological weapons in 1972. it was sobering to learn that the Soviet Union had not. and. in fact. continued to produce vast stores of smallpox and other potential agents of bioterrorism.

These individuals have been designated as ‘long term non-progressors’(LTNPs). From a virologic standpoint. these LTNPs have low viral burden in mononuclear cells. but persistent virus replication as manifested by chronic and generally low levels of plasma viremia. From an immunologic standpoint. immune functions including CD8+ T-cell-and CD4+ T-cell-mediated functions are preserved. In addition. they show a vigorous humoral immune response. More importantly. lymphoid tissue structure and function are preserved in LTNPs.

No detectable enhancing effect on B-cell proliferation was noted when 2.5% T cells were purposely added back to culture. a proportion far in excess of that which might be expected to contaminate B-cell suspensions under the present methodology. In contrast. when 10% T cells were added back to B-cell cultures. an enhanced proliferation of B cells was observed suggesting that the lack of effect of lower numbers of T cells was due to their inefficiency in helping B-cell proliferation in …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:B2rIPIGFPLEC,7,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000887498590259X,15332170593266026565,/scholar?cites=15332170593266026565,,,0

MC O'Donnell. Ph. D. SJ Ackerman. Ph. D. GJ Gleich. MD. and LL Thomas. Ph. D.. Rochester. MN and Chicago. IL. Systemic or local tissue eosinophilia is a frequent characteristic of allergic reactions. Observed in association with eosinophilia are elevated serum or tissue levels of major basic protein (MBP). a primary constituent of eosinophi1 granules. Since polymers of basic amino acids can induce histamine release from human leukocytes. we evaluated MBP purified from human eosinophil granules for similar activit Native MBP at concentrations of 5 x 10-7-M-7.5 x 10-6 M induced up to 80% histamine release in a concentration-dependent fashion from human leukocytes. Kinetic studies indicated that release increased with time for approximately 40 min; half maximum secretion occurred at approximately 17 min. Reduced and alkylated MBP exhibited diminished potency and efficacy. Release caused by optimal concentrations of native MBP was inhibited in the presence of 4mM EDTA or 3mM Z-deoxy-D-glucose. That native MBP induced histamine release by a direct effect on basophils was confirmed using preparations of pure (92-96%) human basophils. Similar concentrations of native MBP also stimulated concentration-dependent histamine release (up to 40-602) from purified rat mast cells in a manner analogous to other polycations. These results demonstrate that native MBP induces non-lytic histamine release from human basophils. and also rat mast cells. and suggest that MBP release from …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:SC9kKMAi-DoC,7,https://www.jacionline.org/article/0091-6749(83)90324-X/pdf,4232447418221731565,/scholar?cites=4232447418221731565,,https://www.jacionline.org/article/0091-6749(83)90324-X/pdf,0

Methods and materials: A case-control study was conducted in 2011 to investigate risk factors associated with preeclampsia in Gaza Strip. A total of 54 cases of preeclampsia were ascertained at four primary health care centers based on criteria defined by the World Health Organization. The study population included 162 pregnant women (54 cases and 108 controls). Results: Previous history of preeclampsia (OR= 6.74. 95%. CI 2.89 to 15.72). hypertension (6.63. 1.29 to 34.03). maternal age exceeding 35 years (4.9. 2.07 to 11.60) and education< 9 years were significantly associated with increased risk of preeclampsia. Moreover. young mothers (1.36. 0.37 to 5.04). primigravida (1.54. 0.70 to 3.35). pregnant with family history (1.95. 0.94 to 4.07). obese (2.01. 0.89 to 4.51) and diabetic pregnant women (2.04. 0.28 to 14.88) were more prone to develop preeclampsia. Living within an extended family. maternal education exceeding 9 years and maternal age between 18 and 35 years were protective factors. No statistical relationship could be concluded between maternal occupation and multiple pregnancy. and preeclampsia development. Conclusion: Previous and family history of preeclampsia. dietary related chronic diseases (obesity. diabetes mellitus and essential hypertension). being primigravida and increasing maternal age are risk factors that increased the risk of development of preeclampsia.

25243,Preface: Evolving ethical issues over the course of the AIDS pandemic,2012,Anthony S Fauci,34,Public Health Reviews,1,1-6,BioMed Central,In the early years of the AIDS pandemic. one of the major ethical considerations facing frontline AIDS medical researchers was the issue of patient accessibility to clinical trials. This issue loomed large because at the time. there were no licensed antiretroviral drugs to treat people with the disease. there were only experimental drugs being tested in clinical trials.1 Clearly. the standard approach to the design of clinical trials—that is. rigid eligibility criteria as well as the strict regulatory aspects that attend clinical trial investigations and drug approval—was not well-suited to a novel. largely fatal disease such as this with no effective treatments. and we had many intense discussions about how to make that approach more flexible and ethically sound. One example. which I and others worked closely with the AIDS activists to develop. was called a parallel track for clinical trials. The parallel track concept. which the United States Food and Drug Administration ultimately came to support. meant that there would be the standard type of highly controlled admission criteria and data collection for the clinical trial of a particular drug. In parallel. however. the drug also could be made available to those who did not meet the trial’s strict admission criteria but were still in dire need of any potentially effective intervention. however unproven. for this deadly disease. So that to me was a prevailing ethical issue in the early years of the AIDS pandemic—the need to re-examine the justification or not of the rigidity and exclusivity of our clinical trial process. The ultimate resolution of the dilemma was to create this parallel track approach where you could be more flexible in …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:JkxM1axsR-IC,6,https://publichealthreviews.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/BF03391654,13039827251611368411,/scholar?cites=13039827251611368411,,https://publichealthreviews.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1007/BF03391654,0

25252,Promethean thymus?,1998,Mark Dybul and Audrey Kinter and Margaret Ruiz and Anthony S Fauci,101,The Journal of Clinical Investigation,11,2299-2300,American Society for Clinical Investigation,The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) 1 has engendered much hope for individuals with HIV infection. Such treatment often substantially reduces viral burden with a resulting increase in peripheral CD4 T cell counts (1). However. it remains unclear whether this increase in circulating T cells represents a functional reconstitution of the damaged immune system. The thymus is central to this issue. In T cell ontogeny. progenitor cells from the bone marrow migrate to the thymus where they mature and are selected for release into the periphery as naive (CD45RA CD62L) cells.

Standard therapy for PE has employed heparin anticoagulation followed by warfarin. without thrombolytic therapy. The rationale for anticoagulation therapy is to provide prophylaxis against additional thromboembolic events while natural fibrinolytic mechanisms gradually lyse the previously formed pulmonary artery clot. In contrast. the rationale for thrombolytic therapy (followed by anticoagulation) is that thrombolysis actively dissolves clot that has already formed. thereby restoring cardiopulmonary function to normal as quickly as possible.

Lymphocytes mediating specific lysis of target cells bearing the stimulating alloantigens (CTL) could clearly be distinguished from cells mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in that CTL were FcγR− while cells mediating ADCC were FcγR+. In contrast. MLC-generated natural killer (NK) cells were distributed in both the FcγR− and FcγR+ cell fractions. The presence or absence of Ia antigens did not correlate with any of the cytolytic activities studied. In addition. FcγR− and not FcγR+ cells responded in the secondary MLC.

VRC01 has proven to be effective in neutralizing diverse strains of HIV in vitro and in animal models and has the capacity to suppress plasma viremia in infected individuals4. However. the ability of VRC01 to suppress plasma viral rebound in HIV-infected patients following cessation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains unclear.Methods: An exploratory. open-label clinical trial was conducted to examine the effect of passive transfer of VRC01 on plasma viral rebound following discontinuation of ART in HIV-infected individuals who initiated treatment during the chronic phase of infection and who suppressed plasma viremia> 3 years with CD4+ T cell count> 450 cells/mm3 at enrollment. Subjects received VRC01 (40mg/kg) 3 days prior to and 14 and 28 days following interruption of ART. and monthly thereafter for up to 6 months. Levels of plasma viremia and VRC01 were measured at day-7.-3. 0. 3. 7. 14. 21. and 28 and biweekly thereafter. In addition. the capacity of VRC01 and other bNAbs to neutralize autologous infectious HIV prior to and following infusions of the antibody was examined.Results: Ten subjects were enrolled in the study. Mean duration of ART was 10.6 years. Mean CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts at baseline were 796 and 768/mm3. respectively. Multiple infusions of VRC01 were safe and well tolerated. Ten of ten subjects experienced plasma viral rebound (> 40 copies/ml) between 11-86 days (median 39 …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:MWSB05WFU5AC,5,https://www.croiconference.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/posters/2016/311LB.pdf,13171633998086180411,/scholar?cites=13171633998086180411,,https://www.croiconference.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/posters/2016/311LB.pdf,0

25288,About Harrison,2014,WI Harrison,19,Principios de Medicina interna,,,,Alana Harrison L. Shipp Lit & Comp 8 May 2020 Destiny Frasqueri. the Princess of New York Underdogs. Destiny Nicole Frasqueri is a boisterous New Yorker who uses music to show an elevation of knowledge and life. At sixteen. Destiny decided to abscond from an abusive foster home in East Harlem with “three dollars in my pocket and 75% on my cell phone battery’for a life on the streets”(Petridis). She produced music on SoundCloud under the name Wavy Spice with heavily praised tracks such as.‘I’m Posh’and ‘Yaya.’As the attractions grew for the songs. the more record labels reached out. and the more Frasqueri’s distaste for the corporate side of the music industry grew. This response led Destiny back to New York where.“She changed her stage name to Princess Nokia. after the brand of cheap Obama phone’and shifted increasingly towards hip-hop”(Petridis). But for Nokia something was missing. so she reverted to her roots and released a “bright. optimistic. feminist. socially conscious. and filled with a lot of souls” mixtape called ‘Honeysuckle’under the name Destiny. This was where she was able to compose a lasting image and truly shows herself through music with lines like.“I'm one hell of a woman. I am. I come from the ghetto. The slums. Sure. it's beautiful. but it's rough. And it can get'ya. I lost every guardian I had before the age of nine and I did not live with my parents. I was in foster care”(Intro). Destiny was putting herself out in the world regardless of what any critiques were. and that’s what feminism is. Not long after the release of ‘Honeysuckle. Destiny decided she would triumphantly carry the title.

Through prolonged and sustained suppression of HIV replication. ART can dramatically improve the clinical outcome of infected individuals and significantly reduce rates of morbidity and mortality in countries where drugs are accessible [1]. Despite this extraordinary achievement. it has not been possible to eradicate HIV in infected individuals by ART alone. as exemplified by prompt rebounding of plasma viremia following discontinuation of therapy [2] and compelling data that persistent viral reservoirs are present in virtually all aviremic infected individuals receiving ART [3–5]. These sobering observations have consequently dimmed the prospects for achieving sustained virologic remission in the absence of …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:o0tJHVzi6PsC,5,https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/208/9/1356/2193532,3489671207472725008,/scholar?cites=3489671207472725008,,https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/208/9/1356/2193532,0

HIV/AIDS remains an incurable disease that is devastating large swaths of our country and the rest of the world. To understand the magnitude of the destruction. look around our nation's capital. Last month. DC health officials announced that 3 percent of city residents had full-blown AIDS or were infected with HIV. Not only is that infection rate on a par with rates in some African countries. but the DC data were based only on those who have been tested for HIV; the actual rate is probably much higher. Globally. an estimated 33 million people carry the virus. In 2007 alone. about 2.7 million new infections occurred.The annual number of new HIV infections in the United States--about 56.000--has remained fairly constant for more than a decade.

Because laboratory findings are generally nonspecific. the diagnosis is usually based on the combination of typical histopathology and compatible clinical features. Certain infectious agents that cause a granulomatous response. such as mycobacteria and fungi. can mimic clinicopathologic features of Wegener's granulomatosis. especially in the lung; therefore. a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis should not be made without examining special stains and culture results (Leavitt and Fauci.

25334,Characterization of the cellular immune response following in vivo immunization with pneumococcal polysaccharides in man.,1983,JH Kehrl and AS Fauci,19,Bulletin Europeen de Physiopathologie Respiratoire,2,227-234,,The in vivo and in vitro immune responses following in vivo immunization with pneumococcal polysaccharides (PPS) has been analyzed in man. Within 6 days following immunization. specific PPS antigen-binding cells (ABC). specific plaque-forming cells (PFC) and cells capable of spontaneously synthesizing in vitro substantial amounts of specific anti-PPS IgG and IgA and lesser amounts of specific IgM appeared in the peripheral blood. The ABC. PFC and total amounts of specific spontaneous antibody production in vitro followed nearly identical kinetics after immunization. The ABC were isolated and shown to be large B cells. predominantly surface IgG positive and surface IgD negative. and to express an activation antigen called 4F2. Low doses of in vitro irradiation markedly inhibited spontaneous anti-PPS antibody production by lymphocytes obtained 7 or 8 days after immunization. suggesting a requirement for in vitro proliferation for full expression in vitro of antibody secretion following in vivo activation. Spontaneous secretion by B lymphocytes in vitro was independent of T cells. unmodified by the addition of T cell factors. and readily suppressible by pokeweed mitogen (PWM). These findings strongly suggest that the in vivo immunization with PPS delivered to these spontaneously secreting PPS-specific B cells the signals for proliferation as well as differentiation. both of which were expressed in vitro. By 2 weeks after immunization. spontaneous anti-PPS antibody production in vitro was no longer detected. Subsequent stimulation of lymphocytes with a wide range of concentrations of specific antigen did not trigger either proliferation or …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:tgTmbKTkO1IC,5,https://europepmc.org/article/med/6347283,8902224403440022855,/scholar?cites=8902224403440022855,,,0

The efficacy of corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of immune complex-mediatic diseases is likely to be multifactorial. Each agent can intervene at several different points in the scheme of immune complex injury. Thus. these agents may act by preventing the formation and/or tissue localization of the complex or may suppress the inflammatory response to it once deposition has occurred. It should be remembered. however. that many of the proposed means of modifying immune complex-mediated injury are theoretical and based on knowledge of the pharmacological activity of a drug or its known effects in experimental animals.

This is understandable. and I am not suggesting that it should be eliminated because it is still a critical structure for delivering patient care.

This document offers a valuable reappraisal of how we can best move this critical area of research forward to help achieve our ultimate goal of eliminating tuberculosis worldwide. The new Blueprint builds on more than 10 years of exceptional progress in TB science and product development since the 2000 publication of the first Blueprint. which resulted from a workshop organized by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). For a research field that began to receive serious attention and commitment of substantial resources only in the mid-1990s. remarkable gains have been achieved. The framework laid out in the original Blueprint for creating a sustainable infrastructure for the clinical development of candidate TB vaccines is updated in the current plan to reflect new knowledge gained from studying multiple vaccine candidates in preclinical studies and human clinical trials. This update will enable us to refine our approach and define research gaps that must be filled if we are to make licensure of new TB vaccines a reality. The NIH welcomes the publication of the 2012 Blueprint. and we look forward to continuing to work with the many committed scientists and our public and private partners in the global effort to control and ultimately end the global TB pandemic.TB control programs have led to a recent worldwide decline in the number of people falling ill and dying from TB.

25362,Commentary on fatalities in the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic,2009,Edwin D Kilbourne,199,J Infect Dis,,913,,To the Editor—After the first pandemic in the age of modern virology in 1957. a symposium entitled “Virus Virulence and Pathogenicity” that was devoted chiefly to influenza was held at the Ciba Foundation headquarters in London in 1959. At this meeting. I presented a paper entitled “The Severity of Influenza as a Reciprocal of Host Susceptibility”[1]. in which I described the experience at New York Hospital. where most fatalities occurred either in patients previously compromised by cardiopulmonary problems related to rheumatic heart disease or physiologic changes in the third trimester of pregnancy or in patients with secondary bacterial pneumonia [2]. This experience was similar to that of other teaching hospitals at the time. I was struck by the fact that. in my laboratory. influenza virus isolated from persons with fatal cases differed in no discernible way—including virulence in mice—from virus recovered from those with nonfatal cases of brief duration [3].The best documented fact of 1918–1919 is that all but a few who died of “influenza” died with. if not of. secondary bacterial pneumonia. I wrote at the time.“The virus of 1918 was undoubtedly uniquely virulent. although most patients experienced symptoms of typical influenza with a 3-to 5-day fever followed by complete recovery. Nevertheless. although diagnostic virology was not yet available. bacteriology was flourishing and many careful post-mortem examinations of patients by academic bacteriologists and pathologists disclosed bacterial pathogens in the lungs”[4. p. 9].

The T4÷ cells. characterized by the presence of CD4 molecules on the surface. are responsible for inducing a wide range of immunologic responses that include immunoglobulin production. cytotoxic and suppressor cell functions. and lymphoid and nonlymphoid factor secretion (2). Thus. impairment of the T4+ cell population can have a global effect on immune function.A range of B-lymphocyte abnormalities. including elevated spontaneous immunoglobulin secretion and proliferation. have also been described in acquired immunodeficiency …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:vjZqxyZ7hS4C,4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0197185988900581,15698339470960369980,/scholar?cites=15698339470960369980,,,0

25385,Immunopathogenesis of HTLV-III/LAV infection,1987,Joseph B Margolick and H Clifford Lane and Anthony S Fauci,,,,59-79,Alan R. Liss New York,The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the human retrovirus termed human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-III or lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV). This virus has the extraordinary property of selective tropism for a specific subset of T lymphocytes termed helper or inducer T cells defined by the T4 or Leu 3 phenotypic marker. Infection of the T4+ subset results in a cytopathic effect on the target cell. Since this subset is responsible for the induction of a wide range of immunologic functions. a broad range of immunologic abnormalities ensues. The immunologic defect is manifested by both quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in T4+ cell functions. Of note is the fact that there is a selective and early defect in the subset of T4 cells which is responsible for antigen recognition. Furthermore. abnormalities in antigen-presenting cells (monocyte/macrophages) compound the defect in response to specific antigens. The presence of additional abnormalities of monocytes likely reflects the infection of these cells with the HTLV-III/LAV. B cells are also abnormal in that they are polyclonally activated and defective in their response to de novo antigens.

The mortality rate from this complication of CGD is estimated at 27%. Treatment has consisted of extensive surgical debridement and drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy; however. this approach is accompanied by high morbidity and the frequent need for reoperation. Successful percutaneous drainage of multiple hepatic abscesses in a patient who had previously undergone 10 operative procedures to manage hepatic abscesses is reported.

25389,Mucosal immunity,1985,John I Gallin,4,,,,Raven Pr,Mucosal immunity is an important subspecialty of the study of infectious diseases that has profound importance for both basic and clinical scientists as well as for clinicians. Yet. until recently it had received relatively little attention in terms of clinical investigation. largely because of the complexity of the systems involved. This volume contains chapters covering major areas in the field. The first three chapters provide state-of-the-art reviews of the cellular and humoral components of mucosal immunity. The reviews by Strober and Jacobs and Tomasi and Plaut address the cellular and humoral defenses. and the review by Abraham and Beachey considers mechanisms of bacterial attachment to mucosal surfaces and host reactions to bacteria. The next three chapters focus on pulmonary host defenses. The chapters on specific cellular factors. by Hunninghake and colleagues. and humoral factors. by Rankin and Reynolds. provide background information. whereas Pennington's review on the effects of immunosuppression on pulmonary defenses is particularly relevant for clinicians. The final chapter. by Panosian and Gorbach. provides a comprehensive review of the general principles of the host defenses of the gastrointestinal tract and of the infectious diseases of this organ system. The reviews in this volume clearly portray the enormous challenges awaiting investigators of mucosal immunity.

Cytotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide (CY) when used as immunosuppressive agents result in a dosedependent decrease in the circulating peripheral leukocyte count. In addition. selective functional inhibition can be demonstrated following treatment with CY. In serial studies with patients receiving chronic low-dose (2 mg/kg/day) CY therapy. selective suppression of B cell function with a relative sparing of helper and suppressor T cell function for antibody production was noted. In vivo administration of CS resulted in multiple and heterogeneous effects on human mononuclear cell traffic and function with a profound and transient depletion of monocytes and lymphocytes from the circulation.

Synergy between nonspecific and specific signals in the antigen-specific responses of human B cells,1981,David Volkman and Anthony S Fauci,60,Cellular Immunology,2,415-425,Academic Press,We have previously described a system for the in vitro induction of anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) plaque-forming cells (PFC) in human peripheral blood (PB) following polyclonal triggering with pokeweed mitogen (PWM). A soluble antigen derived from hemolyzed SRBC was added to cultures of PB mononuclear cells. Addition of this antigen to PWM-stimulated cultures led to a two- to three-fold increase in the anti-SRBC PFC response seen with PWM alone. The synergistic response was specific for soluble SRBC antigen (SRBC-SA). Depletion of adherent cells eliminated the synergy between PWM and SRBC-SA. The plaques produced were macroscopic. inhibited by the addition of puromycin. and were not seen in the absence of complement. The synergistic response was dependent on the presence of human A sera absorbed with SRBC. Thus. these studies demonstrate clear-cut synergy between SRBC-SA …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:_IsBomjs8bsC,4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0008874981902835,753007844848264640,/scholar?cites=753007844848264640,,,0

25399,The cardiomyopathies and myocarditides,1980,GERALD Glick and E Braunwald,,,,1141-1147,McGraw-Hill New York,Until recent years. virtually all cases of symptomatic heart disease in adults were classified as ischemic. hypertensive. valvular. or congenital heart disease. When unequivocal evidence for one of these diagnoses was not present in an older patient. the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease was often made. even though a history of a myocardial infarction or angina pectoris could not be elicited. With the development of newer diagnostic techniques. particularly coronary arteriography. it has become clear that ischemic heart disease is not a diagnosis of exclusion. but must meet rigorous and specific criteria (Chap. 244). With this realization. various cardiomyopathies. previously considered uncommon. have emerged as important causes of morbidity and mortality. The term cardiomyopathy is used here to indicate a disease entity in which the presenting signs and symptoms result entirely or predominantly from dysfunction of the myocardium. However. myocardial lesions produced by ischemic heart disease. hypertensive cardiovascular disease. cor pulmonale. valvular heart disease. and congenital heart disease are excluded. although these disease states may produce clinical and hemodynamic findings indistinguishable from the cardiomyopathies. These may be classified on a pathologic basis as resulting either from primary involvement of the myocardium or from secondary involvement as part of a generalized disease (Table 247-1). From a clinical point of view. however. it is more desirable to classify them on the basis of differences in their pathologic physiology and differences in clinical presentation (Table 247-2).,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:tgXRM5oPLYQC,4,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12242686241570560107&hl=en&oi=scholarr,12242686241570560107,/scholar?cites=12242686241570560107,,,0

25412,NIH research: Think globally,2015,Anthony S Fauci and Francis S Collins,348,,6231,159-159,American Association for the Advancement of Science,The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has for more than 60 years supported research to improve the health and prolong the lives of people in the United States and around the world. Mean life expectancy worldwide has doubled to more than 70 years. due in large part to medical and public health interventions developed with NIH funding. Now. in the face of serious fiscal constraints. the idea has reemerged from some congressional leaders and disease constituency groups to more closely align NIH funding for disease research with disease burden in the United States. Although the nation must maintain robust research support for diseases that cause illness and death among large numbers of Americans. it would be unwise to deemphasize diseases that exact their largest toll elsewhere in the world.

In normal man. this activation is dependent on a delicate balance between helper and suppressor factors. In certain disease states. notably those which are immunologically mediated. these normal homeo—static mechanisms may be altered. Such aberrations may play a role not only in the manifestations of such disorders but in their pathogenesis as well. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sarcoidosis are disorders which although quite different in many respects. are both characterized by a variety of in vitro and in vivo immunologic abnormalities. Among these is a general hyperactivity of the humoral immune system resulting in hypergammaglobulinemia. immune complex formation and autoantibodies (Holman. 1959; James et al.. 1975). In this study. we attempted to characterize abnormalities of the immunoregulation of B cell responses of these patients. Since corticosteroids are the primary therapeutic modality in both diseases. the effects of these agents on these immuno—regulatory abnormalities were investigated.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:zxzvZ9-XIW8C,3,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=o_jHCDgyl3sC&oi=fnd&pg=PA351&dq=info:9lDgAywuMCUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=jYAky3aE_N&sig=GnGBaG11D5_YNt5hldBNyEF3jo8,2679692544863916278,/scholar?cites=2679692544863916278,,,0

The articles by Lo et al. 1 and McCrary et al. 2 provide important data and insight into the extent of the problem. The editorial by Drazen and Koski3 highlights the central issue that arises when an investigator has an equity stake in a sponsoring company while conducting a clinical trial. Martin and Kasper. 4 representing Harvard Medical School. present their position on conflicts of interest and assert “we chose to retain our current strict standards.” The assertion by Martin and Kasper seems peculiar in the light of the Harvard policy. which allows investigators to have an equity interest at “de minimis” levels. or up to $20.000 in a publicly traded company. Obviously. this de minimis level is not fixed and will fluctuate with the valuation of the company. Furthermore. Martin and Kasper state that “a randomized. double-blind. multicenter trial seems less susceptible to bias than one without those features. so that investigators involved in such trials might be permitted to have a greater financial interest in the sponsoring companies.” Having been involved with many such multicenter trials. I cannot fathom the logic of Martin and Kasper. Regardless of the rigor of any trial. the key lies in the dissemination phase and the “spin” put on the findings of the trial. For this reason. our study group has strictly prohibited any equity interest in a company whose patented therapeutic drug or device is under trial. 5-7 As pointed out by Lo et al..

However. though better than the best available antiretroviral agents at downregulating the virus. the immune system never completely suppresses it.

It is likely that the infection rate in the US is plateauing. even though the disease rate is not yet plateauing. The change in infection rate is due to the change in the behavior of the male homosexual population. Consequently. it is likely that the rate will not have the exponential increase over the next couple of years that has been experienced in the early and mid-1980s. The situation in Africa is different. Unless something dramatic is done. there may be exponential increases not only of the disease. but of infection with the virus.

25439,Immunopathogenesis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),1986,Joseph B Margolick and Anthony S Fauci,,,,949-960,Academic Press,The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the human retrovirus termed human T lymphotrophic virus (HTLV)-III or lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV). This virus selectively infects the helper–inducer subset of T lymphocytes defined by the CD4 surface antigen. In fact. the receptor for HTLV-III/LAV on the lymphocyte appears to be either the CD4 molecule itself or some other closely associated molecule. Infection of CD4+ T cells with HTLV-III/LAV in vitro results in a cytopathic effect on the target cells and a depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes which is analogous to the depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes seen in patients with AIDS. Thus. AIDS is characterized by a host of quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in the function of CD4+ cells which. in view of the wide range of immunologic functions normally induced by these cells. results in a broad array of immunologic abnormalities.

25442,Cytotoxic cellular immunity and cytomegalovirus: lessons from studies of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and immunosuppressed allograft recipients,1985,Alain H Rook and Anthony S Fauci,1,Prog. Leukocyte Biol,,159,,During the past five years. intensive studies of various populations of immunosuppressed patients with high frequencies of life-threatening infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) have broadened our understanding of the importance of cell-mediated immunity in the recovery from CMV infection. It is now clearly evident that the ability of different subsets of mononuclear cells to mediate cytotoxicity against CMV-infected cells are important determinants of the outcome of acute CMV infections. The ability to detect CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells in the peripheral blood of patients undergoing acute CMV infections bears a substantial correlation with the ultimate recovery from infection. In contrast. patients without detectable CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells during infection almost uniformly experience serious or fatal infection with CMV. Other mononuclear cells whose functions correlate with recovery from CMV infections include natural killer cells and antibody-dependent killer cells. This review will summarize the clinical studies that have been performed in our laboratory and which have formed the basis for the observations related to cell-mediated immunity to CMV.The availability of an assay for CMV-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte activity has facilitated the performance of studies analyzing the role of cell-mediated immune responses to CMV (Fig. 1). This assay utilizes sets of target cells which consist of pairs of CMV-infected and uninfected human diploid fibroblasts obtained from HLA-typed donors. The cells are radiolabelled with 51Cr for use in the cytotoxicity assays. In each assay. multiple sets of target cells are used which are matched to the effector cells …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:ehoypfNsBj8C,3,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8099979457677216344&hl=en&oi=scholarr,8099979457677216344,/scholar?cites=8099979457677216344,,,0

It is clear however that glycosylation of the HIV envelope protein. which mediates entry into target cells. plays a critical and dynamic role in transmission. Sexual transmission is inefficient. A genetically diverse HIV-1 quasi-species replicating in the donor contracts through a genetic “bottleneck” such that often only a single transmitting virus (the founder) establishes infection in the recipient. The envelope proteins of transmitted viruses frequently encode a reduced number of N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGs). How reduced glycosylation increases transmission fitness is unknown. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of reduced PNGs on the biological and structural features of HIV env that might influence transmission fitness. Transmission linked glycans exert a pronounced influence …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:0Kh4an1R61UC,2,https://journals.lww.com/jaids/Abstract/2013/04001/C105_Glycosylation_in_HIV_Transmission.32.aspx,9060067298389388242,/scholar?cites=9060067298389388242,,,0

Available at< http://hsc. house. gov/schedule. cfm,Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee. thank you for the opportunity to discuss with you today the research programs of National Institutes of Health (NIH) aimed at developing effective medical countermeasures against bioterror attacks. The terrible events of September 11. 2001. clearly exposed the vulnerability of the United States to brutal acts of terrorism. The anthrax attacks that followed just a few weeks later made it very clear that the threat of bioterrorism with pathogens or biological toxins represents a serious threat to our Nation and the world.The Administration and Congress responded forcefully to this threat. and have made biodefense a top national security priority. After a comprehensive review of the Nation’s biodefense activities. President Bush in April 2004 signed a Homeland Security Presidential Directive called “Biodefense for the 21st Century” that provides a detailed strategy for defending the Nation from biological attacks. This strategy has four pillars: Threat Awareness; Prevention and Protection; Surveillance and Detection; and Response and Recovery. The NIH was assigned the lead role in the development of medical countermeasures to biological attack. and in the conduct of research concerning potential agents of bioterrorism that directly affect human health. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is the NIH institute with primary responsibility for carrying out this assignment.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:vptNTMqK6uYC,2,https://media.nti.org/pdfs/129-NIH.pdf,16081958151283599766,/scholar?cites=16081958151283599766,,https://media.nti.org/pdfs/129-NIH.pdf,0

25501,Classics in medicine,1994,Anthony S Fauci and Sheldon M Wolff,73,Medicine,6,315-324,LWW,... Classical or generalized Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tract together with glomerulonephritis. Widespread disseminated vasculitis involving both small arteries and veins occurs to a greater or lesser degree as the disease progresses. A localized form of WG limited primarily to the upper and lower respiratory tracts has been described...WG is more common than was previously thought. Up to 1967. approximately 200 cases had been reported... The disease... is seen at any age from 3 months to as old as 75 years with a peak incidence in the fourth and fifth decades. Untreated. WG runs a rapidly fatal course with a mean survival of 5 months. 82% of patients dying within 1 year and greater than 90% dying within 2 years.

A cognate molecule produced by activated T lymphocytes was called lymphotoxin or TNF-ß [1]. Although only approximately 30% homology occurs at the amino acid level between TNF-a and TNF-ß. these molecules recognize the same surface receptors on target cells. and usually induce similar biological effects.The potential role of TNF (either-a or-ß) in the pathogenesis of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). the causative agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). was postulated on the basis of several pathological features.

The specificity of the—so called—ACPA (anti-cytoplasmic-antibody) test has recently been confirmed by others (3). In a preliminary prospective study. the ACPA test seemed to be a very good marker for disease activity. even better than ESR and C-reactive protein (2). The Dutch Study Group on Wegener's granulomatosis recently started a prospective study to define the usefulness of the ACPA test as marker of disease activity.

Harrison's Book of Internal Medicine",,1441,,DEFINITION Vasculitis is a clinicopathologic process characterized by inflammation of and damage to blood vessels. The vessel lumen is usually compromised. and this is associated with ischemia of the tissues supplied by the involved vessel. A broad and heterogeneous group of syndromes may result from this process since any type. vasculitic syndromes. It is unclear why certain individuals develop vasculitis in response to certain antigenic stimuli whereas others do not. However. it is likely that a number of factors are involved in the ultimate expression of a vasculitic syndrome. These include the genetic predisposition. the regulatory mechanisms associated with immune response to certain antigens. and the ability of the reticuloendothelial system to clear circulating complexes from the blood. The size and physicochemical properties of immune complexes. the relative degree of turbulence of blood flow. the intravascular hydrostatic pressure in different vessels. and the preexisting integrity of the vessel endothelium likely explain why only certain types of immune complexes cause vasculitis and why the vasculitic process is selective for only certain vessels in individual patients.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:zDMysJqCCKgC,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=409679681772458976&hl=en&oi=scholarr,409679681772458976,/scholar?cites=409679681772458976,,,0

25532,Mechanisms of action of glucocorticosteroids,1978,Anthony S Fauci,13,,,179-183,Academic Press,Corticosteroids can potentially interfere with virtually every phase of inflammatory and immunologic reactivity. Generally. kinetics and circulatory patterns of leukocytes are more sensitive to corticosteroid modulation than are the functional effects of cells. In addition. various classes and subclasses of leukocytes appear to differ in sensitivity to corticosteroid effects. The precise mechanisms of their effects are still unclear. However. it is likely that they relate at least in part to specific receptor interaction of corticosteroid with the involved cells. Glucocorticosteroids display a variety of complex effects on different biologic systems and cell types. This review focuses on the mechanisms of action of these agents on inflammatory and immune responses. particularly with respect to human biology in vivo and considers the effects of glucocorticosteroids on vascular tissue. leukocyte kinetics and function. and …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:Z610oKUqOA4C,2,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065774308606223,8951218520033939561,/scholar?cites=8951218520033939561,,,0

However. because it fails to eradicate recrudescing viremia. life-time administration. which is associated with toxicity. is required. Our hypothesis has been that protecting the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) in HIV-1 infected individuals could alleviate the requirement for prolonged ART. We have successfully shown that the IV infusion of a novel primatized recombinant mAb directed against integrin a4b7 just prior to and during acute SIV infection leads to a marked reduction in GIT viral loads in groups of rhesus macaques infected either intravenously or intra-rectally. More recently. using a repeated low dose intra-vaginal challenge model. we determined that administration of anti-a4b7 mAb prevented SIV transmission in 50% of challenged animals.

MD. 1930–2014,2015,David M Morens and Anthony S Fauci,211,,8,1199-1201,Oxford University Press,With the death of Albert Zaven Kapikian. aged 83 years. on 24 February 2014. the infectious diseases community lost a treasured colleague. and the world lost a major scientific contributor to the great era of viral disease discovery of the mid-20th century. In the 1950s. medical virology began to flourish. when it was learned that viruses could be propagated in tissue culture. The next 2 decades saw the discovery of most medically important human viruses known today and the development and licensure of vaccines against them. Millions of children began receiving immunizations each year. resulting in marked reductions in morbidity and mortality due to diseases such as polio and measles. At the forefront of this research was the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases (LID) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Viral disease research needed curious and creative young medical scientists willing to learn the novel techniques that enabled the discovery of infectious disease agents. Al Kapikian was just such a person when he joined the LID in 1957.At that time. the LID was full of visionary men of science. including Joseph A. Bell and Robert J. Huebner. Al’s early mentors. Robert M. Chanock. a whiz kid protégé of Albert Sabin. had just joined the LID [1]; he became Al’s lifelong friend and collaborator. The discoveries made by these men and their NIH colleagues. among them Robert Purcell. reflected the prodigious output of a close-knit. restlessly energetic research team. For nearly 6 decades.

25552,Human T Cell Clones Reactive with Soluble Antigens: Methodology. Speciﬁcity. and MHC Restriction,2012,Benjamin Sredni and David Volkman and Ronald H Schwartz and Anthony S Fauci,,"Isolation Characterization, and Utilization of T Lymphocyte Clones",,439,Elsevier,One of the major goals of immunologists for the past 5 years has been to obtain cloned populations of antigen-specific T lymphocytes. During the past year this goal has been realized by several laboratories (von Boehmer et al.. 1979; Wat-son. 1979; Glasebrook and Fitch. 1979; Schreier and Tees. 1980; Sredni et al.. 1980. 1981c; Kimoto and Fathman. 1980) including our own. However. it is important to point out that many other laboratories have contributed signiﬁcant technological advances in this area which were essential in achieving the ﬁnal outcome. In particular. the early work of MacDonald et al.(1974) on alloreac-tive T cells and Ben-Sasson et al.(1975) on antigen-specific T cells demonstrated that T lymphocytes could be propagated and enriched for specificity by repeated exposure to antigen in vitro. At about this time. innovations in soft agar technology (Rozenszajn et al.. 1975; Sredni et al.. 1975. 1976) allowed for the cloning of mitogen responsive T cells. Finally. the discovery and characterization of T cell growth factor (TCGF. also called interleukin-2)(IL-2)(Ruscetti et al.. 1977; Gillis and Smith. 1977; Farrar et al.. 1980) made it possible to maintain in vitro cultures of antigen-specific (Schn'er et al.. 1979; Watson. 1979; Augustin et al.. 1979; Apte et al.. 1981) and alloreactive (Watanabe et al.. 1977) T cells for long periods of time.

Infectious diseases strike the young disproportionately. causing approximately two-thirds of deaths among children younger than 5 years old (2).Public health professionals also know that infectious disease threats constantly ebb and flow. as new diseases emerge and old ones reemerge in terms of their impact and geographic range (Figure 1).

Retrovir. Oppor. Infect. 8th Chic Ill,,75,,The depletion of CD4+ T-lymphocytes is a central pathogenic feature of HIV-1 infection and is largely responsible for the profound immunodeficiency that is characteristic of late stages of HIV disease [1. 2]. Although the precise mechanisms of CD4+ T-cell decline remains to be elucidated. it is generally agreed that two mechanisms. cytolysis resulting from direct infection [3]. and enhanced apoptosis [4. 5] contribute to this process. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the viral envelope protein gp120/41 enhances the rate of apoptosis in activated T-cells in vitro [reviewed in 6. 7]. Envelopemediated apoptosis of T-cells is a consequence of envelope-mediated signal transduction and several laboratories have demonstrated that envelope proteins transduce signals through the CD4 receptor as well as through the fusion coreceptors. CCR5 and CXCR4 [8].It is unclear which signals. those delivered through CD4. CCR5 and/or CXCR4. contribute to envelope-mediated apoptosis. Prior to the identification of CCR5 and CXCR4 as HIV-1 coreceptors. Finkel and colleagues as well as Berndt and colleagues demonstrated that cross-linking the CD4 receptor with monoclonal antibodies increased rates of apoptosis in activated CD4+ T-cells [9. 10]. These observations suggest that CD4 engagement by gp120 alone could account for envelope-mediated apoptosis. However. a number of studies have implicated envelope-CXCR4 interactions in envelope-mediated apoptosis [10-15]. Interestingly. Grivel and colleagues. utilizing explanted lymphoid tissue. have demonstrated that R5 and X4 viruses are similarly cytopathic. but that X4 viruses deplete CD4+ T …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:djft3U1LymYC,1,http://www.academia.edu/download/43458935/The_Role_of_the_CD4_Receptor_versus_HIV_20160307-27474-3ls4u4.pdf,4109767142537658452,/scholar?cites=4109767142537658452,,http://www.academia.edu/download/43458935/The_Role_of_the_CD4_Receptor_versus_HIV_20160307-27474-3ls4u4.pdf,0

New York: Dekker,,75-88,,Several questions remain unanswered concerning the immunopathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection leading to the clinical disease termed the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)(1). The causative agents of this disease. HIV type 1 or type 2. utilize as their cell surface receptor the CD4 molecule. which normally plays an important role in immune recognition and cell signaling (reviewed in Ref. 2). The identification of CD4 as the viral receptor has explained the selective tropism of this virus for a discrete functional subset of T lymphocytes with helper/inducer function and for mononuclear phagocytes (MPs)(1). One peculiar aspect of HIV infection is the long period of clinical latency (approximately 10 years) following primary infection. which is characterized by high levels of virus replication in the peripheral blood (PB) compartment occurring within weeks of inital infection and lasting 1 to 3 weeks with or without the presence of acute symptoms (1. 3).

In fact. the development of an antibody response to the various components of HIV within 2-3 weeks from the onset of primary HIV infection represents the most reliable diagnostic tool to determine if a person has been infected with the virus. In addition to the HIV-specific humoral response. an HIV-specific cell-mediated immune response has been described in a significant proportion of HIV-infected individuals as indicated by HIV-specific T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity [1]. Furthermore. on the basis of the findings in other viral infections. one may speculate that the immune system of the host has several other means to mediate antiviral activity.

NY,The study of human B cell function involves examination of the events leading to maturation of B cells from B lineage lymphoid progenitor cells as well as the stages of activation. proliferation and differentiation which mature resting B lymphocytes must undergo to become immunoglobulin producing plasma cells [1–3]. In human B cell physiology (as opposed to murine B cell physiology) there appear to be molecules which act only at specific stages to induce either activation. proliferation or differentiation. However. as in murine B cell physiology. there are also molecules which can act at various stages. Antigen or anti-Ig will activate cells while B cell growth factors (BCGFs) [4–8] will induce their proliferation and B cell differentiation factors including interleukin-6 (IL-6) [9–11] will induce their differentiation. IL-2 in high concentrations can induce activation [12]. proliferation. and differentiation [13] of human …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:37Fl7vPTsUIC,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-8862-3_2,4400626891351114573,/scholar?cites=4400626891351114573,,,0

The cytopathic nature of this virus for this T cell subset (helper/inducer) is thought to be responsible for the host-defense defect leading to the profound susceptibility of these patients to opportunistic infections. The CD4 molecule. which bears epitopes associated with the binding of monoclonal antibodies (OKT4 and Leu 3). has been suggested as the receptor for HIV [4. 5]. Previous studies showing blocking of infection with HIV by these monoclonal antibodies. as well as inhibition of binding of virus to target cells. have indicated that the CD4 molecule is a major target structure on the surface of susceptible cells. In a recent study [6] using lymphocytes from individuals lacking the OKT4 epitope. it was found that their cells …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:jq04SsiGh3QC,1,https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/155/3/592/851854,17817658052052775594,/scholar?cites=17817658052052775594,,,0

TGF-beta was shown to inhibit IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation. The addition of picograms amounts of TGF-beta to cultures of IL-2-stimulated human T lymphocytes suppressed DNA synthesis by 60-80%. A potential mechanism of this inhibition was found. TGF-beta inhibited IL-2-induced upregulation of the IL-2 and transferrin receptors. Specific high-affinity receptors for TGF-beta were found both on resting and activated T cells. Cellular activation was shown to result in a five-to sixfold increase in the number of TGF-beta receptors on a per cell basis. without a …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:WM2K3OHRCGMC,1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2188095/,260304537298831387,/scholar?cites=260304537298831387,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2188095/pdf/je16351037.pdf,0

Among the defects described is the impairment of normal B cell function. that includes a significant delay in the development of the anti-HIV humoral immune response. The mechanisms underlying this delay are not fully understood. In the present study. we asked whether gp120-induced signaling through α 4 β 7 on B cells could disrupt their function. We show that gp120 binds and signals through α 4 β 7 on naïve B cells. resulting in an abortive proliferative response.Methods: We performed microarray analysis. RT-PCR. CFSE proliferation assay.

CD4+ T cells expressing α4β7 represent an ideal target for productive infection during mucosal transmission. However. many details surrounding the interaction between HIV and α4β7 remain unresolved. We hypothesize that the evolution of a specific interaction between HIV and α4β7 provides the virus a means to increase the efficiency of infection in mucosal tissues. Disrupting this interaction may provide a strategy to reduce or prevent mucosal transmission. Here we identify key features of the α4β7-HIV gp120 interaction that facilitate viral replication.Methods: We evaluated the capacity of gp120. by binding to α4β7. to induce cellular proliferation of primary CD4+ T cells using CFSE proliferation assays.

The authors stressed that CHCC is a nomenclature; therefore. it is not a classification system that specifies what findings must be observed in a specific patient. nor is it a diagnostic system directing clinical management. They explained their terminology by way of examples: diagnosis is the name of a disease. for example polyarteritis nodosa. Definition is based on the disease processes in a patient that justifies use of the diagnosis. Classification criteria are observations that classify a specific patient into a standardized category for study. Diagnostic criteria are observations that demonstrate or predict the presence of the defining features of the disease in a specific patient. A major feature of CHCC 2012 is the phasing out of eponyms when there was sufficient understanding of the pathophysiology to propose an alternative name. Major shifts away from eponyms are granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s granulomatosis)(GPA); IgA vasculitis (Henoch–Schönlein)(IgAV); eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg–Strauss)(EGPA).

AND DIFFERENTIATION,2013,Harris Goldstein Nakagawa and Normal L Witzel and Howard S Mostowski and Anthony S Fauci,213,Mechanisms of Lymphocyte Activation and Immune Regulation,,163,Springer Science & Business Media,Efforts to evaluate normal human B cell physiology have resulted in the development of a model in which a resting B cell must progress through stages of activation. proliferation. and differentiation before becoming an immunoglobulin (Ig)-producing cell (1–4). Presumably each of these stages has specific signals. positive as well as negative. which control the nature as well as the intensity of the response.

These interventions have clearly been shown to be efficacious in clinical trials and effective when properly implemented “on the ground.” For example. combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically improves the health and longevity of HIV-infected people. Adult male circumcision is highly effective in protecting heterosexual men from acquiring HIV infection. The prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV infection by the use of antiretroviral treatment has been highly successful. Antiretrovirals also have a critical role in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV. making treated HIV-infected people dramatically less likely to heterosexually transmit the virus to others. and also as pre-exposure prophylaxis …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:Oo_WeVVXg5wC,0,https://journals.lww.com/jaids/Abstract/2013/04001/E109_Ending_the_HIV_AIDS_Pandemic___Research_and.53.aspx,,,,,0

This information is used at both the global and national level for planning and allocating performance-based funds. However. the validity of household-derived coverage sources has not yet been widely assessed or discussed. To advance knowledge on the validity of different sources of immunization coverage. we undertook a global review of literature. We assessed concordance. sensitivity. specificity. positive and negative predictive value. and coverage percentage point difference when subtracting household vaccination source from a medical provider source. Median coverage difference per paper ranged from− 61 to+ 1 percentage points between card versus provider sources and− 58 to+ 45 percentage points between recall versus provider source.

Ottesen,2012,Anthony S Fauci,9,Human T Cell Clones: A New Approach to Immune Regulation,,125,Springer Science & Business Media,The development of antigen-specific T lymphocyte lines and clones has greatly facilitated the investigation of the mechanisms by which T cells recognize foreign antigens and subsequently elaborate immuoregulatory lymphokines. Human antigen-specific helper T cell lines and clones have now been developed by the method of cyclic restimulation with antigen” which are completely independent of exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2) for their growth. Following a narrowly restricted stimulation signal with the appropriate antigen in the context of histocompatible antigen-presenting cells (APC). these T cells can produce several polyclonal B cell factors which act on discrete subsets of B cells depending on their state of activation or receptiveness to these lymphokines.In the present study. T cells specific for two kinds of antigen were utilized. T cells specific for the antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) were developed from donors immunized with this protein. Similarly.

25753,THE HUMAN B CELL CYCLE: ACTIVATION. PROLIFERATION. AND,2012,Julian L Ambrus Jr and Anthony S Fauci,8,Immune Regulation,,101,Springer Science & Business Media,The full expression of a competent immune response. either cell mediated or humoral. requires the precise cooperation of a number of cell types which communicate either by cell-to-cell contact or by soluble immunoregulatory factors. With regard to the humoral immune response. B lymphocytes play the central role as they progress through the cell cycle from the resting to the fully differentiated State whereby they evolve into immunoglobulin (Ig)-secreting cells. Dutton et al. 1 first suggested that soluble helper factors. presumably produced by T lymphocytes. could activate B cells to become Ig-secreting cells. Several laboratories have subsequently been involved in delineating the events which occur between activation of B cells and their production of Ig. Kishimoto et al.” demonstrated in the rabbit model that the crosslinkage of surface Ig by anti-Ig combined with T cell-derived helper factors could induce B cells to produce Ig. This was confirmed in the murine system by Parker et al. 3 and led to the development of a similar model in the human system by Yoshizaki et al. 4 and by our own laboratory” to further study B cell function. This model basically maintains that resting B cells can be activated by antigen or other surface Ig crosslinking agents to express receptors for growth factors. In the presence of growth factors.

With regard to specific corticosteroid effects on peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells. it is now known that in vivo administration of CS selectively and transiently redistributes T cells as opposed to non-T cells from the circulation to other compartments. primarily the spleen and bone marrow (Fauci and Dale. 1974; Fauci. 1975). In addition. recent studies in man have reported that the function of various types of suppressive immunoregulatory cells are sensitive to the presence of CS (Sampson et al.. 1975; Waldmann et al.. 1976). ie. the particular function is abrogated by CS in in vitro assays. Therefore. using a protocol for single dose hydrocortisone (OHC) administration in normal subjects (Fauci and Dale. 1974) we investigated the effect of in vivo CS on the kinetics of T cell subpopulations as defined by Moretta et al.(1977)(TG.

Inc.,Background: Many HIV databases and applications focus on a limited domain of HIV knowledge. Since even a ‘‘simple’’organism like HIV represents a very complex system with many interacting elements. the fractured structure of existing databases and applications likely limits our ability to investigate and understand HIV. To facilitate research. therefore. we have built HIVToolbox. which integrates much of the knowledge about HIV proteins and presents the data in an interactive web application. HIVToolbox allows quick and convenient hypotheses generation. experiment interpretation. and potential new drug structure creation. Methods: HIVToolbox was built as a standard three-tier J2EE web application. consisting of 1) an underlying relational MySQL database. 2) a set of standard Java data access objects that pull data from the database. and 3) a set of dynamic web pages the user interacts with. HIV-1 data from external sources such as the Protein Data Bank. NCBI. Los Alamos. etc. was collected. curated. and stored in the HIVToolbox database. Additional data. such as homology and position statistics matrices. was generated from existing data. Since version 1. drug binding site and drug resistant mutation data has also been added. Results: HIVToolbox was used to create several new hypotheses about HIV-1 integrase. including predicting the location of a CK2 phosphorylation site. which was later confirmed by experiment.,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:53CL4OiWbn0C,0,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/138319,,,,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/138319,0

25769,Evolving Ethical Issues Over the Course of the AIDS Pandemic.,2012,Anthony S Fauci,34,Public Health Reviews (2107-6952),1,,,In the early years of the AIDS pandemic. one of the major ethical considerations facing frontline AIDS medical researchers was the issue of patient accessibility to clinical trials. This issue loomed large because at the time. there were no licensed antiretroviral drugs to treat people with the disease. there were only experimental drugs being tested in clinical trials. 1 Clearly. the standard approach to the design of clinical trials--that is. rigid eligibility criteria as well as the strict regulatory aspects that attend clinical trial investigations and drug approval--was not well-suited to a novel. largely fatal disease such as this with no effective treatments. and we had many intense discussions about how to make that approach more flexible and ethically sound. One example. which I and others worked closely with the AIDS activists to develop. was called a parallel track for clinical trials.

First. the authors did not report how antiretroviral drugs were stopped in the patient in this study. This information is critical to interpret the first plasma viral rebound. This is especially true when the antiretroviral regimen includes a nonnucleoside analogue (efavirenz) with a much longer half-life than the nucleoside backbone [2]. potentially giving resistant viral quasispecies in the reservoirs a replication advantage in the setting of monotherapy with a drug that has low genetic resistance barrier for a significant amount of time. Population or clonal sequencing of the reverse transcriptase gene during viral rebound episodes would have been informative. The ethnicity of the patient is also relevant as this may further extends the half-life of efavirenz.Second. the authors postulated but did not illustrate that the second viral rebound was due to the …,True,0dDO3SAAAAAJ:MqTxh1vmwXEC,0,https://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/FullText/2011/03270/Authors__reply_to_correspondence_by_Le_and_Farrar.23.aspx,,,,,0

Low-level viral replication occurs initially in mucosal [CD4. sup.+] T cells. but within days high-level replication occurs in Peyer's patches. the gut lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes. Understanding the early events in HIV transmission may provide valuable information relevant to the development of an HIV vaccine. The viral quasispecies in a donor contracts through a genetic bottleneck in the recipient. such that. in low-risk settings. infection is frequently established by a single founder virus.

25782,Medicine and Public Issues,2011,Carl W Dieffenbach and Anthony S Fauci,154,Ann Intern Med,,766-771,,In the United States. the development and implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy is designed partially to address the structural barriers to optimal care for HIV-infected persons (15). In this context. a portion of the US agenda for implementing AIDS research focuses on defining optimal. cost-effective ways to increase the uptake of HIV testing; maximize the take-up of services; and foster high levels of adherence to treatment regimens. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy also seeks to fully implement the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on HIV testing (16) and to establish incentives for organizations that conduct testing to provide efficient and effective linkage to care. A major success in the third decade of the epidemic has been expansion of HIV care and treatment in the developing world. The US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). initiated in 2003 by former President George W. Bush; the multilateral Global Fund to Fight AIDS. Tuberculosis and Malaria; and such nongovernmental organizations as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. the Clinton Foundation. and Médecins Sans Frontieres. among others. have transformed the fate of countless HIV-infected persons in the developing world. particularly southern Africa. by providing treatment and care for those who are infected and prevention services for those at risk for infection (8. 17).

25792,Molecular evolution and phylogenetics,2000,Masatoshi Nei and Sudhir Kumar,,,,,Oxford University Press,During the last ten years. remarkable progress has occurred in the study of molecular evolution. Among the most important factors that are responsible for this progress are the development of new statistical methods and advances in computational technology. In particular. phylogenetic analysis of DNA or protein sequences has become a powerful tool for studying molecular evolution. Along with this developing technology. the application of the new statistical and computational methods has become more complicated and there is no comprehensive volume that treats these methods in depth.

However. for such large data sets even a moderate exploration of the tree space needed to identify the optimal tree is virtually impossible. For these cases the neighbor-joining (NJ) method is frequently used because of its demonstrated accuracy for smaller data sets and its computational speed. As data sets grow. however. the fraction of the tree space examined by the NJ algorithm becomes minuscule. Here. we report the results of our computer simulation for examining the accuracy of NJ trees for inferring very large phylogenies.

Currently. mutation rate is thought to vary many fold among genes within a genome and among lineages in mammals. We have conducted a computational analysis of 5.669 genes (17.208 sequences) from species representing major groups of placental mammals to characterize the extent of mutation rate differences among genes in a genome and among diverse mammalian lineages. We find that mutation rate is approximately constant per year and largely similar among genes.

Evidence is provided by the near-absence of fossils representing modern orders before the K/T boundary 4. 5.

However. details of the timing and number of symbiotic events are unclear. A timescale for the early evolution of eukaryotes would help to better understand the relationship between these biological events and changes in Earth's environment. such as the rise in oxygen. We used refined methods of sequence alignment. site selection. and time estimation to address these questions with protein sequences from complete genomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Eukaryotes were found to evolve faster than prokaryotes. with those eukaryotes derived from eubacteria evolving faster than those derived from archaebacteria. We found an early time of divergence (~4 billion years ago. Ga) for archaebacteria and the archaebacterial genes in eukaryotes. Our analyses support at least two horizontal gene transfer events in the origin of eukaryotes. at 2.7 Ga and 1.8 Ga. Time estimates for the origin of cyanobacteria (2.6 Ga) and the divergence of an early-branching eukaryote that lacks mitochondria (Giardia) (2.2 Ga) fall between those two events. We find support for two symbiotic events in the origin of eukaryotes: one premitochondrial and a later mitochondrial event.

For m taxa. at most (m-1)!/2 trees are examined and the tree with the minimum sum of branch lengths (S) is chosen as the final tree. This algorithm provides simple strategies for restricting the tree space searched and allows us to implement efficient ways of dynamically computing the ordinary least squares estimates of S for the topologies examined.

Currently. investigators must visually inspect numerous images containing embryonic expression patterns to identify spatially similar patterns for inferring potential genetic interactions. The lack of a computational approach to identify pattern similarities is an impediment to advancement in developmental biology research because of the rapidly increasing amount of available embryonic gene expression data. Therefore. we have developed computational approaches to automate the comparison of gene expression patterns contained in images of early stage Drosophila melanogaster embryos (prior to the beginning of germ-band elongation); similarities and differences in gene expression patterns in these early stages have extensive developmental effects.

Here. we present evidence of convergent evolution at the molecular sequence level in the putative peptide-binding regions (PBRs) of human and mouse class Ib genes. So far. there are few if any convincing examples of convergent evolution at the amino acid sequence level. and such evolution is believed to be …,True,G5zYeD8AAAAJ:3LFXdIMtrAwC,61,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-abstract/14/10/1035/1290770,7825526516701146012,/scholar?cites=7825526516701146012,,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/14/10/1035/11165769/5yeag.pdf,0

In order to generate initial clues to regulatory interactions. biologists frequently need to know the set of genes expressed at the same time at specific locations in a developing embryo. as well as related research publications.

Computational methods are frequently applied to predict impairment of gene function by nonsynonymous mutations in individual genomes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (nSNPs) in populations. These computational tools are. however. known to fail 15%–40% of the time. We find that accurate discrimination between benign and deleterious mutations is strongly influenced by the long-term (among species) history of positions that harbor those mutations.

The underlying assumption is that co-expressed genes are more likely to contain shared TFBS and. thus. TFBS can be identified computationally. Indeed. gene pairs with a very high expression correlation show a significant excess of shared binding sites in yeast. We have tested this assumption in a more complex organism. Drosophila melanogaster. by using experimentally determined TFBS and microarray expression data. We have also examined the reverse relationship between the expression correlation and the extent of TFBS sharing. Results: Pairs of genes with shared TFBS show. on average. a higher degree of co-expression than those with no common TFBS in Drosophila.

Assuming that nullomers are the signatures of natural selection against deleterious sequences in humans. the use of nullomers in drug target identification. pesticide development. environmental monitoring. and forensic applications has been envisioned.ResultsHere. we show that the hypermutability of CpG dinucleotides. rather than the natural selection against the nullomer sequences. is likely the reason for the phenomenal event of short sequence motifs becoming nullomers. Furthermore. many reported human nullomers differ by only one nucleotide. which reinforces the role of mutation in the evolution of the constellation of nullomers in populations and species. The known nullomers in chimpanzee. cow. dog. and mouse genomes show patterns that are consistent with those seen in humans.ConclusionsThe role of mutations. instead of selection. in generating nullomers cast doubt on the utility of nullomers in many envisioned applications. because of their dependence on the role of lethal selection on the origin of nullomers.,True,G5zYeD8AAAAJ:pNtIkOHbxKsC,48,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001022,12805116548024834060,/scholar?cites=12805116548024834060,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001022,0

Investigators manually inspect hundreds or thousands of expression patterns to identify those that are spatially similar and to ultimately infer potential gene interactions. However. the rapid accumulation of gene expression pattern data over the last two decades. facilitated by high-throughput techniques. has produced a need for the development of efficient approaches for direct comparison of images. rather than their textual descriptions. to identify spatially similar expression patterns. The effectiveness of the Binary Feature Vector (BFV) and Invariant Moment Vector (IMV) based digital representations of the gene expression patterns in finding biologically meaningful patterns was compared for a small (226 images) and a large (1819 images) dataset. For each dataset. an ordered list of images. with respect to a query image. was generated to identify overlapping and similar gene expression patterns. in a manner comparable to what a developmental biologist might do. The results showed that the BFV representation consistently outperforms the IMV representation in finding biologically meaningful matches when spatial overlap of the gene expression pattern and the genes involved are considered. Furthermore. we explored the value of conducting image-content based searches in a dataset where individual expression components (or domains) of multi-domain expression patterns were also included separately.

Thus. study of the N content of biomolecules may establish important connections between ecology and genomics. However. while significant differences in the elemental composition of whole organisms are well documented. how the flux of nutrients in the cell has shaped the evolution of different cellular processes remains poorly understood. By examining the elemental composition of major functional classes of proteins in four multicellular eukaryotic model organisms. we find that the catabolic machinery shows substantially lower N content than the anabolic machinery and the rest of the proteome. This pattern suggests that ecological selection for N conservation specifically targets cellular components that are highly expressed in response to nutrient limitation.

This assumption is fundamental to estimating the fraction of harmful protein mutations and to identifying adaptive evolution at individual codons and proteins. We show that the assumption is not justifiable because a much larger fraction of codon positions is involved in hypermutable CpG dinucleotides as compared with the introns. leading to a higher expected replacement mutation rate per site in a vast majority of the genes. Consideration of this difference reveals a higher intensity of purifying natural selection than previously inferred in human genes.

Since different domains vary in their roles regarding overall gene function. the ability for a mutation in a gene region to produce disease varies among domains. We tested two hypotheses regarding distributions of mutations among functional domains by using (1) sets of single nucleotide disease mutations for six genes (CFTR. TSC2. G6PD. PAX6. RS1. and PAH) and (2) sets of polymorphic replacement and silent mutations found in two genes (CFTR and TSC2). First. we tested the null hypothesis that sets of mutations are uniformly distributed among functional domains within genes.

In a genome-wide analysis. we discovered that the estimates of population differentiation (e.g..

Despite their functional importance and reported involvement in many diseases. evolutionary analyses have produced enigmatic results because only weak or no selective pressures have been attributed to many types of PTMs. In a large-scale analysis of 16.836 PTM positions from 4.484 human proteins. we find that positions harboring PTMs show evidence of higher purifying selection in 70% of the phosphorylated and N-linked glycosylated proteins. The purifying selection is up to 42% more severe at PTM residues as compared with the corresponding unmodified amino acids.

The relative linear locations of these genes on human sequence maps were used as ""rulers"" to annotate bovine and porcine genomes based on a CSAM (contiguous sets of autosomal markers) approach. A CSAM is an uninterrupted set of markers in one genome (primary genome; the human genome in this study) that is syntenic in the other genome (secondary genome; the bovine and porcine genomes in this study). The analysis revealed 81 conserved syntenies and 161 CSAMs between human and bovine autosomes and 50 conserved syntenies and 95 CSAMs between human and porcine autosomes.

However. emerging evidence from the sequencing of multiple tumors and tumor regions per individual suggests that late-arising subclones with additional driver mutations are underestimated in single-sample analyses. To test whether driver mutations generally map to early tumor development. we examined multi-regional tumor sequencing data from 101 individuals reported in 11 published studies. Following previous studies. we annotated mutations as early-arising when all tumors/regions had those mutations (ubiquitous). We then inferred the fraction of mutations occurring early and compared it with late-arising mutations that were found in only single tumors/regions. While a large fraction of driver mutations in tumors occurred relatively early in cancers. later driver mutations occurred at least as frequently as the early drivers in a substantial number of patients. This result was robust to many different approaches to annotate driver mutations. The relative frequency of early and late driver mutations varied among patients of the same cancer type and in different cancer types. We found that previous reports of the preponderance of early driver mutations were primarily informed by analysis of single tumor variant allele profiles. with which it is challenging to clearly distinguish between early and late drivers.

This assumption has been questioned on the basis of increasingly large data sets. which have shown significant variability of rates in evolutionary lineages. To address this issue. tests have been developed to examine whether rates of molecular evolution vary significantly among taxonomic groups or phylogenetic lineages. Two major types of tests exist: those based on comparisons of genetic distances and those based on likelihood ratios.

Genomic advances are revealing that some non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) may cause differences in drug efficacy and side effects. Therefore. it is desirable to evaluate nsSNVs of interest in their ability to modulate the drug response. We found that the available data on the link between drug response and nsSNV is rather modest. There were only 31 distinct drug response-altering (DR-altering) and 43 distinct drug response-neutral (DR-neutral) nsSNVs in the whole Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB). However. even with this modest dataset. it was clear that existing bioinformatics tools have difficulties in correctly predicting the known DR-altering and DR-neutral nsSNVs. They exhibited an overall accuracy of less than 50%. which was not better than random diagnosis. We found that the underlying problem is the markedly different evolutionary properties between positions harboring nsSNVs linked to drug responses and those observed for inherited diseases. To solve this problem. we developed a new diagnosis method. Drug-EvoD. which was trained on the evolutionary properties of nsSNVs associated with drug responses in a sparse learning framework. Drug-EvoD achieves a TPR of 84% and a TNR of 53%. with a balanced accuracy of 69%. which improves upon other methods significantly. The new tool will enable researchers to computationally identify nsSNVs that may affect drug responses.

For this purpose. the image is first subjected to a registration process that involves edge fitting and size-standardization. It is followed by segmentation in order to delineate the expression pattern from the cellular background. The moment invariants for the segmented pattern are computed. Image dissimilarity between images is computed based on these moment invariants for each image pair.

Both discrete and continuous traits can be analyzed in GWAS to discover associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits of interest. Associations are typically determined by estimating the significance of the statistical relationship between genetic loci and the given trait. However. the prioritization of bona fide. reproducible genetic associations from GWAS results remains a central challenge in identifying genomic loci underlying common complex diseases. Evolutionary-aware meta-analysis of the growing GWAS literature is one way to address this challenge and to advance from association to causation in the discovery of genotype-phenotype relationships. We have created an evolutionary GWAS resource to enable in-depth query and exploration of published GWAS results. This resource uses the publically available GWAS results annotated in the GRASP2 database. The GRASP2 database includes results from 2082 studies. 177 broad phenotype categories. and ~8.87 million SNP-phenotype associations. For each SNP in e-GRASP. we present information from the GRASP2 database for convenience as well as evolutionary information (e.g.. rate and timespan). Users can. therefore. identify not only SNPs with highly significant phenotype-association P-values. but also SNPs that are highly replicated and/or occur at evolutionarily conserved sites that are likely to be functionally important.

Exponential growth in computation time appears to be inevitable when an optimal alignment is required for many sequences. Exact costs of optimum alignments are therefore rarely computed. Consequently much effort has been invested in algorithms for alignment that are heuristic. or explore a restricted class of solutions. These give an upper bound on the alignment cost. but it is equally important to determine the quality of the solution obtained. In the absence of an optimal alignment with which to compare. lower bounds may be calculated to assess the quality of the alignment. As more effort is invested in improving upper bounds (alignment algorithms). it is therefore important to improve lower bounds as well.

They reveal the temporal history of a pathogen spread through the populations as captured in the evolutionary history of strains. These timetrees are inferred by using molecular sequences of pathogenic strains sampled at different times. That is. temporally sampled sequences enable the inference of sequence divergence times. Here. we present a new approach (RelTime with Dated Tips [RTDT]) to estimating pathogen timetrees based on a relative rate framework underlying the RelTime approach that is algebraic in nature and distinct from all other current methods. RTDT does not require many of the priors demanded by Bayesian approaches. and it has light computing requirements. In analyses of an extensive collection of computer-simulated datasets. we found the accuracy of RTDT time estimates and the coverage probabilities of their confidence intervals (CIs) to be excellent. In analyses of empirical datasets. RTDT produced dates that were similar to those reported in the literature. In comparative benchmarking with Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods (LSD.

Numerous studies of model species describe compensatory roles of mutations in mediating competitive fitness. and there is growing evidence that these mutation types also drive adaptation of S. aureus strains. However. few studies have tracked amino acid changes during the complete evolutionary trajectory of antibiotic adaptation or been able to predict their functional relevance. Here. we have assessed the efficacy of computational methods to predict biological resistance of a collection of clinically known Resistance Associated Mutations (RAMs). We have found that >90% of known RAMs are incorrectly predicted to be functionally neutral by at least one of the prediction methods used. By tracing the evolutionary histories of all of the false negative RAMs. we have discovered that a significant number are reversion mutations to ancestral alleles also carried in the MSSA476 methicillin-sensitive isolate. These genetic reversions are most prevalent in strains following daptomycin treatment and show a tendency to accumulate in biological pathway reactions that are distinct from those accumulating non-reversion mutations. Our studies therefore show that in addition to non-reversion mutations. reversion mutations arise in isolates exposed to new antibiotic treatments. It is possible that acquisition of reversion mutations in the genome may prevent substantial fitness costs during the progression of resistance.

Several theories about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been proposed. Although Betacoronavirus found in Rhinolophus bats from China have been broadly implicated. their genetic dissimilarity to SARS-CoV-2 is so high that they are highly unlikely to be its direct ancestors. Thus. an intermediary host is suspected to link bat to human coronaviruses.

25959,Delineation of Tumor Migration Paths by Using a Bayesian Biogeographic Approach,2019,Antonia Chroni and Tracy Vu and Sayaka Miura and Sudhir Kumar,11,Cancers,12,1880,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Understanding tumor progression and metastatic potential are important in cancer biology. Metastasis is the migration and colonization of clones in secondary tissues. Here. we posit that clone migration events between tumors resemble the dispersal of individuals between distinct geographic regions. This similarity makes Bayesian biogeographic analysis suitable for inferring cancer cell migration paths. We evaluated the accuracy of a Bayesian biogeography method (BBM) in inferring metastatic patterns and compared it with the accuracy of a parsimony-based approach (metastatic and clonal history integrative analysis. MACHINA) that has been specifically developed to infer clone migration patterns among tumors. We used computer-simulated datasets in which simple to complex migration patterns were modeled. BBM and MACHINA were effective in reliably reconstructing simple migration patterns from primary tumors to metastases. However. both of them exhibited a limited ability to accurately infer complex migration paths that involve the migration of clones from one metastatic tumor to another and from metastasis to the primary tumor. Therefore. advanced computational methods are still needed for the biologically realistic tracing of migration paths and to assess the relative preponderance of different types of seeding and reseeding events during cancer progression in patients.

25960,On estimating evolutionary probabilities of population variants,2019,Ravi Patel and Sudhir Kumar,19,BMC Evolutionary Biology,1,133,BioMed Central,The evolutionary probability (EP) of an allele in a DNA or protein sequence predicts evolutionarily permissible (ePerm; EP ≥ 0.05) and forbidden (eForb; EP < 0.05) variants. EP of an allele represents an independent evolutionary expectation of observing an allele in a population based solely on the long-term substitution patterns captured in a multiple sequence alignment. In the neutral theory. EP and population frequencies can be compared to identify neutral and non-neutral alleles. This approach has been used to discover candidate adaptive polymorphisms in humans. which are eForbs segregating with high frequencies.

This conclusion was based on the experimental finding that the G allele exhibits stronger p53-RE activity than the A allele and that the observation that the G allele is found to be in much higher frequency in Europeans than Africans. This SNP is in high linkage disequilibrium with variants that are strongly associated with cancer risk in genome-wide association studies.

Fine mapping of regulatory variants at these loci is a daunting task due to the juxtaposition of causal and linked variants at a locus as well as the likelihood of interactions among multiple variants. This problem is exacerbated in genes with multiple cis-acting eQTL. where superimposed effects of adjacent loci further distort the association signals. Results: We developed a novel algorithm. TreeMap. that identifies putative causal variants in cis-eQTL accounting for multisite effects and genetic linkage at a locus. Guided by the hierarchical structure of linkage disequilibrium. TreeMap performs an organized search for individual and multiple causal variants. Via extensive simulations. we show that TreeMap detects co-regulating variants more accurately than current methods. Furthermore. its high computational efficiency enables genome-wide analysis of long-range eQTL. We applied TreeMap to GTEx data of brain hippocampus samples and transverse colon samples to search for eQTL in gene bodies and in 4 Mbps gene-flanking regions. discovering numerous distal eQTL. Furthermore. we found concordant distal eQTL that were present in both brain and colon samples. implying long-range regulation of gene expression.

For example. in the study of gene interaction and regulation in Drosophila embryogenesis. the analysis is most biologically meaningful when in situ hybridization (ISH) gene expression pattern images from the same developmental stage are compared. However. labeling training data with precise stages is very time-consuming even for evelopmental biologists. Thus. a critical challenge is how to build accurate computational models for precise developmental stage classification from limited training samples. In addition. identification and visualization of developmental landmarks are required to enable biologists to interpret prediction results and calibrate models. To address these challenges. we propose a deep two-step low-shot learning framework to accurately classify ISH images using limited training images. Specifically. to enable accurate model training on limited training samples. we formulate the task as a deep low-shot learning problem and develop a novel two-step learning approach. including data-level learning and feature-level learning. We use a deep residual network as our base model and achieve improved performance in the precise stage prediction task of ISH images. Furthermore. the deep model can be interpreted by computing saliency maps. which consist of pixel-wise contributions of an image to its prediction result.

25982,Molecular and morphological clocks for estimating evolutionary divergence times,2020,Jose Barba-Montoya and Qiqing Tao and Sudhir Kumar and Sudhir Kumar,,in review,,,,Background: Matrices of morphological characters are frequently used for dating species divergence 20 times in systematics. In some studies. morphological and molecular character data from living taxa 21 are combined. whereas others use morphological characters from extinct taxa as well. We investigated 22 whether morphological data produce time estimates that are concordant with molecular data. If true. it 23 will justify the use of morphological characters alongside molecular data in divergence time 24 inference. 25Results: We systematically analyzed three empirical datasets from different species groups to test the 26 concordance of dates of species divergence inferred using molecular and discrete morphological data 27 from extant taxa as test cases. We found a high correlation between their divergence time estimates. 28 despite a poor linear relationship between branch lengths for morphological and molecular data 29 mapped onto the same phylogeny. This was because node-to-tip distances showed a much higher 30 correlation than branch lengths. because of an averaging effect over multiple branches. We found that 31 nodes with a large number of taxa often benefit from such averaging. but some considerable 32 discordance between time estimates from molecules and morphology may still occur because some 33 deeper branches show large difference from two types of data. 34 Conclusions: Our findings suggest that node-and tip-calibration approaches may be better suited for 35 nodes with a large number of taxa. Nevertheless. we highlight the importance of evaluating the 36 concordance of time structure in morphological …,True,G5zYeD8AAAAJ:VBqjOGLmcYMC,0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-29165/latest.pdf,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-29165/latest.pdf,0

Pocket-sized versions and personal digital assistant (PDA) downloadable versions are useful at the point of care. Some surveys have shown that the intended end-users are sometimes unaware of the existence of guidelines. or simply do not translate them into practice. so this is why implementation programmes for new guidelines form an important component of the dissemination of knowledge.

The product of the 2 stages yields the mechanical external efficiency and is most commonly used in clinical studies as it represents the conversion of MVo2 to “useful” EW. For the sake of clarity and brevity. only (noninvasive) assessment of mechanical external efficiency will be discussed in this review. To express efficiency in a dimensionless value or percentage.

Myo-cardial blood flow (assessed with positron emission tomography). myocardial function (by echocardiography). and hemodynamic data were collected before and during low (measured mean plasma concentration. 0.5 ng/ml) and high (5 ng/ml) plasma concentrations of dexmedetomidine.Results: The low concentration of dexmedetomidine reduced myocardial perfusion (mean difference. 27% from baseline [95% confidence interval. 31 to 23%]. P< 0.001) in parallel with a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand (estimated by the rate–pressure product (23%[28 to 18%]. P< 0.001). The high dexmedetomidine plasma concentration did not further attenuate myocardial perfusion (3%[12 to 6%] from low dexmedetomidine. P> 0.05; 29%[39 to 18%] from baseline.

Such guidelines have to give special consideration to the fact that all measures concern not only the mother. but the fetus as well. Therefore. the optimum treatment of both must be targeted. A therapy favourable for the mother can be associated with an impairment of the child. and in extreme cases treatment measures which protect the survival of the mother can cause the death of the fetus.

26109,Insulin and myocardial blood flow,2003,Jan Sundell and Juhani Knuuti,57,,2,312-319,Elsevier Science,The renaissance of glucose–insulin–potassium infusion (GIK) as a treatment of acute myocardial infarction both in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects has raised new interests to clarify the effects and mechanisms of insulin on myocardium. Although the action of insulin on substrate metabolism is quite well studied in heart. the cardiovascular effects were until recent years poorly known. Insulin induces skeletal muscle vasodilation mainly via the endothelium-dependent mechanism and appears to have an important role in normal vascular function. There is increasing amount of evidence that insulin acts as a vasodilatory hormone also in coronary arteries. Insulin enhances myocardial blood flow and decreases coronary vascular resistance in a dose-dependent manner in healthy subjects. Moreover. insulin is able to increase myocardial blood flow also in subjects who are characterized by coronary dysfunction …,True,P663nvwAAAAJ:wGzT3bKASkAC,96,https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article-abstract/57/2/312/306547,16940200984895826498,/scholar?cites=16940200984895826498,,https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article/57/2/312/306547,0

The goals of diagnosing CAD are to direct specific therapy to alleviate symptoms of ischemia. to initiate appropriate steps to modify its risk factors. to retard its progression. and to improve patient outcomes. The diagnosis of CAD is also important in the selection of patients who need to be studied with invasive diagnostic methods (eg. coronary angiography). those with a high cardiac risk. those with a high need to know. and those with symptoms refractory to medical therapy.

Estimates of myocardial perfusion contain independent prognostic information about future major cardiac events and perfusion assessment is also useful in the monitoring of the effectiveness of risk reduction strategies. 1 The standard assessment of myocardial perfusion is based on its relative distribution. This approach has obvious limitations since the interpretation is based on the assumption that the best perfused region is normal and can be used as a reference. Using quantification this limitation can be avoided and using absolute parameters instead of relative ones is expected to provide benefits in several clinical scenarios.

MD,Virtually all tissues in the human body rely on aerobic metabolism for energy production and are therefore critically dependent on continuous supply of oxygen. Oxygen is provided by blood flow. and. in essence. changes in organ perfusion are also closely associated with alterations in tissue metabolism. In response to acute exercise. blood flow is markedly increased in contracting skeletal muscles and myocardium. but perfusion in other organs (brain and bone) is only slightly enhanced or is even reduced (visceral organs). Despite largely unchanged metabolism and perfusion. repeated exposures to altered hemodynamics and hormonal milieu produced by acute exercise. long-term exercise training appears to be capable of inducing effects also in tissues other than muscles that may yield health benefits.

In the present study. we tested whether glucose uptake is enhanced in trained men during low-. moderate-. and high-intensity exercise as compared with untrained men. METHODS: Seven trained and untrained men were studied without any dietary manipulation during bicycle exercise at relative intensities of 30%. 55%. and 75% of maximal oxygen consumption ([OV0312] O (2max)) on three separate days. Glucose uptake in the quadriceps femoris muscle was directly measured using positron emission tomography (PET) and 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose ([18F] FDG).[18F] FDG was injected 10 min after the start of the exercise. Thereafter exercise was continued for another 25 min. PET scanning was conducted immediately after completion of the exercise. The measured glucose uptake values reflect the situation during exercise due to chemical characteristics of the [18F] FDG.

Experimental studies suggest that in severe HF. cardiac metabolism reverts to a more fetal-like substrate use characterized by enhanced glucose and downregulated free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism. Correspondingly. in humans. when FFA levels are similar. myocardial glucose metabolism is increased. and FFA metabolism is decreased. However. depression of left ventricular function and insulin resistance induces a shift back to greater FFA uptake and oxidation by increasing circulating FFA availability. Myocardial insulin resistance may further impair myocardial glucose uptake and lead to an energy depletion state.

Therefore it is also clinically important to better understand the phenomenon that can be elucidated in humans non-invasively by positron emission tomography (PET) with measurements of spatial heterogeneity of glucose uptake within and among muscles during exercise. We studied six healthy young men during 35 minutes of cycling at relative intensities of 30% (low). 55% (moderate). and 75% (high) of maximal oxygen consumption on three separate days. Glucose uptake in the quadriceps femoris muscle group (QF). the main force producing muscle group in recreational cycling. and its four individual muscles. was directly measured using PET and 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose. Within-muscle heterogeneity was determined by calculating the coefficient of variance (CV) of glucose uptake in PET image voxels within the muscle of interest. and among-muscles heterogeneity of glucose uptake in QF was expressed as CV of the mean glucose uptake values of its separate muscles. With increasing intensity. within-muscle heterogeneity decreased in the entire QF as well as within its all four individual parts. Among-muscles glucose uptake heterogeneity also decreased with increasing intensity.

Since rupture-prone plaques commonly contain high amounts of activated macrophages. imaging of the macrophage content may provide a useful tool for the evaluation of plaque vulnerability. The purpose of this study was to explore the uptake of 68gallium (68Ga) in atherosclerotic plaques in mice. Uptake of ionic 68Ga was investigated in atherosclerotic LDLR-/-ApoB100/100 and C57BL/6N control mice at 3 h after injection. The ex vivo biodistribution of the 68Ga was assessed and autoradiography of aortic cryosections was defined. In vivo imaging of 68Ga was performed using a small animal positron emission tomography PET/CT scanner. Our results revealed that the uptake of 68Ga-radioactivity was higher in atherosclerotic plaques than in healthy vessel wall (ratio 1.8 ± 0.2. p = 0.0002) and adventitia (ratio 1.3 ± 0.2. p = 0.0011). The autoradiography signal co-localized with macrophages prominently as demonstrated by Mac-3 staining. In both mice strains. the highest level of radioactivity was found in the blood. We observed a moderate but significantly elevated 68Ga-radioactivity uptake in the aortic plaques of atherosclerotic mice. especially at the sites rich in macrophages. While the uptake of 68Ga was promising in this animal model. the slow blood clearance may limit the usability of 68Ga as a PET tracer for clinical imaging of atherosclerotic plaques.,True,P663nvwAAAAJ:IExZWSxeYXUC,33,https://ejnmmires.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2191-219X-1-14,3495647573153431759,/scholar?cites=3495647573153431759,,https://ejnmmires.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2191-219X-1-14,0

26292,Is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging causing DNA damage?,2013,Juhani Knuuti and Antti Saraste and Marko Kallio and Heikki Minn,34,,30,2337-2339,Oxford University Press,Cardiac imaging is increasingly used to detect heart diseases and to guide therapy. Along with the increased use of cardiac imaging at clinics there is increased attention to the potential risks related to the methods used. Currently imaging tests using ultrasound or magnetic fields have been regarded safer alternatives compared with the tests utilizing ionizing radiation such as X-rays. computed tomography (CT). and nuclear imaging. 1 However. various sources of risks related to. for example. exercise testing. pharmacological stressors. contrast agents. the imaging procedures themselves. invasive procedures. and cumulative ionizing radiation should all be taken into account collectively and ultimately weighed against the risks related to undetected disease or delayed diagnosis.Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging relies on three different types of low-frequency electromagnetic waves: a static magnetic field. radiofrequency (RF) pulses. and gradient magnetic fields. Potential risks associated with MR may derive from the effects of each component on biological tissues and mainly on ferromagnetic objects. The latter is a well-known limitation of MR that can be avoided by appropriate patient selection. ie exclusion of patients with any metal object in their body. A strong static magnetic field as such is unlikely to cause significant adverse biological effects. although sporadic and transient sensations of nausea and dizziness have been reported. The RF energy delivered to the body may cause heating of tissues. 2 The amount of RF energy delivered is defined as the specific absorption rate (SAR). To avoid significant heating. clinical scanners are set to …,True,P663nvwAAAAJ:uEM9VtRl8xsC,24,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.682.9465&rep=rep1&type=pdf,2520169954063200314,/scholar?cites=2520169954063200314,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.682.9465&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

Methods and Results: The subcutaneous adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF) was measured in 9 healthy young men by positron emission tomography using radiowater tracer. Subcutaneous ATBF was determined in regions adjacent to knee extensors at rest and during dynamic knee extensor exercise. and with 2 physiological perturbations: while breathing moderate systemic hypoxic air (14% O 2) at rest and during exercise. and during intra-femoral artery infusion of high-dose adenosine infusion. ATBF was 1.3±0.6 ml· 100g–1· min–1 at rest and increased with exercise (8.0±3.0 ml· 100g–1· min–1. P< 0.001) and adenosine infusion (10.5±4.9 ml· 100g–1· min–1. P= 0.001). but not when breathing moderate systemic hypoxic air (1.5±0.4 ml· 100g–1· min–1). ATBF was similar during exercise and adenosine infusion. but vascular conductance was lower during adenosine infusion. Finally. ATBF during exercise in moderate systemic hypoxia was reduced (6.3±2.2 ml· 100g–1· min–1) compared to normoxic exercise (P= 0.004). Conclusions: The vasodilatation capacity of human subcutaneous adipose blood flow appears to be comparable to. or even higher. than that induced by moderate intensity exercise. Furthermore. the reduced blood flow response in subcutaneous adipose tissue during systemic hypoxia is likely to contribute. in part. to the redistribution of blood flow to exercising muscle in a condition of reduced oxygen availability.(Circ J …,True,P663nvwAAAAJ:wZJMF1LD7PcC,22,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/circj/78/6/78_CJ-13-1273/_article/-char/ja/,3135883619478409659,/scholar?cites=3135883619478409659,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/circj/78/6/78_CJ-13-1273/_pdf,0

26319,Spotlight on metabolic remodelling in heart failure,2011,Torsten Doenst and E Dale Abel,90,,2,191-193,Oxford University Press,The term ‘remodelling’has been abundantly used in the context of heart failure with many different meanings. 1–3 It was originally described in a rat model as the structural and functional response of the remote heart muscle to a local infarct caused by the occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. 4 Thereafter. a plethora of experimental and clinical studies have addressed mechanisms of remodelling and the concept is widely linked to the development of heart failure. 5 However. metabolic aspects of remodelling have until recently been less well investigated. The development of new molecular techniques. including diverse approaches to global analysis of gene expression 6. 7 and broad-based approaches such as proteomics and metabolomics 8–10 has provided a wealth of new information on underlying mechanisms.

The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) expression is upregulated in activated macrophages. representing a potential target to identify inflamed atherosclerotic plaques. We preclinically evaluated 18F-GE-180. a novel third-generation TSPO radioligand. in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. Methods. Nine hypercholesterolemic mice deficient in low density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein B48 (LDLR−/−ApoB100/100) and six healthy C57BL/6N mice were injected with 10 MBq of 18F-GE-180. Specificity of binding was demonstrated in three LDLR−/−ApoB100/100 mice by injection of nonradioactive reference compound of 18F-GE-180 before 18F-GE-180. Dynamic 30-minute PET was performed followed by contrast-enhanced CT. and the mice were sacrificed at 60 minutes after injection. Tissue samples were obtained for ex vivo biodistribution measurements. and aortas were cut into serial cryosections for digital autoradiography. The presence of macrophages and TSPO was studied by immunohistochemistry. The 18F-GE-180 retention in plaque areas with different macrophage densities and lesion-free vessel wall were compared. Results. The LDLR−/−ApoB100/100 mice showed large. inflamed plaques in the aorta.

However. cardiotoxicity is of increasing concern. with a need to develop rational mechanism driven approaches for the early detection of cardiac dysfunction. We sought to interrogate changes in cardiac energy substrate usage during sunitinib treatment. hypothesising that these changes could represent a strategy for the early detection of cardiotoxicity. Balb/CJ mice or Sprague-Dawley rats were treated orally for 4 weeks with 40 or 20 mg/kg/day sunitinib. Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) was implemented to investigate alterations in myocardial glucose and oxidative metabolism. Following treatment. blood pressure increased. and left ventricular ejection fraction decreased. Cardiac [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET revealed increased glucose uptake after 48 hours. [11C]Acetate-PET showed decreased myocardial perfusion following treatment. Electron microscopy revealed significant lipid accumulation in the myocardium. Proteomic analyses indicated that oxidative metabolism. fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction were among the top myocardial signalling pathways perturbed. Sunitinib treatment results in an increased reliance on glycolysis. increased myocardial lipid deposition and perturbed mitochondrial function. indicative of a fundamental energy crisis resulting in compromised myocardial energy metabolism and function.

Its deficiency caused by point mutations in the MBL gene has recently been associated with severe atherosclerosis. In this study. we investigated the effect of MBL variant alleles on coronary artery reactivity. which is an early marker of coronary dysfunction and predicts the development of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. The study population consisted of 51 apparently healthy. normo- or mildly hypercholesterolemic young men. Myocardial blood flow was measured at baseline and during adenosine-induced hyperemia with positron emission tomography (PET). and MBL genotyping was performed using restriction fragment-length polymorphism.

Previous human studies have shown contradictory results in functional myocardial vascular adaptations to exercise training. and we hypothesized that this may be related to different degrees of hypertrophy in the trained heart. Methods: We studied the interrelationships between peak aerobic power (VO2peak). myocardial blood flow (MBF) at rest and during adenosine-induced vasodilation. and parameters of myocardial hypertrophy in endurance-trained (ET. n= 31) and untrained (n= 17) subjects. MBF and myocardial hypertrophy were studied using positron emission tomography and echocardiography. respectively. Results: Both VO2peak (P G 0.001) and left ventricular (LV) mass index (P G 0.001) were higher in the ET group. Basal MBF was similar between the groups. MBF during adenosine was significantly lower in the ET group (2.88 T 1.01 vs 3.64 T 1.11 mLIgj1Iminj1. P G 0.05) but not when the difference in LV mass was taken into account. VO2peak correlated negatively with adenosine-stimulated MBF. but when LV mass was taken into account as a partial correlate. this correlation disappeared.

26411,Advances in clinical application of quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging,2012,Juhani Knuuti and Antti Saraste,19,,4,643-646,Springer-Verlag,Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is well-established and the most widely used noninvasive imaging method for the detection of myocardial ischemia. Numerous studies have shown that the diagnostic accuracy of MPI for the detection of angiographically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) is high and that normal MPI in patients with intermediate-to-high likelihood of CAD predicts a very low rate of cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). These features make MPI a strong technique to guide selection of patients for revascularization. The standard interpretation of MPI is based on the assessment of relative myocardial perfusion defects. This method of defining regional reductions in uptake relative to the maximum in the left ventricle myocardium has some limitations in the detection of ischemia.

Evaluation of myocardial glucose metabolism by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is considered the most sensitive tool to detect viability. and it predicts functional recovery as well as improved prognosis upon revascularisation. In parallel with the improved availability of PET. scanners have been changed into hybrid devices consisting of both multidetector computed tomography (CT) and PET (PET-CT). The immediate benefit for viability imaging is the ability to merge the coronary CT angiography images with FDG PET viability data. In addition. the possibility to utilise CT for myocardial viability imaging. such as delayed-enhancement imaging of myocardial infarction with acceptable radiation dose has been intensely investigated. This review will describe the principles of viability assessment by PET. and discuss the possibilities provided by hybrid PET-CT in this setting.,True,P663nvwAAAAJ:dMpQl7XwOw4C,8,https://europepmc.org/article/med/20542819,16351371735711946492,/scholar?cites=16351371735711946492,,,0
26428,Dual gating method for eliminating motion-related inaccuracies in cardiac PET,2007,Tommi Kokki and Mika Teras and Hannu T Sipila and Tommi Noponen and Juhani Knuuti,5,,,3871-3875,IEEE,The aim of this study was to develop gating method that eliminates both respiratory and cardiac motion-related inaccuracies in cardiac PET images utilizing two independent trigger events on PET list mode (LM) data without count loss. The method is based on an idea that two independent triggers are sent periodically into LM data based on respiratory and electrocardiogram (ECG) cycles. This enables separation of dual gated LM data into subgroups which each contain events from certain respiratory and cardiac phase. Two additional assumptions are made: amplitude of respiratory movement as well respiratory triggers are available. and only the last diastolic time interval of cardiac cycle varies due to heart rate instability.

26444,Transport of carbon-11-methionine is enhanced by insulin,1997,Uno Wegelius and Eeva Salminen,38,J Nucl Med,,1967-1970,,The anabolic effects of insulin are not restricted to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism but also include protein metabolism. However. the effects of insulin on protein metabolism have been difficult to demonstrate in vivo. Amino acid transport is partly regulated by insulin according to the experimental data. PET provides a way to measure fractional uptake rates of amino acids. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of insulin on amino acid transport from the plasma to the human parotid glands. Methods: We compared the uptake of L-[methyl-11C] methionine ([11C] methionine) into the parotid glands and cerebellum in seven healthy volunteers during the fasting state and euglycemic insulin clamp technique (1 mil/kg per minute). Results: The fractional uptake rate of [11C] methionine was increased by 31% for the right parotid gland (p= 0.003) and by 29% for the left parotid gland (p= 0.009) during insulin clamp. while the increase was 19% for the cerebellum (p= 0.01). The concentration of amino acids typical for the hormonesensitive transport system A was 11% lower during insulin infusion than in the fasting state. Conclusion: The uptake of methionine into brain tissue does not seem to be under major control by insulin. while the transport of methionine in the parotid glands is stimulated by insulin.

Distribution of intravenously-injected MMP-2/9-targeting peptide.[68 Ga] Ga-DOTA-TCTP-1. was studied by combined positron emission tomography (PET) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). At 60 min post-injection. aortas were cut into cryosections for autoradiography analysis of tracer uptake. histology. and immunohistochemistry. Zymography was used to assess MMP-2/9 activation and pre-treatment with MMP-2/9 inhibitor to assess the specificity of tracer uptake. Results: Tracer uptake was not visible by in vivo PET/CT in the atherosclerotic aorta. but ex vivo autoradiography revealed 1.8±0.34 times higher tracer uptake in atherosclerotic plaques than in normal vessel wall (p= 0.0029). Tracer uptake in plaques correlated strongly with the quantity of Mac-3-positive macrophages (R= 0.91. p< 0.001). but weakly with MMP-9 staining (R= 0.40. p= 0.099). Zymography showed MMP-2 activation in the aorta. and pre-treatment with MMP-2/9 inhibitor decreased tracer uptake by 55%(p= 0.0020). Conclusions: The MMP-2/9-targeting [68 Ga] Ga-DOTA-TCTP-1 shows specific uptake in inflamed atherosclerotic lesions; however. a low target-to-background ratio precluded in vivo vascular imaging.

We investigated whether this injury could be attenuated by thymosin beta 4. a peptide which has showed cardioprotective effects. Pigs received either thymosin beta 4 or placebo and underwent cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping for 60 minutes with cold intermittent blood-cardioplegia and were then followed for 30 hours. Myocardial function and blood flow was studied by cardiac magnetic resonance and PET imaging. Tissue and plasma samples were analyzed to determine the amount of cardiomyocyte necrosis and apoptosis as well as pharmacokinetics of the peptide. In vitro studies were performed to assess its influence on blood coagulation and vasomotor tone. Serum levels of the peptide were increased after administration compared to control samples. Thymosin beta 4 did not decrease the amount of cell death. Cardiac function and global myocardial blood flow was similar between the study groups. At high doses a vasoconstrictor effect on mesentery arteries and a vasodilator effect on coronary arteries was observed and blood clot firmness was reduced when tested in the presence of an antiplatelet agent.

Though invasive coronary angiography (ICA) remains the gold standard for anatomical assessment of coronary artery disease in HF patients. alternatives are being sought. Computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTA) has emerged as an accurate non-invasive diagnostic tool for coronary artery disease (CAD) and has been demonstrated to have prognostic value. Whether or not CTA can be used in HF patients is unknown. Acknowledging the aging population. the growing prevalence of HF and the increasing financial burden of healthcare. we need to identify non-invasive diagnostic tests that are available. safe. accurate and cost-effective. The proposed study aims to provide insight into the efficacy of CTA in HF patients. A multicenter randomized controlled trial will enroll 250 HF patients requiring coronary anatomical definition. Enrolled patients will be randomized to either CTA or ICA (n = 125 per group) as the first test to define coronary anatomy. The primary outcomes will be collected to determine downstream resource utilization. Secondary outcomes will include the composite clinical events and major adverse cardiac events. In addition. the accuracy of CTA for detecting coronary anatomy and obstruction will be assessed in patients who subsequently undergo both CTA and ICA. It is expected that CTA will be a more cost-effective strategy for diagnosis: yielding similar outcomes with fewer procedural risks and improved resource utilization.

26469,Intensity of 18F-FDG PET Uptake in Culture-Negative and Culture-Positive Cases of Chronic Osteomyelitis,2017,Petteri Lankinen and Marko Seppänen and Kimmo Mattila and Markku Kallajoki and Juhani Knuuti and Hannu T Aro,2017,Contrast media & molecular imaging,,,Hindawi,Microbiologic cultures are not infrequently negative in patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis. Culture-negative cases may represent low-grade infections with a lower metabolic activity than culture-positive cases. 18F-FDG PET could potentially detect such a difference. We determined whether the level of 18F-FDG PET uptake differs in patients with culture-negative and culture-positive osteomyelitis. We reviewed the clinical charts of 40 consecutive patients. who had diagnostic 18F-FDG PET for a suspected bone infection. Twenty-six patients were eligible with a confirmed diagnosis based on microbiologic cultures and/or histopathologic examination. Sixteen of 26 patients had chronic osteomyelitis. Eight of them had positive cultures. seven had negative cultures. and one patient had no cultures of the biopsy specimen. The patients with histologically and/or microbiologically proven osteomyelitis were correctly interpreted as true positive in the routine clinical reading of 18F-FDG PET images. There was no relationship between the level of 18F-FDG PET uptake and the presence of positive or negative bacterial cultures. The result favors the concept that that culture-negative cases of osteomyelitis are false-negative infections due to nonculturable microbes. 18F-FDG PET may help to confirm the presence of metabolically active infection in these patients and guide their appropriate treatment.,True,P663nvwAAAAJ:JjBZBFkNMTQC,5,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmi/2017/9754293/abs/,4688090401926142121,/scholar?cites=4688090401926142121,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmi/2017/9754293/abs/,0

Echocardiography is a first-line test in HF given its availability and it provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is an emerging clinical tool in the management of patients with non-ischemic heart failure. Current ACC/AHA/CCS/ESC guidelines advocate its role in the detection of a variety of cardiomyopathies but there is a paucity of high quality evidence to support these recommendations. The primary objective of this study is to compare the diagnostic yield of routine cardiac magnetic resonance versus standard care (that is. echocardiography with only selective use of CMR) in patients with non-ischemic heart failure. The primary hypothesisis that the routine use of CMR will lead to a more specific diagnostic characterization of the underlying etiology of non-ischemic heart failure. This will lead to a reduction in the non-specific diagnoses of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and HF with preserved ejection fraction. Tertiary care sites in Canada and Finland. with dedicated HF and CMR programs. will randomize consecutive patients with new or deteriorating HF to routine CMR or selective CMR. All patients will undergo a standard clinical echocardiogram and the interpreter will assign the most likely HF etiology. Those undergoing CMR will also have a standard examination and will be assigned a HF etiology based upon the findings. The treating physician’s impression about non-ischemic HF etiology will be collected following all baseline testing (including echo ± CMR).

A glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) has been used to detect atherosclerotic inflammation. However. it is not known to what extent [18F]FDG is taken up in different stages of atherosclerosis. We aimed to study the uptake of [18F]FDG to various stages of coronary plaques in a pig model.   Methods First. diabetes was caused by streptozotocin injections (50 mg/kg for 3 days) in farm pigs (n = 10). After 6 months on high-fat diet. pigs underwent dual-gated cardiac PET/CT to measure [18F]FDG uptake in coronary arteries. Coronary segments (n = 33) were harvested for ex vivo measurement of radioactivity and autoradiography (ARG).   Results Intimal thickening was observed in 16 segments and atheroma type plaques in 10 segments. Compared with the normal vessel wall. ARG showed 1.7±0.7 times higher [18F]FDG accumulation in the intimal thickening and 4.1±2.3 times higher in the atheromas (P = 0.004 and P = 0.003. respectively). Ex vivo mean vessel-to-blood ratio was higher in segments with atheroma than those without atherosclerosis (2.6±1.2 vs. 1.3±0.7. P = 0.04). In vivo PET imaging showed the highest target-to-background ratio (TBR) of 2.7. However. maximum TBR was not significantly different in segments without atherosclerosis (1.1±0.5) and either intimal thickening (1.2±0.4. P = 1.0) or atheroma (1.6±0.6. P = 0.4).

26499,Cardiac hybrid imaging with low radiation dose,2008,Juhani Knuuti,15,Journal of Nuclear Cardiology,6,743,Springer Nature BV,Cardiac hybrid imaging has gained a lot of interest and enthusiasm recently. 1 It is indeed quite obvious that combined imaging of coronary anatomy and perfusion is a very powerful technique in the diagnosis of coronary heart disease but especially for therapy decisions. There are several constraints that have prevented the use of hybrid imaging in the clinical routine. First. we do not know in which kind of patient populations this technique should be used. While awaiting larger trials to be published. we need to apply current knowledge about stand-alone cardiac computed tomography (CT) and perfusion imaging. Increasing evidence suggests that cardiac CT has a high negative predictive value in detecting coronary heart disease whereas the positive predictive value is suboptimal.

Methods: Thirty non-smoking healthy men (age 34±6 years) were studied: 9 had increased lipoprotein (a)(> 200 mg/L) concentrations (lipoprotein (a) 317 (range 218–550) mg/L) and 21 had normal lipoprotein (a)(< 200 mg/L) concentrations (lipoprotein (a) 57 (range 13–156) mg/L). The myocardial blood flow measurements were performed basally and during adenosine infusion (140 μg/kg/min) with or without simultaneous physiological hyperinsulinemia (insulin infusion at a rate of 1 mU/kg/min) using positron emission tomography and [15 O] H 2 O. Results: Basal myocardial blood flow was similar between the subjects with increased and normal lipoprotein (a)(0.76±0.20 and 0.79±0.20 mL g− 1 min− 1. NS).

The autonomic nervous system plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac function. and the regional distribution of cardiac nerve terminals can be visualised using scintigraphic techniques. A number of labelled analogues of norepinephrine have been investigated but the most commonly used PET tracer is [11C] hydroxyephedrine. In patients with heart failure secondary to either ischaemic heart disease or cardiomyopathy. reduced myocardial retention of the tracer is an adverse prognostic sign. presumably indicating advanced disease with denervation.

The aim of this study was to compare MBF determined by a traditional dual bolus method against a modified dual bolus approach and to evaluate both methods against PET in a porcine model of myocardial ischemia. Local myocardial ischemia was induced in five pigs. which were subsequently examined with contrast enhanced MRI (gadoteric acid) and PET (O-15 water). In the determination of MBF. the initial high concentration AIF was corrected using the ratio of low and high contrast AIF areas. normalized according to the corresponding heart rates. MBF was determined from the MRI. during stress and at rest. using the dual bolus and the modified dual bolus methods in 24 segments of the myocardium (total of 240 segments. five pigs in stress and rest). Due to image artifacts and technical problems 53% of the segments had to be rejected from further analyses. These two estimates were later compared against respective rest and stress PET-based MBF measurements. Values of MBF were determined for 112/240 regions.

Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) presents amyloid-like structural properties. and different amyloid species have recently been recognized in atherosclerotic plaques. Therefore. we studied the uptake of the amyloid imaging agent [18 F] Flutemetamol in atherosclerotic plaques. The binding of [18 F] Flutemetamol to human carotid artery plaque was studied in vitro. In vivo uptake of the tracer was studied in hypercholesterolemic IGF-II/LDLR−/− ApoB 100/100 mice and C57BL/6N controls. Tracer biodistribution was studied in vivo with PET/CT. and ex vivo by gamma counter and digital ex vivo autoradiography. The presence of amyloid. ox-LDL. and macrophages in the plaques was examined by immunohistochemistry.[18 F] Flutemetamol showed specific accumulation in human carotid plaque. especially in areas positive for amyloid beta. The aortas of IGF-II/LDLR−/− ApoB 100/100 mice showed large thioflavin-S-positive atherosclerotic plaques containing ox-LDL and macrophages. Autoradiography revealed 1.7-fold higher uptake in the plaques than in a lesion-free vessel wall. but no difference in aortic tissue uptake between mouse strains were observed in the in vivo PET/CT.

Male farm pigs with surgical occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (n = 9) or sham operation (n = 5) had transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac-CT 3 months after surgery. We measured length of the LV in parasternal long axis view. and both systolic and diastolic LV areas in parasternal short axis views at the level of mitral valve. papillary muscles and apex. Volumes and EF of the LV were calculated using Simpson’s method of discs (tri-plane area) or Cylinder-hemiellipsoid method (single plane area). The pigs with coronary occlusion had anterior MI scars and reduced EF (average EF 42 ± 10%) by CT. Measurements of LV volumes and EF were reproducible by echocardiography. Compared with CT. end-diastolic volume (EDV) measured by echocardiography showed good correlation and agreement using either Simpson’s method (r = 0.90; mean difference −2. 95% CI −47 to 43 mL) or Cylinder-hemiellipsoid method (r = 0.94; mean difference 3. 95% CI −44 to 49 mL).

Whereas CT provides non-invasive assessment of coronary lumen and wall. PET perfusion is a reliable method for the evaluation of myocardial flow. CT. although very capable of ruling out significant coronary artery disease. is less than satisfactory in assessing the actual significance of the detected lesions. PET imaging. despite its excellent sensitivity. fails to describe the exact anatomy of the epicardial vessels. By fusing image data from these two modalities. lesions can be accurately correlated with their physiological or anatomical counterparts. Hybrid PET-CT devices. now in wide clinical use. allow such fusion in a one-stop-shop study.

FR-β expression in central nervous system inflammation remains relatively unexplored. Therefore. we used focally induced acute and chronic phases of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to study patterns of FR-β expression and evaluated its potential as an in vivo imaging target. Focal EAE was induced in rats using heat-killed Bacillus Calmette-Guérin followed by activation with complete Freund’s adjuvant supplemented with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The rats were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) at acute (14 days) and chronic (90 days) phases of inflammation. The animals were finally sacrificed for ex vivo autoradiography of their brains. PET studies were performed using FR-β-targeting aluminum [18F]fluoride-labeled 1.4.7-triazacyclononane-1.4.7-triacetic acid conjugated folate ([18F]AlF-NOTA-folate. 18F-FOL) and 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO)-targeting N-acetyl-N-(2-[11C]methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine (11C-PBR28).

Similarly. tissue characterization with cardiovascular magnetic resonance techniques (late gadolinium enhancement and T1-mapping) has become an important part in the diagnostic algorithms and risk stratification of patients with cardiomyopathies. In addition. assessment of coronary artery disease with computed tomography (CT) is changing from being exclusively an anatomical test to integrating anatomic (lesion severity and plaque characterization) with functional information (myocardial perfusion and coronary fractional flow reserve) whereas the prognostic implications of quantification of coronary flow reserve with positron emission tomography (PET) have been demonstrated in large scale studies. Technological advances in fusion imaging. such as PET/CT and PET/magnetic resonance. allow for relating anatomical tissue changes with functional alterations in the clinical and pre-clinical setting. Finally. the use of machine learning applied to imaging data to predict cardiovascular events is increasing.

26553,Perfusion imaging and coronary anatomy,2015,Juhani Knuuti and Antti Saraste,16,,9,966-967,Oxford University Press,Myocardial perfusion imaging is a functional test that does not provide information about coronary artery anatomy. However. the most common indication for perfusion imaging is to detect coronary artery disease (CAD) and more specifically identify significant stenosis in the large epicardial arteries. Therefore. when reporting the perfusion imaging. the results are commonly assigned to vascular territories supplied by the main coronary arteries. This assignment is mostly based on standard myocardial segments that are assigned to three myocardial regions typically supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). left circumflex coronary artery (LCX). or right coronary artery (RCA). 1 While doing this. it is well known that this assignment is subject to errors since individual coronary anatomy varies a lot. The most well-known variability is the dominance of either right or left coronary tree. This leads to individual variability in blood supply to lateral and inferior left ventricle walls. Less commonly acknowledged variability deals with the anterolateral wall (LAD vs. LCX) and septum (LAD vs. RCA). The study by Thomassen et al. 2 investigated whether the assignment of perfusion findings with the coronary anatomy using the standard segmental model rather than true individual anatomy will have impact on the accuracy of the imaging test. The authors analysed PET perfusion images of 44 patients with suspected CAD using both standard segment assignment and individual assignment.

New techniques such as computed tomography have been introduced. but also the use of more established techniques such as nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has been growing globally. The potential risks of imaging have recently been actively discussed. These risks include the imaging procedures themself. the stressors used. the contrast agents. and the ionizing radiation. Although the use of more non-invasive methods is probably increasing patient safety. concerns due to other risks have been raised. 1One of the risk components is that related to ionizing radiation. 1. 2 In many situations such as in the elderly or in patients with low life expectancy. the risk of radiation is exceedingly small and radiation is not the main issue when an imaging test is selected. Although the risk of radiation caused by imaging may be considered similar to many other risks of imaging and normal life activities. and much less than those of the disease itself. it cannot be disregarded.

Vammin is a snake venom derived vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and a selective VEGF receptor-2 ligand. The aim of this study was to determine whether an adenoviral vammin gene transfer induces angiogenesis or affects the perfusion or function of porcine myocardium during normoxia and chronic myocardial ischemia. Methods: Gene transfers were done as 15 intramyocardial injections using a needle catheter with rising doses of adenoviral (Ad) vammin using AdCMV as a control. Angiography and positron emission tomography were used to measure the effects of the treatment on angiogenesis and myocardial perfusion. and cardiac ultrasound and modified Miles assay on tissue edema and permeability.

Methods We developed and tested an optimized novel method to measure MBF. OEF. and MVO2 simultaneously both in the RV and LV free wall (FW) using positron emission tomography in healthy young men at rest and during supine bicycle exercise. Results Resting MBF was not significantly different between the three myocardial regions. Exercise increased MBF in the LVFW and septum. but MBF was lower in the RV compared to septum and LVFW during exercise. Resting OEF was similar between the three different myocardial regions (~70%) and increased in response to exercise similarly in all regions. MVO2 increased approximately two to three times from rest to exercise in all myocardial regions. but was significantly lower in the RV during exercise as compared to septum LVFW. Conclusion MBF. OEF and MVO2 can be assessed simultaneously in the RV and LV myocardia at rest and during exercise. Although there are no major differences in the MBF and OEF between LV and RV myocardial regions in the resting myocardium. MVO2 per gram of myocardium appears to be lower the RV in the exercising healthy human heart due to lower mean blood flow.

Single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI) has been widely used to detect silent ischemia in such patients. However. randomized controlled trials showed no survival benefit of CAD screening in diabetic patients. but were limited by protocol issues and low event rates. Thus. the usefulness of such a screening remains controversial. Purpose: To further evaluate the prognostic value of testing for silent ischaemia. we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the actual literature about risk stratification in asymptomatic diabetic patients undergoing SPECT-MPI. Methods: We systematically searched 5 online databases (PubMed. Embase. Scopus. Web of Science. and Cochrane library) and reference lists of 25 recent reviews for appropriate studies.

Treatment with RAS inhibitors can reduce LV remodeling and improve clinical outcomes. Since there are significant differences in the activation levels of myocardial and systemic RAS. a monitoring system of the RAS activation at tissue level could be useful. Molecular imaging of increased myocardial angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity or angiotensin II type 1 –receptor (AT1R) upregulation might identify patients at risk of developing heart failure or optimize treatment of heart failure. Experimental studies using PET and SPECT imaging with radiolabeled ligands have shown feasibility of non-invasive detection of ACE or AT1R upregulation in the heart after myocardial infarction.

There is a need for novel medical therapies independent of the neurohormonal axis that improve cardiac performance. Experimental and preliminary clinical studies have demonstrated that metabolic modulators enhancing myocardial glucose metabolism directly or indirectly by limiting free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism. may improve left ventricular (LV) function in HF. This paper reviews the literature on the effects of metabolic modulators on human HF (both ischemic and idiopathic).

One of the first clinical applications of PET was the assessment of myocardial viability. and it has been generally regarded as the gold standard technique for this indication. The most common approach with PET is comparing myocardial metabolism and perfusion using FDG and ammonia or other perfusion tracers. 1 It has been shown that PET can predict regional and global recovery of wall motion. symptoms. functional outcome. and prognosis after revascularization. Also. other tracers and newer techniques are available. such as gating and hybrid imaging using PET/computed tomography (CT) scanners.

The labelling of MIBG with 123-iodine permits visualisation of myocardial sympathetic neuronal uptake. MIBG is a false neurotransmitter. an analogue of norepinephrine. which uses similar uptake mechanisms in the pre-synaptic nerve terminals as norepinephrine. The tracer is primarily transported into the pre-synaptic nerve terminal by sodium-and ATP-dependent transporters. referred to as uptake-1. In the nerve terminal. no degradation of MIBG takes place. resulting in an accumulation of MIBG with high signal intensity. These signals are used for planar and tomographic (SPECT) imaging. Early planar and SPECT imaging is performed at 10–20 minutes after MIBG administration. whereas delayed planar and SPECT imaging are performed three to four hours after tracer injection. From planar images. global cardiac MIBG uptake can be assessed visually or semi-quantitatively using early and late heart–mediastinum (H/M) ratio (see Figure 1). To calculate H/M ratio. regions of interest are manually drawn over the heart and upper mediastinum and the mean of myocardial counts per pixel is divided by the mean of mediastinal counts per pixel. Another planar-based parameter is the cardiac wash-out rate. which indicates the rate by which MIBG is released from the myocardium between early and delayed imaging. To calculate cardiac wash-out rate. late H/M ratio is subtracted from the early H/M ratio and divided by the early H/M ratio.These planar-based parameters have been studied extensively in HF …,True,P663nvwAAAAJ:CLhUwle04lcC,1,https://www.ecrjournal.com/system/files/articles/boogers_0.pdf,15325285210750894477,/scholar?cites=15325285210750894477,,https://www.ecrjournal.com/system/files/articles/boogers_0.pdf,0

26633,PET imaging of heart and skeletal muscle: An overview,2007,Juhani Knuuti,,"Cardiovascular Molecular Imaging. New York, NY: Informa Healthcare USA, Inc",,319-324,,Free fatty acids (FFA). glucose and lactate are the main fuels of the heart (1–2). In addition. ketone bodies and amino acids are used in lesser extent. Several factors affect the use of an individual substrate. These include the plasma concentration of the substrate and alternate substrates. myocardial blood flow and oxygen supply. hormone levels and regulatory effects of metabolites arising during degradation of substrates (1). Under normal resting conditions. metabolism is oxidative with FFA being the major source. while carbohydrates contribute only about 30% of substrate to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (2). Dietary and hormonal conditions markedly affect the selection of substrates by the heart. For example. in the fasting state. FFA levels are high and glucose and insulin levels are low. Consequently. the rate of myocardial FFA oxidation is high and inhibits glycolysis and glucose oxidation. After ingestion of carbohydrates however. glucose and insulin plasma concentrations rise. Insulin reduces peripheral lipolysis. thereby lowering plasma concentrations of FFA further and. hence. their availability to the myocardium. Glucose then becomes the dominant substrate for myocardial energy production. During physiological exercise. when lactate concentrations rise. lactate will become a significant fuel for the heart (3). Like lactate. the uptake of ketone bodies is concentration dependent and their use is increased in uncontrolled diabetes and starvation (2). Amino acid oxidation is enhanced after a protein-rich meal. when their use can account for an increasing amount of total myocardial oxygen consumption (2).

26666,From fallacies to reality: Focus on fractional flow reserve,2020,Emanuele Barbato and Juhani Knuuti and William Wijns,319,International Journal of Cardiology,,61,Elsevier,Dr. Soares raised concerns over FFR in recent ESC guidelines on chronic coronary syndromes [1. 2]. Soares and Brown are doubtful that revascularization has any effect on outcomes. even in the presence of ischemia. Indeed. only FFR-guided revascularization reduces spontaneous myocardial infarction. recurrent ischemic episodes and repeat revascularizations [3]. Revascularization should be considered when unequivocal evidence of a correlation between the stenosis and related large area of ischemic myocardium is present. evidence that is easily obtainable by FFR [2]. Secondly. FFR does not tell whether symptoms are related to chronic microvascular disease. Yet. a preserved FFR in a tight stenosis raises suspicion that symptoms are caused by microvascular disease. discouraging inappropriate stent implantation. hence unnecessary procedurerelated harm.

However. the selection of optimal number of gates for gating remains a challenge. Selecting too high number of gates results in a loss of signal-to-noise ratio. while too low number of gates does remove only part of the motion. Here. we introduce a respiratory-cardiac motion model to determine the optimal number of respiratory and cardiac gates. We evaluate the model using a realistic heart phantom and data from 12 cardiac patients (47–77 years. 64.5 on average). To demonstrate the benefits of our model. we compared it with an existing respiratory model.

Here. we report the radiosynthesis and preclinical evaluation of [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-folate (68Ga-FOL). First. we determined the affinity of 68Ga-FOL using human FR-β expressing cells. Then. we studied atherosclerotic mice with 68Ga-FOL and 18F-FDG PET/CT. After sacrifice. the tissues excised were measured with a γ-counter for ex vivo biodistribution. Further. the tracer distribution and co-localization with macrophages in aorta cryosections were studied using autoradiography. hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunostaining with anti-Mac-3 antibody. Specificity of 68Ga-FOL was assessed in a blocking study with excess of folate glucosamine. As a last step. human radiation doses were extrapolated from rat PET data. We were able to produce 68Ga-FOL at high radioactivity concentration. with high molar activity and radiochemical purity. The cell binding studies showed high (5.1 ± 1.1 nM) affinity of 68Ga-FOL to FR-β. The myocardial uptake of 68Ga-FOL (SUV 0.43 ± 0.06) was 20-folds lower compared to 18F-FDG (SUV 10.6 ± 1.8. P = 0.001). The autoradiography and immunohistochemistry of aorta revealed that 68Ga-FOL radioactivity co-localized with Mac-3-positive macrophage-rich atherosclerotic plaques. The plaque-to-healthy vessel wall ratio of 68Ga-FOL (2.44 ± 0.15) was significantly higher than that of 18F-FDG (1.93 ± 0.22. P = 0.005). Blocking studies verified 68Ga-FOL specificity to FR.

Studies with knock-out mice have revealed an active role for PAPP-A in atherosclerotic plaque progression [2]. Especially the enzymatically active free form of PAPP-A (fPAPP-A) is found in arterial plaques. and as a circulating biomarker is associated with the risk of adverse cardiovascular events [3. 4]. fPAPP-A attaches to cell surfaces as cell surface glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) interact with the GAG binding site of fPAPP-A [5]. However. cell culture studies have shown that addition of heparin reverses this binding [5]. Intravenous heparin. both low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin (UFH). is known to rapidly increase fPAPP-A concentration in the circulation in humans [6–8].

Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium fluoride (NaF) is an imaging modality capable of showing ongoing calcium deposition in vivo. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of NaF-PET/CT performed in this category of patients one month after treatment with non-instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion. Method: 18 patients (median 66.5 years. range 60-78. 13 females) underwent 90-minute NaF-PET/CT one month after surgery for degenerative spondylosis. Fusion status was determined using high resolution CT within a year of surgery. Clinical characteristics including walking distance. VAS score of back pain (VAS-B). Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire (ODI). and European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) were assessed before surgery and 1 year after. The changes in clinical parameters between the time points were compared with the graft NaF uptake in each patient. Results: Only 4 of 18 patients experienced fusion. which was bilateral and multilevel in all four. The graft uptake in fused patients was 1178 (961-1279) SUV compared to 1333 (474-27817) SUV in non-fused patients (p= 0.93). The corresponding partial volume corrected values were 1282 (962-9535) SUV and 1341 (481-27842) SUV (p= 0.35). Fused patients showed a median increase in walking distance of 737 (0-985) meters compared to 855 (360-985) in non-fused patients (p= 0.29). a median decrease in VAS-B of 4.3 (0-8.3) vs 3.8 (0.1-8.5)(p= 0.92). a median decrease in ODI of 25 (12 …,True,P663nvwAAAAJ:9jvjDF91bz4C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4698931018683680106&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

Compared to the rest. muscle blood flow can increase over 20-fold during intense exercise. Positron emission tomography (PET) and [15O]-H2O tracer provide a unique tool for the direct measurement of muscle blood flow in specific muscle regions. Quantification of PET blood flow requires knowledge of the arterial input function. which is usually provided by arterial blood sampling. However. arterial sampling is an invasive approach requiring arterial cannulation. In the current study. we aimed to explore the analysis and error estimation based on non-invasive. PET image-based input function for skeletal muscle blood flow in PET [15O]-labeled radiowater study.Methods Thirty healthy untrained men volunteered to participate in this study.[15O]-labeled radio water PET perfusion scans were performed at rest and right after cycling exercise. GE Discovery PET-CT scanner was used for image acquisition. The 15O isotope was produced with a Cyclone 3 cyclotron (IBA Molecular. Belgium).

Texture analysis is a group of computational methods extracting information about the relationship between adjacent pixels or voxels. Texture analysis evaluates the inhomogeneity of regional interest (ROI) of FDG accumulation and aims to improve the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET. However. there has been no previous data to evaluate the efficacy of this approach for detecting CS. The aim of this study was to distinguish the CS lesions from physiological uptakes using the texture analysis in patients with CS and non-CS.Methods: Twenty-one CS patients (58.2±15.0 y)(CS group) and 53 patients (62.5±13.0 y) who underwent FDG PET/CT for...,True,P663nvwAAAAJ:H2XcuePHLsAC,0,https://academic.oup.com/ehjcimaging/article-abstract/18/suppl_1/i80/3806230,,,,https://academic.oup.com/ehjcimaging/article/18/suppl_1/i80/3806230,0

Appropriate quantification of the tissue radioactivity data allows inferences to be made about biochemical and physiological processes reflected in the distribution and kinetics of the labelled molecule in humans in vivo. In addition to its use in research1and clinical practice2. pet makes a significant contribution to pharmaceutical development3. However. the administration of radiotracers to human subjects exposes them to an additional source of ionising radiation. In order for research ethics committees and other regulatory bodies to be able to adequately review research protocols. and for potential research subjects to be able to make an informed decision about their participation. it is necessary to estimate the risk to the subject posed by that exposure. In addition. restrictions are typically placed on the doses which can be administered to subjects who are not anticipated to benefit personally from a scanning procedure. Therefore. estimates of the radiation dose and associated risk arising from the administration of a particular radiotracer are required. In this review. we summarise the published radiation dose estimates for carbon-11 labelled pet tracers. discuss radiation dosimetry in the context of the research applications of pet imaging. and relate the doses required to meet common research objectives to the most widely used guidelines.,True,P663nvwAAAAJ:41b8sTJFDYwC,0,https://research.vu.nl/files/85973958/complete%20dissertation.pdf#page=14,,,,https://research.vu.nl/files/85973958/complete%20dissertation.pdf#page=14,0

Dr. Tschakovsky importantly emphasises that exercise-evoked vasodilation cannot directly spread from the active quadriceps muscle group to the inactive hamstring muscles. This was not what we literally meant. and although according to our understanding ascending vasodilatation and its spread to inactive tissues could be contributing to some marginal extent. his concern in this regard was apparently mainly raised from our integration of our findings with those of Moore and colleagues (2). together suggesting that α-adrenergic-mediated sympathetic constraint is important for optimization of blood flow and oxygen extraction to the most metabolically active tissues of the limb.

Here. we addressed whether these favorable properties of melanocortins could reduce atherosclerotic plaque inflammation and improve vasoreactivity in atherosclerotic mice. Approach and Results—Low-density lipoprotein receptor–deficient mice expressing only apolipoprotein B100 were fed a high-fat diet for 8 or 16 weeks and treated with either vehicle or a stable melanocortin analog. melanotan II (MT-II. 0.3 mg/kg per day. 4 weeks).

MT-II had no effect on body weight or composition. or plasma cholesterol levels in atherosclerotic mice. Without attenuating atherosclerotic lesion size or lesional macrophage accumulation. MT-II treatment reduced fluorine-18–labeled fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the atherosclerotic plaques. Resident macrophages in the lesions of MT-II–treated mice were polarized toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Systemic inflammation was also attenuated by MT-II intervention as evidenced by decreased plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines. In terms of aortic vasoreactivity. MT-II–treated mice showed enhanced endothelium-dependent relaxations. as well as promotion of vascular sensitivity to nitric oxide–mediated vasodilation. which were markedly impaired in control mice after prolonged duration of diet exposure.

Dr Eugenio Picano (Pisa. Italy). said:‘Cardiologists today are the true contemporary radiologists. Cardiology accounts for 40% of patient radiology exposure and equals more than 50 chest X-rays per person per year’. He added:‘Unfortunately. radiation risks are not widely known to all cardiologists and patients and this creates a potential for unwanted damage that will appear as cancers. decades later. We need the entire cardiology community to be proactive in minimising the radiological friendly fire in our imaging labs’. The paper lists doses and risks of the most common cardiology examinations for the first time. CT. PCI. cardiac electrophysiology. and nuclear cardiology deliver a dose equivalent to 750 chest X-rays (with wide variation from 100 to 2000 chest X-rays) per procedure. PCI for dilation of coronary artery stenosis totals almost 1 million procedures per year in Europe. The additional lifetime risk of fatal and non-fatal cancer for one PCI ranges from 1 in 1000. to 1 in 100 for a healthy 50-year-old man.

26835,Hybrid SPECT/CT and PET/CT Imaging,2013,Juhani Knuuti,,,,95-109,Springer. New York. NY,Hybrid imaging is becoming popular in cardiac imaging and currently refers to combining CT imaging with nuclear imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission CT (SPECT). Hybrid imaging offers the ability to assess the anatomy of the heart and coronary arteries. as well as the functional evaluation. at rest and during stress. The clinical experience of cardiac hybrid imaging is rapidly increasing. and the clinical potential of this technique for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) and its severity has been recognized. However. the evidence is still limited. especially in specific subpopulations. It is likely that in the near future the primary clinical use of hybrid imaging is not only in the detection of CAD but also in other molecular imaging applications that are entering clinical work.,True,P663nvwAAAAJ:k6nH7jlkaTkC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-5551-6_3,,,,,0

In addition. although the users have been apparently positive in their comments. rigorous direct comparison of this software against the others would be needed to judge. which method or software is better than the other.We very much appreciate that the authors have earlier presented an algorithm for interpreting absolute flow and flow reserve data in clinical decision making. 1 Such integrative algorithms are necessary for trials of revascularization guided by absolute flow measurements.

In the present study we measured femoral bone blood flow and glucose uptake in young healthy subjects by positron emission tomography in three separate protocols. In six women. blood flow was measured in femoral bone at rest and during one leg intermittent isometric exercise with increasing exercise intensities. In nine men. blood flow in femur was determined at rest and during dynamic one leg exercise. and two other physiological perturbations: moderate systemic hypoxia (14 O (2)) at rest and during exercise. and during intra-femoral infusion of high-dose adenosine. Bone glucose uptake was measured at rest and during dynamic one leg exercise in five men. The results indicate that isometric exercise increased femoral bone blood flow from rest (1.8±0.6 ml/100g/min) to low intensity exercise (4.1±1.5 ml/100g/min. p= 0.01). but blood flow did not increase further with increasing intensity. Resting femoral bone blood flow in men was similar to that of women and dynamic one leg exercise increased it to 4.2±1.2 ml/100g/min. p< 0.001. Breathing of hypoxic air did not change femoral bone blood flow at rest or during exercise. but intra-arterial infusion of adenosine during resting conditions increased bone blood flow to 5.7±2.4 ml/100g/min. to the level of moderate intensity dynamic exercise. Dynamic one-leg exercise increased femoral bone glucose uptake 4.7-fold compared to resting contralateral leg.

Myocardial SPECT can detect. localize. and quantify the degree of ischemic myocardium. The result of a myocardial perfusion SPECT is related to the prognostic outcome of cardiac events (ie. myocardial infarction and death). Therefore. myocardial perfusion SPECT is used to guide treatment in patients with stable angina and after acute coronary syndrome. Myocardial perfusion SPECT is a mature technique. one of the most commonly used cardiac imaging techniques. and part of the international guidelines for treatment of patients with ischemic heart disease. 1-3 There are international guidelines on how to perform. 4 how to report. 5 and when to use6 myocardial perfusion SPECT. Myocardial positron emission tomography (PET) is a newer nuclear medicine imaging technique that has rapidly become routine in cancer patients. The use in cardiology is also increasing because PET has inherent advantages compared to SPECT (eg. better image resolution and the possibility for absolute quantification of blood flow). However. the limited availability of the technique and especially of the PET perfusion tracers and higher costs are influencing the choice of method. and SPECT has kept its role as the main workhorse for cardiac patients. pathophysiologyMyocardial ischemia is defined as a mismatch between the demand and supply of oxygen to the myocytes. and this is mainly dependent on an adequate myocardial perfusion in various physiologic conditions.

Calf muscle blood flow was measured in 8 young men by positron emission tomography at normothermia. during local heating. and during whole-body heat stress when the heat source (water perfused suit) was not covering the evaluated leg. Local heating increased intramuscular temperature from 33.4 ± 1.0 °C to 37.4 ± 0.8 °C but intestinal temperature remained unchanged; whereas intestinal temperature increased from 37 ± 0.2 °C to 38.2 ± 0.4 °C during whole-body heat stress. Local heating increased muscle blood flow from 1.4 ± 0.5 ml/100g/min to 2.3 ± 1.2 ml/100g/min. p = 0.05.

Kaufmann7,2011,Juhani Knuuti and Stephen Schroeder and Michael J Zellweger10,32,European Heart Journal,,1986-1993,,Cardiovascular events remain one of the most frequent causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The majority of cardiac events occur in individuals without known coronary artery disease (CAD) and in low-to intermediate-risk subjects. Thus. the development of improved preventive strategies may substantially benefit from the identification. among apparently intermediate-risk subjects. of those who have a high probability for developing future cardiac events. Cardiac computed tomography and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) by single photon emission computed tomography may play a role in this setting. In fact. absence of coronary calcium in cardiac computed tomography and inducible ischaemia in MPS are associated with a very low rate of major cardiac events in the next 3–5 years. Based on current evidence. the evaluation of coronary calcium in primary prevention subjects should be considered in patients classified as intermediate-risk based on traditional risk factors. since high calcium scores identify subjects at high-risk who may benefit from aggressive secondary prevention strategies. In addition. calcium scoring should be considered for asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients without known CAD to select those in whom further functional testing by MPS or other stress imaging techniques may be considered to identify patients with significant inducible ischaemia. From available data. the use of MPS as first line testing modality for risk stratification is not recommended in any category of primary prevention subjects with the possible exception of first-degree relatives of patients with premature CAD in whom MPS may be …,True,P663nvwAAAAJ:5kvG9DmRKWYC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juhani_Knuuti2/publication/45188124_Cardiac_computed_tomography_and_myocardial_perfusion_scintigraphy_for_risk_stratification_in_asymptomatic_individuals_without_known_cardiovascular_disease_A_position_statement_of_the_Working_Group_on_/links/02bfe512f0b716ddae000000.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juhani_Knuuti2/publication/45188124_Cardiac_computed_tomography_and_myocardial_perfusion_scintigraphy_for_risk_stratification_in_asymptomatic_individuals_without_known_cardiovascular_disease_A_position_statement_of_the_Working_Group_on_/links/02bfe512f0b716ddae000000.pdf,0

Animal studies have also elucidated that it is also important to deliver blood only to those muscles engaged in exercise. but the distribution of blood flow between active and inactive muscles is little studied in humans. METHODS: We addressed the issue in the present study by investigating inactive muscle blood flow in six healthy young women during isolated intermittent isometric one leg knee extension exercise with increasing intensities (1-s contraction-2-s pause interval with 50. 100 and 15 Newton for ten minutes). Blood flow was measured by positron emission tomography from posterior hamstring muscles of the exercising leg. and whole thigh muscles and specifically from its knee extensors and posterior hamstring muscles of the resting leg.
