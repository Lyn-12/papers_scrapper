1051781,Eeyarestatin I inhibits Sec61-mediated protein translocation at the endoplasmic reticulum,2009,Benedict CS Cross and Craig McKibbin and Anna C Callan and Peristera Roboti and Michela Piacenti and Catherine Rabu and Cornelia M Wilson and Roger Whitehead and Sabine L Flitsch and Martin R Pool and Stephen High and Eileithyia Swanton,122,Journal of cell science,23,4393-4400,The Company of Biologists Ltd,Production and trafficking of proteins entering the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells is coordinated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a process that begins with protein translocation via the membrane-embedded ER translocon. The same complex is also responsible for the co-translational integration of membrane proteins and orchestrates polypeptide modifications that are often essential for protein function. We now show that the previously identified inhibitor of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) eeyarestatin 1 (ESI) is a potent inhibitor of protein translocation. We have characterised this inhibition of ER translocation both in vivo and in vitro. and provide evidence that ESI targets a component of the Sec61 complex that forms the membrane pore of the ER translocon. Further analyses show that ESI acts by preventing the transfer of the nascent polypeptide from the co-translational targeting machinery to the …,True,1URWSnEAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,94,https://jcs.biologists.org/content/122/23/4393.short,16426493377449883691,/scholar?cites=16426493377449883691,,https://jcs.biologists.org/content/joces/122/23/4393.full.pdf,0,0,0

This study examined 90 garden soils from Western Australia to evaluate predictions of antibiotic resistance genes from total metal conditions by comparing the concentrations of 12 metals and 13 genes related to tetracycline. beta-lactam and sulphonamide resistance. Relationships existed between metals and genes. but trends varied. All metals. except Se and Co. were related to at least one AR gene in terms of absolute gene numbers. but only Al.

Previous studies have described torsinA as a type II protein with a cleavable signal sequence. a single membrane spanning domain. and its C-terminus located in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) lumen. However. in the present study we show that torsinA is not in fact an integral membrane protein. Instead we find that the mature protein associates peripherally with the ER membrane. most likely through an interaction with an integral membrane protein. Consistent with this model. we provide evidence that the signal peptidase complex cleaves the signal sequence of torsinA. and we show that the region previously suggested to form a transmembrane domain is translocated into the lumen of the ER.

Greater than expected fetal growth has been positively associated with the risk of the development of some cancers in childhood. particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia. and the biological mechanisms underlying such associations are thought to involve insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). Circulating IGF levels are highly correlated with fetal growth. and IGFs are believed to play an important role in carcinogenesis; however. these two bodies of evidence have not been well integrated and. as a result. the potential underlying biological mechanisms linking the IGF system with the development of specific childhood cancers have not been elucidated.

In the work presented here. we studied mitotic cell death by making use of a UV-inactivated parvovirus (adeno-associated virus; AAV) that has been shown to induce a DNA damage response and subsequent death of p53-defective cells in mitosis. without affecting the integrity of the host genome. Osteosarcoma cells (U2OSp53DD) that are deficient in p53 and lack the G1 cell cycle checkpoint respond to AAV infection through a transient G2 arrest. We found that the infected U2OSp53DD cells died through mitotic catastrophe with no signs of chromosome condensation or DNA fragmentation. Moreover. cell death was independent of caspases. apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). autophagy and necroptosis. These findings were confirmed by time-lapse microscopy of cellular morphology following AAV infection. The assays used readily revealed apoptosis in other cell types when it was indeed occurring. Taken together the results indicate that in the absence of the G1 checkpoint. mitotic catastrophe occurs in these p53-null cells predominantly as a result of mechanical disruption induced by centrosome overduplication. and not as a consequence of a suicide signal.,True,EBCwo1IAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,59,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022946,11586825776902869502,/scholar?cites=11586825776902869502,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022946,0,0,0

The factors involved have been partially identified and are poorly characterised. Here. using Xenopus laevis egg extracts we show that RNAs are required for proper nuclear envelope assembly following sperm DNA decondensation. Although chromatin remodelling and pre-replication complex formation occur normally. RNA-depleted extracts show a defect in pre-RC activation. The nuclear processes affected by RNA-depletion included ELYS recruitment. which accounts for the deficiency in nuclear pore complex assembly. This results in failure in chromatin relaxation as well as in the import and proper nuclear concentration of the S-phase kinases necessary for DNA replication activation.

LLC,Dicer. an endoribonuclease best-known for its role in microRNA biogenesis and RNA interference pathway. has been shown to play a role in the DNA damage response and repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. However. it remains unknown whether Dicer is also important to preserve genome integrity upon replication stress. To address this question. we focused our study on common fragile sites (CFSs). which are susceptible to breakage after replication stress. We show that inhibition of the Dicer pathway leads to an increase in CFS expression upon induction of replication stress and to an accumulation of 53BP1 nuclear bodies. indicating transmission of replication-associated damage. We also show that in absence of a functional Dicer or Drosha. the assembly into nuclear foci of the Fanconi anemia (FA) protein FANCD2 and of the replication and checkpoint factor TopBP1 in …,True,EBCwo1IAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6633883/,4771917078497038752,/scholar?cites=4771917078497038752,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6633883/,0,0,0

This permits the Cre-mediated and -directed excision of the entire bacterial vector sequences from plasmid constructs to create supercoiled gene expression minicircles for gene therapy. Minicircle yields using standard culture volumes are sufficient for most in vitro and in vivo applications whereas minicircle expression in vitro is significantly increased over standard plasmid transfection.

To effectively address the problem. we introduce a strategy for constructing cancer cell nuclear-targeted copper sulfide nanoparticles (NPs) with a significant photothermal effect to completely kill residual cancer cells and prevent local cancer recurrence. The NPs could directly target the tumor cells and further enter the nucleus by the surface modification of RGD and TAT peptides. Under the irradiation of 980 nm near-infrared laser. the NPs rapidly increase the temperature of the nucleus. destroy the genetic substances. and ultimately lead to an exhaustive apoptosis of the cancer cells.

In this study. we synthesized the stable. water-soluble receptor 1a as a structural mimic of the active site in UDG. Compound 1a contains a 2.6-bis(glycylamino)pyridine group. which mimics the amino acid residues of UDG that interact with uracil through a hydrogen-bonding network; it also possesses a pyrene moiety as a π−π stacking interaction element and fluorescent probe that mimics the aromatic groups (phenyl and fluorescent indolyl units) found in the active site of UDG. Receptor 1a binds selectively to uracil and derivatives (including thymine. 5-formyluracil. 5-fluorouracil. and 5-nitrouracil) and some DNA and RNA nucleosides (including thymidine and …,True,chCPtYgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,22,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo901862x,18001997795936552271,/scholar?cites=18001997795936552271,,,0,0,0

The principal photoreceptor of the fly circadian clock. Drosophila cryptochrome (dCRY). contains a C-terminal tail (CTT) helix that binds beside a FAD cofactor and is essential for light signaling. Light reduces the dCRY FAD to an anionic semiquinone (ASQ) radical and increases CTT proteolytic susceptibility but does not lead to CTT chemical modification. Additional changes in proteolytic sensitivity and small-angle X-ray scattering define a conformational response of the protein to light that centers at the CTT but also involves regions remote from the flavin center.

With ectodomains of only ∼20–40 residues. it is unclear how such diminutive viral fusion proteins mediate the initial stages (i.e. membrane contact and close membrane apposition) of the fusion reaction that precede actual membrane merger. We now show that the FAST proteins lack specific receptor-binding activity. and in their natural biological context of promoting cell–cell fusion. rely on cadherins to promote close membrane apposition. The FAST proteins. however. are not specifically reliant on cadherin engagement to mediate membrane apposition as indicated by their ability to efficiently utilize other adhesins in the fusion reaction. Results further indicate that surrogate adhesion proteins that bridge membranes as close as 13 nm apart enhance FAST protein-induced cell–cell fusion. but active actin remodelling is required for maximal fusion activity. The FAST proteins are the first example of membrane fusion proteins that have specifically evolved to function as opportunistic fusogens. designed to exploit and convert naturally occurring adhesion sites into fusion sites. The capacity of surrogate. non-cognate adhesins and active actin remodelling to enhance the cell–cell fusion activity of the FAST proteins are features perfectly suited to the structural and functional evolution of these fusogens as the minimal fusion component of a virus-encoded cellular fusion machine.

In contrast to other hematophagous insects. the triatomine gut is compartmentalized into three segments that perform different functions during blood digestion. Here we report analysis of transcriptomes for each of the segments using pyrosequencing technology. Comparison of transcript frequency in digestive libraries with a whole-body library was used to evaluate expression levels. All classes of digestive enzymes were highly expressed. with a predominance of cysteine and aspartic proteinases. the latter showing a significant expansion through gene duplication. Although no protein digestion is known to occur in the anterior midgut (AM). protease transcripts were found. suggesting secretion as pro-enzymes. being possibly activated in the posterior midgut (PM).

The expression of 9-O-acetyl gangliosides recognized by the JONES mAb correlates with periods of cell migration and axonal pathfinding.

In this study we have investigated the effect of JONES mAb addition on the cytoskeleton of dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro. We have shown that blockage of 9-O-acetyl gangliosides induces the appearance of lateral spikes along the neurites in addition to the effect on the growth cone. Microfilament and microtubular rearrangements accompany these structural modifications. We present evidence that the main effect of JONES mAb is to induce microtubule depolymerization both in growth cones and neurites.

The pathway is centered on PIWI clade Argonaute proteins and the associated small non-coding RNAs termed piRNAs. In this study. we set to investigate the evolutionary conservation of the piRNA pathway in the hemimetabolous insect Rhodnius prolixus. Our transcriptome profiling reveals that core components of the pathway are expressed during previtellogenic stages of oogenesis. Rhodnius’ genome harbors four putative piwi orthologs. We show that Rp-piwi2. Rp-piwi3 and Rp-ago3. but not Rp-piwi1 transcripts are produced in the germline tissues and maternally deposited in the mature eggs. Consistent with a role in Rhodnius oogenesis. parental RNAi against the Rp-piwi2. Rp-piwi3 and Rp-ago3 results in severe egg laying and female adult fertility defects. Furthermore. we show that the reduction of the Rp-piwi2 levels by parental RNAi disrupts oogenesis by causing a dramatic loss of trophocytes. egg chamber degeneration and oogenesis arrest. Intriguingly. the putative Rp-Piwi2 protein features a polyglutamine tract at its N-terminal region. which is conserved in PIWI proteins encoded in the genome of other Triatomine species. Together with R. prolixus. these hematophagous insects are primary vectors of the Chagas disease.

Accumulation of AGEs in the body is implicated in various pathophysiological conditions like diabetes. cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis. Numerous studies have reported the connecting link between AGEs and the various complications associated with diseases. Hence. detection and measurement of AGEs becomes centrally important to understand and manage the menace created by AGEs inside the body. In recent years. an increasing number of immunotechniques as well as bioanalytical techniques have been developed to efficiently measure the levels of AGEs. but most of them are still far away from being clinically consistent. as relative disparity and ambiguity masks their standardization.

Proteins are susceptible to ROS modifications of amino acid side chains which alter protein structure. Among the amino acids. Cysteine (Cys) is more prone to oxidation by ROS because of its high nucleophilic property. The reactivity of Cys with ROS is due to the presence of thiol group. In the oxidised form. Cys forms disulfide bond. which are primary covalent cross-link found in proteins. and which stabilize the native conformation of a protein. Indirect evidence suggests that thiol modifications by ROS may be involved in neurodegenerative disorders. but the significance and precise extent of the contributions are poorly understood.

Whereas no extensive studies have been carried out to assess the role of EGPs in secondary complications of diabetes. numerous investigators have demonstrated the role of AGEs. Early glycation involves attachment of glucose on ε-NH2 of lysine residues of proteins leading to generation of the Amadori product (an early glycation species). This study reports the structural and immunological characterization of EGPs of HSA because we believe that during persistent hyperglycemia the HSA. one of the major blood proteins. can undergo fast glycation.

The aim of this study is to investigate the promoter methylation. loss of expression and significance of PTEN gene in breast cancer and to determine the correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression.Methods: Promoter methylation and loss of expression of PTEN gene were analyzed using methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemical methods respectively. The chi square test is used to correlate the promoter methylation and gene expression with their clincopathologic parameters.Results: We examined 53 breast cancer specimens and 10 normal tissues adjacent to tumor. The results showed a 58.5% promoter methylation in PTEN gene and none in normal tissue. PTEN methylation was observed in advanced stages III-IV (81.8%. 18 of 22. P= 0.015) and higher grades G2-G3 (71.4%. 20 of 28. P= 0.043) of disease. The correlation of PTEN methylation with clinical stage and tumor grade was found to be statistically significant. Nuclear PTEN expression was detected in 73.6%(39 of 53) cases of breast cancer and in the remaining 26.4%(14 of 53) cases expressional loss was observed. The loss of PTEN expression was observed in all normal tissues (10 of 10). The loss of PTEN expression was significantly correlated with patient’s age (P= 0.028) and clinical stage (P= 0.029).

F,,300-306,,Leishmania arginase is a potential drug target for the treatment of leishmaniasis because this binuclear manganese metalloenzyme initiates de novo polyamine biosynthesis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of l-arginine to generate l-ornithine and urea. The product l-ornithine subsequently undergoes decarboxylation to yield putrescine. which in turn is utilized for spermidine biosynthesis. Polyamines such as spermidine are essential for the growth and survival of the parasite. so inhibition of enzymes in the polyamine-biosynthetic pathway comprises an effective strategy for treating parasitic infections. To this end. two X-ray crystal structures of L. mexicana arginase complexed with α.α-disubstituted boronic amino-acid inhibitors based on the molecular scaffold of 2-(S)-amino-6-boronohexanoic acid are now reported.

Importantly. this “background” level of receptor phosphorylation is insufficient to effect a downstream response. suggesting that strict controls are present and prohibit full activation. Here a mechanism is described in which control of FGFR2 activation is provided by the adaptor protein Grb2. Dimeric Grb2 binds to the C termini of two FGFR2 molecules. This heterotetramer is capable of a low-level receptor transphosphorylation. but C-terminal phosphorylation and recruitment of signaling proteins are sterically hindered. Upon stimulation.

Reduction of Grb2 concentration permits Plcγ1 access to the receptor. Recruitment of Plcγ1 in this way is sufficient to upregulate phospholipase activity. This results in elevated phosphatidylinositol 4. 5-bisphosphate turnover and intracellular calcium levels. thus leading to increased cell motility and promotion of cell-invasive behavior in the absence of extracellular receptor stimulation.

1052294,Interaction with Shc prevents aberrant Erk activation in the absence of extracellular stimuli,2013,Kin Man Suen and Chi-Chuan Lin and Roger George and Fernando A Melo and Eleanor R Biggs and Zamal Ahmed and Melanie N Drake and Swathi Arur and Stefan T Arold and John E Ladbury,20,Nature structural & molecular biology,5,620,Nature Publishing Group,Control mechanisms that prevent aberrant signaling are necessary to maintain cellular homeostasis. We describe a new mechanism by which the adaptor protein Shc directly binds the MAP kinase Erk. thus preventing its activation in the absence of extracellular stimuli. The Shc–Erk complex restricts Erk nuclear translocation. restraining Erk-dependent transcription of genes. including those responsible for oncogenic growth. The complex forms through unique binding sites on both the Shc PTB domain and the N-terminal lobe of Erk. Upon receptor tyrosine kinase stimulation. a conformational change within Shc—induced through interaction with the phosphorylated receptor—releases Erk. allowing it to fulfill its role in signaling. Thus. in addition to its established role in promoting MAP kinase signaling in stimulated cells. Shc negatively regulates Erk activation in the absence of growth factors and thus could be …,True,VRb-dOoAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,21,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb.2557.pdf?origin=ppub,10958681432976131051,/scholar?cites=10958681432976131051,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4059177/,0,0,0

LOR condenses lysine and 2-oxoglutarate into saccharopine. using NADPH as cofactor and SDH converts saccharopine into α-aminoadipate δ-semialdehyde and glutamic acid. using NAD as cofactor. The distribution pattern of LOR and SDH among different tissues of Phaseolus vulgaris was determined. The hypocotyl contained the highest specific activity. whereas in seeds the activities of LOR and SDH were below the limit of detection. Precipitation of hypocotyl proteins with increasing concentrations of PEG 8000 revealed one broad peak of SDH activity. indicating that two isoforms may be present. a bifunctional LOR-SDH and possibly a monofunctional SDH.

Além disso. a lisina é o principal aminoácido limitante em todos os cereais e por cerca de 30 anos a via do ácido aspártico tem sido estudada em plantas. com o intuito de desvendar e caracterizar os principais pontos chave na regulação das vias de biossíntese desses aminoácidos. Duas etapas distintas. uma primeira originada a partir do desenvolvimento da cultura de tecidos (anos 70-80) e a segunda a partir do desenvolvimento de técnicas para a transformação de plantas (anos 90). permitiram que mutantes bioquímicos e plantas trangênicas fossem produzidos com alterações específicas em passos metabólicos chave. levando à superprodução e acúmulo de treonina em vários tecidos das plantas. Entretanto. a acumulação de lisina em sementes não foi obtida. Tal fato. associado a estudos bioquímicos da via de degradação da lisina em cereais e em leguminosas. indicou que a manipulação da degradação seria tão ou mais importante que a manipulação da biossíntese de lisina para o acúmulo deste aminoácido em sementes dos cereais .

The catabolism of lysine is performed by the action of two consecutive enzymes. lysine 2-oxoglutarate reductase (LOR. EC 1.5.1.8) and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH. EC 1.5.1.9). The final soluble lysine concentration in cereal seeds is controlled by both synthesis and catabolism rates. The production and characterization of high-lysine plants species depends on knowledge of the regulatory aspects of lysine metabolism and manipulation of the key enzymes. We have for the first time isolated. partially purified. and characterized LOR and SDH from developing sorghum seeds. which exhibited low levels of activity.

Changing proline content in drought-stressed bean plants,2018,Marcia Eugenia Amaral Carvalho and Paulo Roberto de Camargo and Salete A Gaziola and Ricardo Antunes Azevedo,9,Comunicata Scientiae,2,292-297,UFPI-Universidade Federal do Piauí,Abiotic stresses negatively affect crop development and yield. However. the use of seaweed extracts can alleviate production losses through improvement of the antioxidant system and synthesis of compatible osmolytes. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of Ascophyllum nodosum extract on antioxidant response and yield of common bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) under drought stress. Therefore. two methods of application (foliar spray and soil irrigation) and two doses (5 and 10 mL L-1) were tested. whereas untreated plants were used as control. There were no significant differences in malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide contents among treatments. indicating that application of seaweed extract did not change the oxidative status in treated plants when compared to the control ones. On the other hand. the use of seaweed extract increased proline content even prior to drought stress (46.3 to 145.4% when compared to the control). and this increment remained until the 10th day of stress (from 60.1 to 201.7% over the reference plants). supporting early evidences that A. nodosum extract is a plant elicitor. The yield parameters were not affected by the extract. probably due to the severe drought stress which plants were submitted. The results suggest that A. nodosum extract affects proline metabolism in Phaseolus vulgaris plants. making the synthesis of this osmolyte more responsive to drought stress because seaweed-treated plants presented a higher proline content than the control ones during the exposure to water deficit.,True,OpmdU58AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,14,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6522476,560499150027956272,/scholar?cites=560499150027956272,,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/6522476.pdf,0,0,0

This study evaluated Cd effects on the enzymatic activities of lysine (Lys) metabolism. storage protein and amino acid profile in maize. Stress parameters were also assessed. In vegetative organs. Cd was accumulated in the following decreasing order: roots > stems > leaves. Cadmium accumulation in grains decreased at grain maturity (from 0.25 to 0.07 µg g−1 DW). In leaves. neither hydrogen peroxide content nor superoxide dismutase. catalase. ascorbate peroxide and guaiacol peroxidase activities did not change in Cd-treated plants compared to control plants. Lipid peroxidation was not detected in immature grains and leaves of plants under Cd exposure. indicating that Cd accumulation mainly in the roots is a mechanism to avoid oxidative stress in aboveground parts of the plant. However. Lys metabolism in immature grains was modified. showing increases in the specific activities of aspartate kinase (AK) and dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) after Cd exposure. AK sensitivity to Lys feedback inhibition increased. but decreased in DHDPS in Cd-treated plants. suggesting differential regulation for these enzymes. In mature grains. the Lys content did not change. while the proline content increased by 54 % in Cd-treated plants.

1052407,Implantation in the baboon: endometrial responses,1999,AT Fazleabas and JJ Kim and S Srinivasan and KM Donnelly and A Brudney and RC Jaffe,17,,03,257-265,Copyright© 1999 by Thieme Medical Publishers. Inc.,Blastocyst implantation in the baboon usually occurs between 8 and 10 days post ovulation. Changes that occur within this window of receptivity and immediately following implantation can be divided into three distinct phases. The first phase. regulated by estrogen and progesterone. is characterized primarily by changes in both the luminal and glandular epithelial cells in preparation for blastocyst apposition and attachment. The second phase is the further modulation of these steroid induced changes in both epithelial and stromal cells by embryonic signals.

These animals have a point mutation in carboxypeptidase E (CPE). an exopeptidase that removes C-terminal basic amino acids from peptide intermediates. The mutation renders the enzyme unstable. and it is rapidly degraded. Although the infertility of Cpefat/fat mice has not been systematically investigated. it is thought to be due to a deficit in GnRH processing. We have evaluated this hypothesis and found hypothalamic GnRH levels to be reduced by 65–78% and concentrations of pro-GnRH and C-terminal-extended intermediates to be high. Basal serum gonadotropin contents are similar among wild-type. heterozygous. and homozygous mice. Testis morphology and function are abnormal in older obese Cpefat/fat mice. Matings between homozygous mutants yield a 5% pregnancy rate.

1052413,Pro-GnRH processing,2002,William C Wetsel and Sudha Srinivasan,141,,,221-241,Elsevier,An inspection of the deduced amino acid sequences from the nine complementary pro-GnRH forms demonstrates several points. All pro-gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) proteins contain GnRH at their N-termini and the peptide is separated by a putative processing site from GnRH-associated peptide (GAP). The organization and spatial arrangement of these sequences suggest that the enzymes that process the pro-GnRH in a given cell are similar across all species. In addition. excision of the GnRH peptide from the precursor is performed by an endopeptidase. Because most peptide precursors appear to be processed at monobasic or dibasic residues. the endopeptidase could cleave the pro-GnRH after the Lys or Arg residues. The regulation of peptide bioactivity is a complex process.

SMAD4. and Hereditary Hemorrhagic,2016,SUDHA SRINIVASAN and JONATHAN N BERG and DOUGLASA MARCHUK,,Epstein's Inborn Errors of Development: The Molecular Basis of Clinical Disorders of Morphogenesis,,393,Oxford University Press,Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) was first described over a 100 years ago. but an understanding of its molecular basis began only with the identification of genes mutated in this disorder (1984 to 2004). Loss-of-function mutations in ENDOGLIN (ENG). the first identified HHT gene (chromosome 9q33-q34). cause HHT type 1 (or HHT1). HHT1 families show a higher incidence of pulmonary involvement than other HHT families. HHT caused by loss-of-function mutations in ACTIVIN RECEPTOR–LIKE KINASE 1 (ACVRL1 or ALK1. which is used in the following text)(chromosome 12q13) has been termed HHT type 2 (or HHT2). These families exhibit a higher incidence of liver involvement and later onset of symptoms. In a third type of HHT. called juvenile polyposis (JP) HHT. all affected individuals have JP along with an inherited predisposition to malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract in addition to having HHT. SMAD4 is the gene mutated in JP-HHT and maps to chromosome 18q21. All 3 causative genes identified so far are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway. indicating that HHT occurs because of dysregulated signaling through this pathway. There is evidence for a fourth locus on chromosome 5q. but the mutated gene at this locus is yet to be identified (Cole et al.. 2005).Mutations in ENG and ALK1 genes are. for the most part. familyspecific. Numerous mutations have been described in both genes that are predicted to abrogate their function and in many cases make no protein product at all.

APC/C is activated by Cdc20 and inhibited by the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). which delays mitotic exit when the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is activated. We previously identified apcin as a small molecule ligand of Cdc20 that inhibits APC/C Cdc20 and prolongs mitosis. Here we find that apcin paradoxically shortens mitosis when SAC activity is high. These opposing effects of apcin arise from targeting of a common binding site in Cdc20 required for both substrate ubiquitination and MCC-dependent APC/C inhibition.

Using this assay system. we found that fusion between single GUVs and BV envelopes was significantly enhanced at around pH 5.0–6.0. which suggests that: (1) envelope glycoprotein GP64-mediated membrane fusion within the endosome of insect cells was reproduced in our artificial system; (2) acidic phospholipids in GUVs are necessary for this fusion. which are in agreement with the previous results with conventional small liposomes including large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles; and (3) the efficiency of fusion …,True,UlouN1gAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,32,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273610001604,6370115416577820670,/scholar?cites=6370115416577820670,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273610001604,0,0,0

Challenges remain with respect to the development of such systems. including label-free output detection and the rapidity of operation. Here. we propose integration of biological nanopores with DNA molecules for development of a logical operating system. We configured outputs “1” and “0” as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is or is not translocated through a nanopore; unlabeled DNA was detected electrically. A negative-AND (NAND) operation was successfully conducted within approximately 10 min. which is rapid compared with previous studies using unlabeled DNA. In addition. this operation was executed in a four-droplet network. DNA molecules and associated information were transferred among droplets via biological nanopores. This system would facilitate linking of molecules and electronic interfaces.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Connexin‐43 (Cx43) containing giant liposomes (GL) were prepared by a baculovirus expression–liposome fusion method. Recombinant budded viruses expressing Cx43 were prepared and then fused with GLs containing DOPG/DOPC at pH 4.5. Connexon formation on the GL membrane was observed by transmission electron microscope. Hydrophilic fluorescent dye transfers were observed through a Cx43‐mediated pathway not only between Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells with Cx43 but also from giant Cx43 liposomes to Cx43‐expressing U2OS cells (human osteosarcoma cell). The functional connexin‐containing liposome is expected to be useful for cellular cytosolic delivery systems. The original orientation and function of Cx43 was maintained after integration into the liposomes.
