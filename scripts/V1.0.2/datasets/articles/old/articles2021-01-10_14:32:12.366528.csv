Genotyping analysis of ADRB2 gene (rs1042713. rs1042714. rs1042717. rs1042718. and rs1042719) was performed on 137 patients with preterm labor. Survival analysis was conducted for the effects of SNPs on the median time to delivery as a primary outcome. The median time to delivery in the study patients was 349.3 h. Gestational age at admission and modified Bishop scores revealed significant effects on time to delivery (p< 0.001). Among studied SNPs. rs1042717 and rs1042718 showed linkage disequilibrium in this population. and their effects on time to delivery were marginally significant (p< 0.1). Patients with variant-homozygotes in the rs1042713 showed considerably shortened time to delivery compared to wild-allele carriers. The rs1042719 polymorphism significantly affected time to delivery in both univariate and multivariate analysis; the GC and CC carriers showed 64% decrease in time to delivery compared to the wild-type homozygote carriers. Based on the results. it was concluded that the gene polymorphisms of ADRB2 could affect ritodrine therapy in patients with preterm labor. However. given the single-center and the relatively small sample size. our hypothesis requires further independent validation using multi-center and large sample size.

31542,Convolutional nets for reconstructing neural circuits from brain images acquired by serial section electron microscopy,2019,Kisuk Lee and Nicholas Turner and Thomas Macrina and Jingpeng Wu and Ran Lu and H Sebastian Seung,55,,,188-198,Elsevier Current Trends,Neural circuits can be reconstructed from brain images acquired by serial section electron microscopy. Image analysis has been performed by manual labor for half a century. and efforts at automation date back almost as far. Convolutional nets were first applied to neuronal boundary detection a dozen years ago. and have now achieved impressive accuracy on clean images. Robust handling of image defects is a major outstanding challenge. Convolutional nets are also being employed for other tasks in neural circuit reconstruction: finding synapses and identifying synaptic partners. extending or pruning neuronal reconstructions. and aligning serial section images to create a 3D image stack. Computational systems are being engineered to handle petavoxel images of cubic millimeter brain volumes.,True,srzZIhcAAAAJ:H1FpnsQ9v50C,14,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438818301788,4215442349418989280,/scholar?cites=4215442349418989280,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12966,0

It is not known whether the brain-dissection process and its duration also alter these metabolites. We applied CO2 with or without head-focused microwave fixation for 2 min to evaluate the effects of CO2-induced asphyxiation. dissection. and dissection time on brain oxylipin concentrations. Compared with head-focused microwave fixation (control). CO2 followed by microwave fixation prior to dissection increased oxylipins derived from lipoxygenase (LOX). 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH). cytochrome P450 (CYP). and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzymatic pathways. This effect was enhanced when the duration of postmortem ischemia was prolonged by 6.4 min prior to microwave fixation.

Agonists that show higher potency to specific signaling pathways over others are known as “biased agonists” and have been shown to have better therapeutic index. Although biased agonists are desirable. their design poses several challenges to date. The number of assays to identify biased agonists seems expensive and tedious. Therefore. computational methods that can reliably calculate the possible bias of various ligands ahead of experiments and provide guidance. will be both cost and time effective. In this work. using the mechanism of allosteric communication from the extracellular region to the intracellular transducer protein coupling region in GPCRs. we have developed a computational method to calculate ligand bias ahead of …,True,srzZIhcAAAAJ:CaJTFBI5vqAC,14,http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/93/4/288?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Mol_Pharmacol_TrendMD_1,6956005485799336802,/scholar?cites=6956005485799336802,,http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/93/4/288.full,0
31545,Gypenosides ameliorate memory deficits in MPTP-lesioned mouse model of Parkinson’s disease treated with L-DOPA,2017,Ting Ting Zhao and Kyung Sook Kim and Keon Sung Shin and Hyun Jin Park and Hyun Jeong Kim and Kyung Eun Lee and Myung Koo Lee,17,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,1,1-9,BioMed Central,Previous studies have revealed that gypenosides (GPS) improve the symptoms of anxiety disorders in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1.2.3.6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned rat model of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The present study aimed to investigate the effects of GPS on memory deficits in an MPTP-lesioned mouse model of PD treated with L-3.4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). MPTP (30 mg/kg/day. 5 days)-lesioned mice were treated with GPS (50 mg/kg) and/or L-DOPA (10 and 25 mg/kg) for 21 days. After the final treatments. behavioral changes were assessed in all mice using passive avoidance and elevated plus-maze tests. We then evaluated the biochemical influences of GPS treatment on levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). dopamine. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). and cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. MPTP-lesioned mice exhibited deficits associated with habit learning and spatial memory. which were further aggravated by treatment with L-DOPA (25 mg/kg). However. treatment with GPS (50 mg/kg) ameliorated memory deficits. Treatment with GPS (50 mg/kg) also improved L-DOPA (25 mg/kg)-treated MPTP lesion-induced decreases in retention latency on the passive avoidance test. as well as levels of TH-immunopositive cells and dopamine in the substantia nigra and striatum. GPS treatment also attenuated increases in retention transfer latency on the elevated plus-maze test and in NMDA receptor expression. as well as decreases in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and CREB in the hippocampus.
