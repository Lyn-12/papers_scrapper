119556,A novel CDK9-associated C-type cyclin interacts directly with HIV-1 Tat and mediates its high-affinity. loop-specific binding to TAR RNA,1998,Ping Wei and Mitchell E Garber and Shi-Min Fang and Wolfgang H Fischer and Katherine A Jones,92,Cell,4,451-462,Cell Press,The HIV-1 Tat protein regulates transcription elongation through binding to the viral TAR RNA stem-loop structure. We have isolated a novel 87 kDa cyclin C–related protein (cyclin T) that interacts specifically with the transactivation domain of Tat. Cyclin T is a partner for CDK9. an RNAPII transcription elongation factor. Remarkably. the interaction of Tat with cyclin T strongly enhances the affinity and specificity of the Tat:TAR RNA interaction. and confers a requirement for sequences in the loop of TAR that are not recognized by Tat alone. Moreover. overexpression of human cyclin T rescues Tat activity in nonpermissive rodent cells.

We previously reported that MAM interacts with CBP/p300 and promotes hyperphosphorylation and degradation of the Notch ICD in vivo. Here we show that CycC:CDK8 and CycT1:CDK9/P-TEFb are recruited with Notch and associated coactivators (MAM. SKIP) to the HES1 promoter in signaling cells. MAM interacts directly with CDK8 and can cause it to localize to subnuclear foci. Purified recombinant CycC:CDK8 phosphorylates the Notch ICD within the TAD and PEST domains. and expression of CycC:CDK8 strongly enhances Notch ICD hyperphosphorylation and PEST-dependent degradation by the Fbw7/Sel10 ubiquitin ligase in vivo.

The TCF-1 alpha cDNA contains a single 68-amino-acid domain that is homologous to a region conserved among high-mobility group (HMG) and nonhistone chromosomal proteins. Expression of full-length and mutant cDNA clones in bacteria reveal that the single HMG motif. which is predicted to contain two extended alpha-helical segments. is sufficient to direct the sequence-specific binding of TCF-1 alpha to DNA.

119568,A competition between stimulators and antagonists of Upf complex recruitment governs human nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,2008,Guramrit Singh and Indrani Rebbapragada and Jens Lykke-Andersen,6,PLoS Biol,4,e111,Public Library of Science,The nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway subjects mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs) to rapid decay. The conserved Upf1–3 complex interacts with the eukaryotic translation release factors. eRF3 and eRF1. and triggers NMD when translation termination takes place at a PTC. Contrasting models postulate central roles in PTC-recognition for the exon junction complex in mammals versus the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) in other eukaryotes. Here we present evidence for a unified model for NMD. in which PTC recognition in human cells is mediated by a competition between 3′ UTR–associated factors that stimulate or antagonize recruitment of the Upf complex to the terminating ribosome. We identify cytoplasmic PABP as a human NMD antagonizing factor. which inhibits the interaction between eRF3 and Upf1 in vitro and prevents NMD in cells when positioned in proximity to the termination codon. Surprisingly. only when an extended 3′ UTR places cytoplasmic PABP distally to the termination codon does a downstream exon junction complex enhance NMD. likely through increasing the affinity of Upf proteins for the 3′ UTR. Interestingly. while an artificial 3′ UTR of >420 nucleotides triggers NMD. a large subset of human mRNAs contain longer 3′ UTRs but evade NMD. We speculate that these have evolved to concentrate NMD-inhibiting factors. such as PABP. in spatial proximity of the termination codon.,True,nK3RdOIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,323,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060111,1778036309359966588,/scholar?cites=1778036309359966588,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060111,0,0,0

These proteins bind mRNAs in myriad ways with varying affinities and stoichiometries. with many assembling onto nascent RNAs in a highly ordered process during transcription and precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) processing.

A final posttranscriptional step in gene expression is the turnover of the mRNP. which involves degradation of the mRNA and recycling of associated proteins. How tightly associated protein components are released from degrading mRNPs is unknown. Here. we demonstrate that the ATPase activity of the RNA helicase Upf1 allows disassembly of mRNPs undergoing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In the absence of Upf1 ATPase activity. partially degraded NMD mRNA intermediates accumulate in complex with NMD factors and concentrate in processing bodies.

119580,Use of staphylococcal protein A as an immunological reagent,1978,James W Goding,20,,,241-253,Elsevier,This brief review summarises the major uses of staphylococcal protein A in immunology. Protein A is covalently linked to the cell wall of most strains of Staphylococcus aureus. and binds immunoglobulin molecules with high affinity. The principal molecule bound is IgG. although in many cases binding is restricted to certain IgG subclasses. Some IgM and IgA binds in certain species. This property allows rapid. simple and economical methods for the purification and analysis of immunoglobulins. and the fractionation of subclasses which are difficult to separate by other means. Fractionation on protein A affinity columns is a simple and effcient way of separating immunoglobulin F(ab) and F(ab')2 from Fc fragments. Intact staphylococci are useful as a solid phase adsorbent for isolating antigen—antibody complexes. membrane antigens and receptors. and to replace ‘second antibody’ in radioimmunoassay.

The two p65 subunits are not symmetrically disposed on the DNA target. The homodimer should optimally bind to a pseudo-palindromic nine base pair target with each subunit recognizing a 5′ GGAA-3′ half site separated by a central A–T base pair. However. one of the subunits (subunit B) encounters a half site of 5′-GAAA-3′.

Strawberries are common and important fruit due to their high content of essential nutrient and beneficial phytochemicals which seem to have relevant biological activity on human health. In the present study we investigated the antioxidant and protective effects of three strawberry extracts against ethanol-induced gastric mucosa damage in an experimental in vivo model and to test whether strawberry extracts affect antioxidant enzyme activities in gastric mucosa.   Methods/Principal Findings Strawberry extracts were obtained from Adria. Sveva and Alba cultivars. Total antioxidant capacity and radical scavenging capacity were performed by TEAC. ORAC and electron paramagnetic resonance assays. Identification and quantification of anthocyanins was carried out by HPLC-DAD-MS analyses. Different groups of animals received 40 mg/day/kg body weight of strawberry crude extracts for 10 days. Gastric damage was induced by ethanol. The ulcer index was calculated together with the determination of catalase and SOD activities and MDA contents. Strawberry extracts are rich in anthocyanins and present important antioxidant capacity. Ethanol caused severe gastric damage and strawberry consumption protected against its deleterious role. Antioxidant enzyme activities increased significantly after strawberry extract intake and a concomitantly decrease in gastric lipid peroxidation was found.

They are best known as inducible transcriptional regulators of genes encoding molecular chaperones and other stress proteins. Four members of the HSF family are also important for normal development and lifespan-enhancing pathways. and the repertoire of HSF targets has thus expanded well beyond the heat shock genes.

Hsps function as molecular chaperones in regulating cellular homeostasis and promoting survival. If the stress is too severe. a signal that leads to programmed cell death. apoptosis. is activated. thereby providing a finely tuned balance between survival and death. In addition to extracellular stimuli. several nonstressful conditions induce Hsps during normal cellular growth and development. The enhanced heat shock gene expression in response to various stimuli is regulated by heat shock transcription factors (HSFs).

A prominent feature of stressed cells is the increased synthesis of heat shock proteins (Hsps) that aid in the refolding of misfolded peptides and restrain protein aggregation. Transcriptional activation of the heat shock response is orchestrated by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). which rapidly translocates to hsp genes and induces their expression.

We investigated the splicing of the ED I exon. which encodes a facultative type III repeat of fibronectin. whose inclusion is regulated during development and in proliferative processes. We used an alternative splicing assay combined with promoter swapping to demonstrate that the extent of ED I splicing is dependent on the promoter structure from which the transcript originated and that this regulation is independent of the promoter strength. Thus. these results provide the first evidence for coupling between alternative splicing and promoter-specific transcription. which agrees with recent cytological and biochemical evidence of coordination between splicing and transcription.,True,Yw5AAEkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,425,https://www.pnas.org/content/94/21/11456.short,8772501063288891863,/scholar?cites=8772501063288891863,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/94/21/11456.full.pdf,0,0,0

By using a transient expression alternative splicing assay combined with promoter swapping. we have demonstrated that the promoter can also control EDI splicing. arguing for coupling between the transcription and splicing machineries. We now report that the SR proteins SF2/ASF and 9G8 stimulate EDI splicing in vivo and that their effect requires an intact EDI ESE.

We have conducted a series of in vitro experiments aimed at understanding the structural and functional features associated with this splicing enhancer (SE).

Deletion and replacement analysis identifies the stimulating sequences as a purine-rich stretch of 9 nucleotides (GAAGAAGAC). The SE element stimulates splicing to the ED1 3'splice site from various positions within the exon except when placed beyond 293 nucleotides downstream from that 3'splice site.

Due to its widespread industrial use. chromium (Cr) has become a serious pollutant in diverse environmental settings. The hexavalent form of the metal. Cr(VI). is considered a more toxic species than the relatively innocuous and less mobile Cr(III) form. The presence of Cr in the environment has selected microbial and plant variants able to tolerate high levels of Cr compounds. The diverse Cr-resistance mechanisms displayed by microorganisms. and probably by plants. include biosorption. diminished accumulation. precipitation. reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). and chromate efflux.

Consequently. these peptides are being considered as potential sources to control various oxidative processes in the human body as well as in food. It is however difficult to compare results from various studies due to the diversity of in vitro assay systems and inconsistency in the conditions used to evaluate antioxidative capacity of peptides and protein hydrolysates. Further. specific assays and biomarkers are yet to be established to confirm their bioactive potential. This review summarizes the literature on food sources and methods of antioxidative peptide production. and the reported efficacies and mechanisms of their action.

The average weight of eggs produced by selectively bred strains of hens is in the vicimty of 60 g (Chung and Stadelman. 1965; Cotterill and Geiger. 1977; Kline. Meehan. and Sugihara. 1965; Marion et al.. 1964). Shell eggs consist of about 9.5% dieU. 63% albumen. and 27.5% yoBc (Cotterill and Geiger. 1977). The total solids of albumen. yoUc. and whole egg are around 12%. 52%. and 24%. respectively. The shell shape and weight of hens’ eggs are dependent onheredity. age of the bird. season of the year. and diet. To meet high quality standards of market eggs. commercial flocks have been selected through extensive breeding programs and. in addition. the nutritional adequacy of the birds has been established. Most hens’ eggs destined for market have an oval shape. The shape of the egg can be expressed very roughly by the shape index (breadthdength x 100). According to Romanoff and Romanoff (1949). the standard egg of a hen had a shape index of 74 with blunt and pointed ends; shape index values ranging from 63.1 to 81.7. with a median value of 70. were observed for eggs from a flock of 262 Leghorn hens. Knowledge of the chemical conqiosition and physicochemical properties of native albumen and yolk should be useful for interpreting the changes that occur during shell egg storage and during pasteurizing. drying. and freezing.

In the absence of a known cause. this syndrome was named Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) because the main trait was a rapid loss of adult worker bees. We initiated a descriptive epizootiological study in order to better characterize CCD and compare risk factor exposure between populations afflicted by and not afflicted by CCD.  Methods and Principal Findings Of 61 quantified variables (including adult bee physiology. pathogen loads. and pesticide levels). no single measure emerged as a most-likely cause of CCD. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with a greater number of pathogens than control populations. suggesting either an increased exposure to pathogens or a reduced resistance of bees toward pathogens. Levels of the synthetic acaricide coumaphos (used by beekeepers to control the parasitic mite Varroa destructor) were higher in control colonies than CCD-affected colonies.  Conclusions/Significance This is the first comprehensive survey of CCD-affected bee populations that suggests CCD involves an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors. We present evidence that this condition is contagious or the result of exposure to a common risk factor.

To compare these theoretical results to experimental data. gold nanoparticles in the size range of 5 to 100 nm were synthesized and characterized with TEM and UV−vis. Excellent agreement was found between theory and experiment. It is shown that the data produced here can be used to determine both size and concentration of gold nanoparticles directly from UV−vis spectra. Equations for this purpose are derived. and the precision of various methods is discussed.

Established techniques have provided both qualitative and quantitative information regarding these interactions. leading to a general view that proteins bind with a variety of affinities to particular sequences within heparin or heparan sulfate chains.

119761,Fibroblast growth factors and their receptors: an information network controlling tissue growth. morphogenesis and repair,1994,David G Fernig and John T Gallagher,5,,4,353-377,Pergamon,The stimulation of cellular metabolism by the nine fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) is mediated by a dual-receptor system. This comprises a family of four receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR) and heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG). The stimulation of cell division by FGFs has an obligate requirement for both partners of the dual-receptor system. The binding of the nine FGFs to the FGFRs is marked by a pattern of overlapping specificity despite alternative splicing events generating a large number of FGFR proteins. Thus many of the FGFR isoforms bind several FGFs. It is likely that each FGF requires a different pattern of sulphation within the heparan sulphate chains for binding. Therefore. the HSPG receptors may provide additional specificity. allowing a cell to fine tune its response to the FGFs present in the extracellular milieu.

In this interim report findings are presented concerning disease-free survival (DFS) and survival as related to age and to estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) content of the tumor. The median follow-up time is 3 yr. Patients 50 yr of age or older with either 1-3 or more than 3 positive axillary nodes had a markedly longer disease-free survival on PFT than did those receiving PF adjuvant therapy (p< 0.001).

Neuromelanin accumulates during aging and is the catecholamine-derived pigment of the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra and norepinephrine neurons of the locus coeruleus. the two neuronal populations most targeted in Parkinson's disease. Many cellular redox reactions rely on iron. however an altered distribution of reactive iron is cytotoxic. In fact. increased levels of iron in the brain of Parkinson's disease patients are present. Dopamine accumulation can induce neuronal death; however. excess dopamine can be removed by converting it into a stable compound like neuromelanin. and this process rescues the cell.

The oxidation of DA by Mn3+. which appears to be irreversible. results in a decrease in the level of DA. but not in a formation of reactive oxygen species. since oxygen is neither consumed nor required in this reaction. The formation of cDAoQ can initiate the generation of superoxide radicals (O·2−) by reduction-oxidation cycling. i.e. one-electron reduction of the quinone by various NADH-or NADPH-dependent flavoproteins to the semiquinone (QH·). which is readily reoxidized by O2 with the concomitant formation of O·2−.

Multidimensional HPLC separation techniques provide access to even more complex mixtures of proteins. A set of techniques for multidimensional analysis was developed in our lab; collectively they are known as multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT). These strategies employ a biphasic column with a section of reversed phase (RP) material flanked by strong cation exchange (SCX) resin and allow for multidimensional separation of peptides. A variation on MudPIT adds an additional section of RP material behind the SCX and RP.

This is especially true for shotgun proteomic techniques that can generate tens of thousands of spectra per instrument each day. One design factor leading to many of these problems is caused by storing spectra and the database identifications for a given spectrum as individual files. While these problems can be addressed by storing all of the spectra and search results in large relational databases. the infrastructure to implement such a strategy can be beyond the means of academic labs.

To complement other methods for classical signal peptide prediction we here present a publicly available method. TatP. for prediction of bacterial Tat signal peptides. We have retrieved sequence data for Tat substrates in order to train a computational method for discrimination of Sec and Tat signal peptides. The TatP method is able to positively classify 91% of 35 known Tat signal peptides and 84% of the annotated cleavage sites of these Tat signal peptides were correctly predicted. This method generates far less false positive predictions on various datasets than using simple pattern matching. Moreover. on the same datasets TatP generates less false positive predictions than a complementary rule based prediction method. The method developed here is able to discriminate Tat signal peptides from cytoplasmic proteins carrying a similar motif. as well as from Sec signal peptides. with high accuracy. The method allows filtering of input sequences based on Perl syntax regular expressions. whereas hydrophobicity discrimination of Tat- and Sec-signal peptides is carried out by an artificial neural network.

We describe here the identification of a novel component of a bacterial Sec-independent translocase. The system probably functions in a similar manner to a Sec-independent translocase in the thylakoid membrane. and substrates for both systems bear a characteristic twin-arginine motif in the targeting peptide. The translocase component is encoded inEscherichia coli by an unassigned reading frame.yigU. disruption of which blocks the export of at least five twin-Arg-containing precursor proteins that are predicted to bind redox cofactors. and hence fold. prior to translocation.

The importance of the individual amino acids of the consensus motif forin vivo Tat transport has been assessed by site-directed mutagenesis of the signal peptide of the Tat substrate pre-SufI. Although the invariant arginine residues are crucial for efficient export. we find that slow transport of SufI is still possible if a single arginine is conservatively substituted by a lysine residue. Thus. in at least one signal peptide context there is no absolute dependence of Tat transport on the arginine pair.

The SASP reinforces senescence and activates an immune surveillance response. but it can also show pro-tumorigenic properties and contribute to age-related pathologies. In a drug screen to find new SASP regulators. we uncovered the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as a potent SASP suppressor. Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. In turn. MAPKAPK2 phosphorylates the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1 during senescence. inhibiting its ability to degrade the transcripts of numerous SASP components.

119883,ALS-associated TDP-43 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress. which drives cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation and stress granule formation,2013,Adam K Walker and Kai Y Soo and Vinod Sundaramoorthy and Sonam Parakh and Yi Ma and Manal A Farg and Robyn H Wallace and Peter J Crouch and Bradley J Turner and Malcolm K Horne and Julie D Atkin,8,PloS one,11,e81170,Public Library of Science,In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) accumulates in the cytoplasm of affected neurons and glia. where it associates with stress granules (SGs) and forms large inclusions. SGs form in response to cellular stress. including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. which is induced in both familial and sporadic forms of ALS. Here we demonstrate that pharmacological induction of ER stress causes TDP-43 to accumulate in the cytoplasm. where TDP-43 also associates with SGs. Furthermore. treatment with salubrinal. an inhibitor of dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-α. a key modulator of ER stress. potentiates ER stress-mediated SG formation. Inclusions of C-terminal fragment TDP-43. reminiscent of disease-pathology. form in close association with ER and Golgi compartments. further indicating the involvement of ER dysfunction in TDP-43-associated disease. Consistent with this notion. over-expression of ALS-linked mutant TDP-43. and to a lesser extent wildtype TDP-43. triggers several ER stress pathways in neuroblastoma cells. Similarly. we found an interaction between the ER chaperone protein disulphide isomerase and TDP-43 in transfected cell lysates and in the spinal cords of mutant A315T TDP-43 transgenic mice.

119884,Multifaceted deaths orchestrated by mitochondria in neurones,2010,Phillip Nagley and Gavin C Higgins and Julie D Atkin and Philip M Beart,1802,,1,167-185,Elsevier,Neurones undergo diverse forms of cell death depending on the nature and severity of the stress. These death outcomes are now classified into various types of programmed cell death. including apoptosis. autophagy and necrosis. Each of these pathways can run in parallel and all have mitochondria as a central feature. Recruitment of mitochondria into cell death signalling involves either (or both) induction of specific death responses through release of apoptogenic proteins into the cytosol. or perturbation in function leading to loss of mitochondrial energisation and ATP synthesis. Cross-talk between these signalling pathways. particularly downstream of mitochondria. determines the resultant pattern of cell death. The differential recruitment of specific death pathways depends on the timing of engagement of mitochondrial signalling.

119885,The unfolded protein response and the role of protein disulfide isomerase in neurodegeneration,2016,Emma R Perri and Colleen J Thomas and Sonam Parakh and Damian M Spencer and Julie D Atkin,3,,,80,Frontiers,The maintenance and regulation of proteostasis is a critical function for post-mitotic neurons and dysregulation of proteostasis is increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Despite having different clinical manifestations. these disorders share similar pathology; an accumulation of misfolded proteins in neurons and subsequent disruption to cellular proteostasis. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important component of proteostasis. and when the accumulation of misfolded proteins occurs within the ER. this disturbs ER homeostasis. giving rise to ER stress. This triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). distinct signalling pathways that whilst initially protective. are pro-apoptotic if ER stress is prolonged. ER stress is increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. and emerging evidence highlights the complexity of the UPR in these disorders. with both protective and detrimental components being described. Protein Disulphide Isomerase (PDI) is an ER chaperone induced during ER stress that is responsible for the formation of disulphide bonds in proteins. Whilst initially considered to be protective. recent studies have revealed unconventional roles for PDI in neurodegenerative diseases. distinct from its normal function in the UPR and the ER. although these mechanisms remain poorly defined. However specific aspects of PDI function may offer the potential to be exploited therapeutically in the future. This review will focus on the evidence linking ER stress and the UPR to neurodegenerative diseases. with particular emphasis on the emerging functions ascribed to PDI in these conditions.,True,eG9lQ2cAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,105,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2015.00080/full,13193745158560479390,/scholar?cites=13193745158560479390,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2015.00080/full,0,0,0

Most of the cell-associated pro-uPA is on the cell surface. as shown by indirect immunofluorescence and by surface lodination. Pro-uPA is not an integral membrane protein but is bound to a specific surface receptor that is completely saturated. A mild acid treatment uncovers the surface receptors by dissociating pro-uPA. Resaturation of uncovered receptors has been studied by reincubating cells in normal medium; within 40 min. 50% of the free sites are reoccupied. Excess uPA-specific antibodies prevent rebinding of ligand to the receptors. Thus. A431 cells first secrete uPA. which then binds to the surface receptor.

The magnitude of this signal is restricted by desensitization of the receptors through their binding to β-arrestins and by cAMP degradation by phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes. We show that β-arrestins coordinate both processes by recruiting PDEs to activated β2-adrenergic receptors in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. In doing so. the β-arrestins limit activation of membrane-associated cAMP-activated protein kinase by simultaneously slowing the rate of cAMP production through receptor desensitization and increasing the rate of its degradation at the membrane.,True,cv-TPggAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC,538,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5594/834.abstract,9140205921651391549,/scholar?cites=9140205921651391549,,,0,0,0

The transition between early and late endosomes could be mediated either through transport carriers or by Rab conversion. a process in which the loss of Rab5 from an endosome occurs concomitantly to the acquisition of Rab7. We demonstrate that Rab conversion is the mechanism by which proteins pass from early to late endosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans coelomocytes. Moreover. we identified SAND-1/Mon1 as the critical switch for Rab conversion in metazoa. SAND-1 serves a dual role in this process. First. it interrupts the positive feedback loop of RAB-5 activation by displacing RABX-5 from endosomal membranes; second. it times the recruitment of RAB-7. probably through interaction with the HOPS complex to the same membranes.

To make such a vesicle. cytosolic coat proteins assemble on a donor membrane and deform it into a bud. Cargo proteins are sorted into the originating vesicle. which then separates from the donor membrane. travels a certain distance. and finally fuses with the acceptor organelle.At the time of vesicle budding. three specific requirements have to be fulfilled in order to produce a functional vesicle. First. different vesicular transport processes are mediated by different coat protein complexes. and therefore a donor membrane must attract the correct species of cytosolic coat proteins. Second. a transport vesicle needs to be equipped with certain membrane proteins that have essential tasks at a later stage. v-SNAREs. for example. are required for fusion with the acceptor membrane (reviewed by,True,-ZDsUQ0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,329,https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(00)80722-9?scriptOff=true&code=cell-site,11542407812283990377,/scholar?cites=11542407812283990377,,https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(00)80722-9?scriptOff=true&code=cell-site,0,0,0

Pseudomonas aeruginosa undergoes genetic adaptation resulting in progressively increased persistence and the generation of adaptive colony morphotypes. This includes small colony variants (SCVs). auto-aggregative. hyper-adherent cells whose appearance correlates with poor lung function and persistence of infection. The SCV morphotype is strongly linked to elevated levels of cyclic-di-GMP. a ubiquitous bacterial second messenger that regulates the transition between motile and sessile. cooperative lifestyles. A genetic screen in PA01 for SCV-related loci identified the yfiBNR operon. encoding a tripartite signaling module that regulates c-di-GMP levels in P. aeruginosa. Subsequent analysis determined that YfiN is a membrane-integral diguanylate cyclase whose activity is tightly controlled by YfiR. a small periplasmic protein. and the OmpA/Pal-like outer-membrane lipoprotein YfiB. Exopolysaccharide synthesis was identified as the principal downstream target for YfiBNR. with increased production of Pel and Psl exopolysaccharides responsible for many characteristic SCV behaviors.

Proteasome-mediated degradation requires previous ubiquitylation of the cargo. which is then recognized by ubiquitin receptors directing it to 26S proteasomes. Although autophagy has long been viewed as a random cytoplasmic degradation system. the involvement of ubiquitin as a specificity factor for selective autophagy is rapidly emerging. Recent evidence also suggests active crosstalk between proteasome-mediated degradation and selective autophagy. Here. we discuss the molecular mechanisms that link autophagy and the proteasome system. as well as the emerging roles of ubiquitin and ubiquitin …,True,L8oRIVYAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,609,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb0910-836,7431581193578451661,/scholar?cites=7431581193578451661,,,0,0,0

Cyclin B and securin ubiquitination depend on a destruction box (D box) sequence in these proteins. but how APC/C bound to Cdc20 or Cdh1 recognizes the D box is poorly understood. By using site-specific photocrosslinking in combination with mutational analyses. we show that the D box directly interacts with an evolutionarily conserved surface on the predicted WD40 propeller structure of Cdh1 and that this interaction is essential for processive substrate ubiquitination. We further show that Cdh1 specifically crosslinks to the APC/C subunit Cdc27 and that Cdh1 binding to APC/C depends on the presence of Cdc27.

The complexity of apoE results from post-translational modification with carbohydrate chains containing sialic acid (7. 8) and from genetic polymorphism in the human population (3. 8-10). The early genetic models could not explain satisfactorily the genetic polymorphism of human apoE (3. 10). According to the currently accepted genetic model (8. 9). there exist three alleles at a single genetic locus that specify six different apoE phenotypes. These phenotypes can be presently recognized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and one-dimensional isoelectric focusing (1 1-13). Consistent with this genetic model. recent studies suggest that the different apoE alleles may result from point mutations in the structural apoE gene (11). Amino acid analysis and sequence data demonstrate that the three major isoforms of apoE (E-2. E-3. and E-4) differ by a single amino acid involving cysteine-arginine interchanges. These interchanges account for the known charge differences between the major apoE isoforms (8. ll).

Evidence that weak hydrogen bonds play an enormously important role in chemistry and biochemistry has now accumulated to an extent that the rigid classical concept of hydrogen bonds formulated by Pauling needs to be seriously revised and extended. The concept of a more generalized hydrogen bond definition is indispensable for understanding the folding mechanisms of proteins.

We ascertain the importance of the core by showing the sequence entropies of the residues comprising the core to be smaller than those in the rim. Such a distinction is not seen in the 2-fold-related. nonphysiological interfaces formed in crystal lattices of monomeric proteins. thereby providing a procedure for characterizing the oligomeric state from crystal structures of protein molecules. This method is better than those that rely on the comparison of the sequence entropies in the interface and the rest of the protein surface. especially in cases where the surface harbors additional binding sites. To a good approximation there is a correlation between the accessible surface area lost because of complexation and ΔΔG values obtained through alanine-scanning mutagenesis (26-38 cal per Å2 of the surface buried) for residues located in the core. a …,True,_GWvQiMAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,264,https://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15447.short,4743951894506861733,/scholar?cites=4743951894506861733,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/102/43/15447.full.pdf,0,0,0

X-ray fibre diffraction studies have shown that the protofilament cores of fibrils formed from the various proteins all contain a cross-β-scaffold. with β-strands perpendicular and β-sheets parallel to the fibre axis. We have determined the threedimensional structure of an amyloid fibril. formed by the SH3 domain of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. using cryo-electron microscopy and image processing at 25 Å resolution. The structure is a double helix of two protofilament pairs wound around a hollow core. with a helical crossover repeat of~ 600 Å and an axial subunit repeat of~ 27 Å. The native SH3 domain is too compact to fit into the fibril density …,True,JlK8BBwAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,599,https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1093/emboj/18.4.815,13442477886839262395,/scholar?cites=13442477886839262395,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1093/emboj/18.4.815,0,0,0

Recent structural and biophysical studies show that protein dimerization or oligomerization is a key factor in the regulation of proteins such as enzymes. ion channels. receptors and transcription factors. In addition. self-association can help to minimize genome size. while maintaining the advantages of modular complex formation. Oligomerization. however. can also have deleterious consequences when nonnative oligomers associated with pathogenic states are generated.

Fibrillogenesis is critically dependent on the pH and the ionic strength of the solution. with low pH and high ionic strength favoring fibril formation. The morphology of the fibrils formed varies with the growth conditions. At pH 4 in 0.4 M NaCl the fibrils are ∼10 nm wide. relatively short (50−200 nm). and curvilinear. By contrast. at pH 1.6 the fibrils formed have the same width and morphology as those formed at pH 4 but extend to more than 600 nm in length.

120038,Allyl sulfur compounds and cellular detoxification system: effects and perspectives in cancer therapy,2011,Sm Melino and R Sabelli and M Paci,41,,1,103-112,Springer Vienna,Natural organosulfur compounds (OSCs) have been shown to have chemopreventive effects and to suppress the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro through the induction of apoptosis. The biochemical mechanisms underlying the antitumorigenic and anti-proliferative effects of garlic-derived OSCs are not fully understood. Several modes of action of these compounds have been proposed. and it seems likely that the rate of clearance of allyl sulfur groups from cells is a determinant of the overall response. The aim of this review is to focus attention on the effects of natural allyl sulfur compounds on the cell detoxification system in normal and tumor cells. It has been already reported that several natural allyl sulfur compounds induce chemopreventive effects by affecting xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and inducing their down-activation. Moreover. different effects of water- and oil-soluble allyl sulfur compounds …,True,3YPBcvkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,57,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00726-010-0522-6.pdf,17848612282750716310,/scholar?cites=17848612282750716310,,https://art.torvergata.it/bitstream/2108/13110/2/paci.pdf,0,0,0

This structure shows features that are unique for this complex. including an active role of the linker connecting the N- and C-lobes of calmodulin upon binding of the peptide. Such linker is not only involved in the formation of an hydrophobic pocket to accommodate a bulky peptide residue. but it also provides a positively charged region complementary to a negative charge of the target. This complex of calmodulin with a target not belonging to the kinase family was used to test the residual dipolar coupling (RDC) approach for the determination of calmodulin binding modes to peptides. Although the complex here characterized belongs to the (1--14) family. high Q values were obtained with all the 1:1 complexes for which crystalline structures are available.

If and how this abundant and normally stable complex is degraded by cells is largely unknown. Here we show that in yeast. upon nitrogen starvation. proteasomes are targeted for vacuolar degradation through autophagy. Using GFP-tagged proteasome subunits. we observed that autophagy of a core particle (CP) subunit depends on the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp3. although a regulatory particle (RP) subunit does not.

120073,Heme-containing oxygenases,1996,Masanori Sono and Mark P Roach and Eric D Coulter and John H Dawson,96,,7,2841-2888,American Chemical Society,Dioxygen (O2) serves two essential functions in aerobic life. It is both a terminal electron acceptor and a biosynthetic reagent. It is this latter role for dioxygen that will be the focus of this review: the incorporation of one or both of the oxygen atoms of dioxygen into organic substrates by heme enzymes. These dioxygen-utilizing reactions involve the cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond and are very energetically favorable. ie. exothermic. Despite this strong thermodynamic driving force. the chemical reactivity of dioxygen with organic molecules at ambient temperatures is intrinsically low. If this were not the case. dioxygen would spontaneously oxidize organic compounds and would therefore be harmful or even fatal rather than useful for living things. The low kinetic reactivity of dioxygen is due to its triplet ground state; ie. it is a diradical having two unpaired electrons.

Spectroscopic determination of their active-site structures and mechanistic implications of thiolate ligation,1987,John H Dawson and Masanori Sono,87,,5,1255-1276,American Chemical Society,In order to fully understand how a catalytic system operates. it is necessary to establish the structure of the functional unit as well as to determine the changes that the catalytic center undergoes during the reaction cycle. For metalloenzymes. the concept of structure can be broken down into twocategories: the structure of the metal binding site (s) and the structure of the protein itself. In this context. cytochrome P-450 and chloroperoxidase are a particularly intriguing pair in light of the extensive evidence that will be presented inthis review article that the two enzymes have essentially identical heme iron coordination structures.

The basicity of the CPO-II ferryl [pKa > 8.2 (where Ka is the acid dissociation constant)] is attributable to strong electron donation by the axial thiolate. We suggest that the CPO-II protonated ferryl is a good model for the rebound intermediate in the P450 oxygenation cycle;with elevated pKa values after one-electron reduction. thiolate-ligated ferryl radicals are competent to oxygenate saturated hydrocarbons at potentials that can be tolerated by folded polypeptide hosts.,True,VrOpzVYAAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC,472,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/304/5677/1653.abstract,16536931730864809422,/scholar?cites=16536931730864809422,,,0,0,0

For ferric P-450. the binding of all sulfur donors is competitive with substrate binding. Addition of thiols to P-450 leads to interconvertible thiol or thiolate-bound species depending on the thiol acidity (pKa) and the solution ph; ligation of thiols lowers their pKa by about 4 units. In contrast. only the thiolate-bound form is seen for myoglobin regardless of thiol acidity or solution pH (5.5-11.0). indicating that the heme iron of myoglobin is less electron-rich than that of P-450.

Indeed. chloride transporters have direct medical potential as treatments for cystic fibrosis and other diseases caused by defective channel proteins.[2] Despite this motivation. there have been relatively few reports of anionophore natural products [3] or of anion transport by synthetic systems.[4] Most. moreover. have involved cationic centers.[5] which can assist anion passage through the formation of an ion pair.[4a–g] Anion transport by purely electroneutral systems is still quite rare.[4j–l] The recently described “cholapod” anion receptors 1 are intrinsically lipophilic. potentially membranesoluble. and tuneable to very high affinities.[6] Certain cholapods have proved …,True,3Os7Q-8AAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C,202,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.200351957,15351862385761945228,/scholar?cites=15351862385761945228,,https://www3.nd.edu/~bsmith3/pdf/AC2003.pdf,0,0,0

The enhanced binding is due to a cooperative polarization effect which is induced by intramolecular coordination of the urea or amide carbonyl to a Lewis acidic boronate group. A series of boronate-ureas. 3. and a related bis(boronate-amide). 23. were prepared in two steps from 2-(aminophenyl)boronic acid and their structures elucidated using X-ray crystallography and other spectrometric methods.

There is substantial evidence for the health benefits of algal-derived food products. but there remain considerable challenges in quantifying these benefits. as well as possible adverse effects. First. there is a limited understanding of nutritional composition across algal species. geographical regions. and seasons. all of which can substantially affect their dietary value.

Unlike the design of conventional alloys. which is based on one or at most two principal elements. the design of HEA is based on multi‐principal elements in equal or near‐equal atomic ratio. The advent of HEA has revived the alloy design perception and paved the way to produce an ample number of compositions with different combinations of promising properties for a variety of structural applications. Among the properties possessed by HEAs. sluggish diffusion and strength retention at elevated temperature have caught wide attention.

The Ca2+ sensor required for fast fusion is synaptotagmin-1. The activation energy of bilayer-bilayer fusion is very high (≈40 kBT). We found that. in response to Ca2+ binding. synaptotagmin-1 could promote SNARE-mediated fusion by lowering this activation barrier by inducing high positive curvature in target membranes on C2-domain membrane insertion. Thus. synaptotagmin-1 triggers the fusion of docked vesicles by local Ca2+-dependent buckling of the plasma membrane together with the zippering of SNAREs.

The accumulation is GTP-dependent and requires live parasites. Vacuolar IIGP1 accumulations undergo a maturation-like process accompanied by vesiculation of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. This culminates in disruption of the parasitophorous vacuole and finally of the parasite itself. Over-expression of IIGP1 leads to accelerated vacuolar disruption whereas a dominant negative form of IIGP1 interferes with interferon-γ-mediated killing of intracellular parasites.

However. concerns over the potential impact of pesticides on human health and the environment has led to the introduction of new pesticide registration procedures. such as the Food Quality Protection Act in the United States. These new regulations have reduced the number of synthetic pesticides available in agriculture. Therefore. the current paradigm of relying almost exclusively on chemicals for pest control may need to be reconsidered. New pesticides. including natural product-based pesticides are being discovered and developed to replace the compounds lost due to the new registration requirements.

Hepcidin-based therapeutics/diagnostics could play roles in hematology in the future. and thus. hepcidin transport is crucial to understand. In this study. we identify α2-macroglobulin (α2-M) as the specific hepcidin-binding molecule in blood. Interaction of 125I-hepcidin with α2-M was identified using fractionation of plasma proteins followed by native gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Hepcidin binding to nonactivated α2-M displays high affinity (Kd 177 ± 27 nM). whereas hepcidin binding to albumin was nonspecific and displayed nonsaturable kinetics. Surprisingly. the interaction of hepcidin with activated α2-M exhibited a classical sigmoidal binding curve demonstrating cooperative binding of 4 high-affinity (Kd 0.3 μM) hepcidin-binding sites.

Although these models have identified the key features in the regulation and control of erythrocyte metabolism. many important aspects remain unexplained. In particular. none of these models have satisfactorily accounted for 2.3-bisphosphoglycerate (2.3-BPG) metabolism. 2.3-BPG is an important modulator of haemoglobin oxygen affinity. and hence an understanding of the regulation of 2.3-BPG concentration is important for understanding blood oxygen transport. A detailed. comprehensive. and hence realistic mathematical model of erythrocyte metabolism is presented that can explain the regulation and control of 2.3-BPG concentration and turnover.

120216,Purification and cloning of a DNA binding protein from yeast that binds to both silencer and activator elements,1987,David Shore and Kim Nasmyth,51,Cell,5,721-732,Cell Press,A DNA binding protein (RAP1. previously called SBF-E) has been shown to bind to putative regulatory sites at both yeast mating-type silencers. yet is not the product of genetically identified regulators of the silent loci. Here. we report the purification of RAP1 by DNA affinity chromatography. and the isolation of its gene from a λgt11 genomic library using antibodies raised against the protein. Disruption of the chromosomal copy of this gene is lethal. We show that RAP1 protein also binds in vitro to the upstream activation site (UAS) of MATα and ribosomal protein genes. In addition. we show that two different UAS-associated RAP1 binding sites can substitute in vivo for a silencer binding site. Our results suggest that RAP1 may be a transcriptional regulator that can play a role in either repression or activation of transcription. depending upon the context of its binding site.,True,P-HVid0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,629,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009286748790095X,2544041462152316841,/scholar?cites=2544041462152316841,,,0,0,0

This length regulation was shown to function independently of the orientation of the telomere repeats. The number of repeats at an individual telomere was reduced when hybrid proteins containing the Rap1p carboxyl terminus were targeted there by a heterologous DNA-binding domain.

RAP1 is also involved in the regulation of telomere structure. where its binding sites are found within the terminal poly(C1-3A) sequences. Previous studies have indicated that the regulatory function of RAP1 is determined by the context of its binding site and. presumably. its interactions with other factors.

The j factor is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium constants for cyclization and for bimolecular association via the cohesive ends. The end-joining reactions are fast compared to covalent closure of the cohesive ends by T4 DNA ligase. The rate of ligase closure is shown to be proportional to the equilibrium fraction of DNA molecules with joined cohesive ends. both in cyclization and in bimolecular association reactions. The j factor changes by less than 10-fold between 242 and 4361 bp. whereas it decreases by more than 100-fold between 242 and 126 bp as the DNA reaches the size range of the persistence length (150 bp).

The cyclization probability is proportional to Kc. the equilibrium constant for cyclization of the restriction fragment via its cohesive ends (Shore et al.. 1981). Here we vary the twist of the DNA by making small internal additions to or deletions from a 242 bp EcoRI restriction fragment. A series of 12 DNA molecules has been studied. which range in length from 237 to 254 bp. The cyclization probability is measured from the rates of covalent closure by phage T4 DNA ligase of two systems: (1) a linear restriction fragment in equilibrium with its cyclized form and (2) half molecules (cut by a blunt-end endonuclease) in equilibrium with joined half molecules.The striking result is that. in this DNA size range. the j-factor depends strongly on the …,True,P-HVid0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,454,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283683801983,14504686807508588315,/scholar?cites=14504686807508588315,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50413380/Energetics_of_DNA_twisting._I._Relation_20161119-3695-1g4o02e.pdf,0,0,0

Rap1p initiates silencing at telomeres by interacting through its carboxy-terminal domain with Sir3p and Sir4p. both of which are required for repression. This same domain of Rap1p also negatively regulates telomere elongation. through an unknown mechanism. We have identified a new Rap1-interacting factor (Rif2p) that plays a role in telomere length regulation. Rif2p has considerable functional similarities with a Rap1p-interacting factor (Rif1p) identified previously.

These include the silencers at the transcriptionally repressed mating-type genes. the promoters of many genes important for cell growth. and the poly[(cytosine)1-3 adenine] [poly(C1-3A)] repeats of telomeres.

Consistent with this finding. selective activation of the p38MAPK signaling pathway by expression of MKK6b(E). a constitutive activator of p38MAPK. significantly reduced LDL receptor promoter activity. Expression of the p38MAPK α-isoform had a similar effect. whereas expression of the p38MAPK βII-isoform had no significant effect on LDL receptor promoter activity.

Sister chromatids must remain linked to each other from the time of DNA replication until the onset of chromosome segregation. when the linkage must be promptly dissolved. Recent studies suggest that the machinery that is responsible for the destruction of mitotic cyclins also degrades proteins that play a role in maintaining sister chromatid linkage. and that this machinery is regulated by the spindle-assembly checkpoint. Studies on these problems in budding yeast are hampered by the inability to resolve its chromosomes by light or electron microscopy.Results We have developed a novel method for visualizing specific DNA sequences in fixed and living budding yeast cells.

Perturbation of septin organization in cells by expression of a septin-interacting fragment of anillin or by septin depletion via siRNA causes loss of actin bundles.

Experiments measuring the mechanical resistance of β-sheet proteins extended by their termini led to the hypothesis that parallel. directly hydrogen-bonded terminal β-strands provide the greatest mechanical strength. Here we test this hypothesis by measuring the mechanical properties of protein L. a domain with a topology predicted to be mechanically strong. but with no known mechanical function. A pentamer of this small. topologically simple protein is resistant to mechanical deformation over a wide range of extension rates. Molecular dynamics simulations show the energy landscape for protein L is highly restricted for mechanical unfolding and that this protein unfolds by the shearing apart of two structural units in a mechanism similar to that proposed for ubiquitin. which belongs to the same structural class as …,True,J1Ehb3AAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,173,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349505726990,10403616017879975026,/scholar?cites=10403616017879975026,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349505726990,0,0,0

To investigate the molecular basis of this mechanical stability. protein engineering Φ-value analysis has been combined with atomic force microscopy to investigate the structure of the barrier to forced unfolding. The results indicate that the transition state for forced unfolding is significantly structured. since highly destabilising mutations in the core do not affect the force required to unfold the protein. As has been shown before. mechanical strength lies in the region of the A′ and G-strands but. contrary to previous suggestions. the results indicate clearly that side-chain interactions play a significant role in maintaining mechanical stability.

Here. we apply a recent theoretical approach describing molecular rupture in the presence of force to unfolding kinetic data obtained from coarse-grained simulations of ubiquitin. Unfolding rates calculated from simulations over a broad range of stretching forces. for different pulling directions. reveal a remarkable “turnover” from a force-independent process at low force to a force-dependent process at high force. akin to the “roll-over” in unfolding rates sometimes seen in studies using chemical denaturant.

120305,Probing protein structure by limited proteolysis.,2004,Angelo Fontana and Patrizia Polverino De Laureto and Barbara Spolaore and Erica Frare and Paola Picotti and Marcello Zambonin,51,,2,299-321,,Limited proteolysis experiments can be successfully used to probe conformational features of proteins. In a number of studies it has been demonstrated that the sites of limited proteolysis along the polypeptide chain of a protein are characterized by enhanced backbone flexibility. implying that proteolytic probes can pinpoint the sites of local unfolding in a protein chain. Limited proteolysis was used to analyze the partly folded (molten globule) states of several proteins. such as apomyoglobin. alpha-lactalbumin. calcium-binding lysozymes. cytochrome c and human growth hormone. These proteins were induced to acquire the molten globule state under specific solvent conditions. such as low pH. In general. the protein conformational features deduced from limited proteolysis experiments nicely correlate with those deriving from other biophysical and spectroscopic techniques. Limited proteolysis is also most useful for isolating protein fragments that can fold autonomously and thus behave as protein domains. Moreover. the technique can be used to identify and prepare protein fragments that are able to associate into a native-like and often functional protein complex. Overall. our results underscore the utility of the limited proteolysis approach for unravelling molecular features of proteins and appear to prompt its systematic use as a simple first step in the elucidation of structure-dynamics-function relationships of a novel and rare protein. especially if available in minute amounts.,True,Z0F-DpUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,503,https://ojs.ptbioch.edu.pl/index.php/abp/article/view/3573,2561894054484995447,/scholar?cites=2561894054484995447,,https://ojs.ptbioch.edu.pl/index.php/abp/article/download/3573/2631,0,0,0

In contrast. holoMb is resistant to proteolytic digestion when reacted under identical experimental conditions. Such selective proteolysis implies that the F-helix of native holoMb (residues 82 to 97) is disordered in apoMb. thus enabling binding and adaptation of this chain segment at the active site of the proteolytic enzymes for an efficient peptide bond fission.

We suggest that a “simplified” model. in which fidelity is derived fundamentally from differential substrate binding at the transition state of a rate-limiting chemical step. is consistent with known data and sufficient to explain the substrate selectivity of these enzymes. ,True,MoI7hB0AAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC,169,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi026021i,10192432013773109123,/scholar?cites=10192432013773109123,,http://www.bc.sinica.edu.tw/MDTsai/2002/bi026021i%5B1%5D.pdf,0,0,0

Recently. IL-33 was identified as a functional ligand of ST2L. allowing exploration of the role of ST2 in myocardium. We found that IL-33 was a biomechanically induced protein predominantly synthesized by cardiac fibroblasts. IL-33 markedly antagonized angiotensin II– and phenylephrine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Although IL-33 activated NF-κB. it inhibited angiotensin II– and phenylephrine-induced phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-κBα (IκBα) and NF-κB nuclear binding activity. sST2 blocked antihypertrophic effects of IL-33. indicating that sST2 functions in myocardium as a soluble decoy receptor.

Here we describe red. single-wavelength GECIs. “RCaMPs”. engineered from circular permutation of the thermostable red fluorescent protein mRuby. High-resolution crystal structures of mRuby. the red sensor RCaMP. and the recently published red GECI R-GECO1 give insight into the chromophore environments of the Ca2+-bound state of the sensors and the engineered protein domain interfaces of the different indicators. We characterized the biophysical properties and performance of RCaMP sensors in vitro and in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans. Drosophila larvae. and larval zebrafish. Further. we demonstrate 2-color calcium imaging both within the same cell (registering mitochondrial and somatic [Ca2+]) and between two populations of cells: neurons and astrocytes. Finally. we perform integrated optogenetics experiments. wherein neural activation via channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or a red-shifted variant. and activity imaging via RCaMP or GCaMP. are conducted simultaneously. with the ChR2/RCaMP pair providing independently addressable spectral channels.

The CODH family. for which the R. rubrum enzyme is the prototype. catalyzes the biological oxidation of CO at an unusual Ni-Fe-S cluster called the C-cluster. The Ni-Fe-S C-cluster contains a mononuclear site and a four-metal cubane. Surprisingly. anomalous dispersion data suggest that the mononuclear site contains Fe and not Ni. and the four-metal cubane has the form [NiFe3S4] and not [Fe4S4]. The mononuclear site and the four-metal cluster are bridged by means of Cys531 and one of the sulfides of the cube.

120383,Effects of hydrogel amendment on water storage of sandy loam and loam soils and seedling growth of barley. wheat and chickpea,2004,J Akhter and K Mahmood and KA Malik and A Mardan and M Ahmad and MM Iqbal,50,Plant Soil and Environment,10,463-469,Institute of Agricultural and Food Information,The hydrogel amendments may improve seedling growth and establishment by increasing water retention capacity of soils and regulating the plants available water supplies. particularly under arid environments. The effects of different levels of a locally prepared hydrogel were studied on the moisture properties of sandy loam and loam soils (fine-loamy. mixed. hyperthermic Typic Haplargids. USDA. Luvic Yermosol. FAO) and on growth response of three plant species. viz. barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Water absorption by gel was rapid and highest in distilled water and was inhibited by an increase in water salinity. The addition of 0.1. 0.2 and 0.3% hydrogel increased the moisture retention (θr) at field capacity linearly (r= 0.988) and thus the amount of plant available water significantly in both sandy loam and loam soils compared to the untreated soils. Seed germination of wheat and barley was not affected but seedling growth of both species was improved by the gel amendment. In loam soil. seed germination of chickpea was higher with 0.2% gel and seedling growth increased with increase in gel level compared with control conditions.

The model derived from a computer simulation of morphogenesis assumes that: i) the cell surface expands from materials discharged by wall-destined vesicles. ii) vesicles are released from a postulated vesicle supply center (VSC). iii) vesicles move from the VSC to the surface in any random direction. The position and movement of the VSC become the critical determinant of morphogenesis: a stationary VSC releases vesicles that reach the cell surface in about equal numbers in all directions. and the cell grows as a sphere. Any displacement of the VSC from its original central position distorts the spherical shape. A sustained linear displacement of the VSC generates the typical cylindroid shape of fungal hyphae.

Long term or ultrashort stimulation of the ovaries after gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogue gave 55–60% blastocyst formation. Serum was not necessary to obtain blastocysts. When the embryos were cocultured. we observed an increase in the implantation rates per embryo in the pregnant patients. However. a real increase in the pregnancy rate per transfer was observed in a population of patients who had had repeated failures of embryo transfer. This observation is discussed as possibly bypassing an effect of uterine motility. but the overall beneficial effect has to be assessed in a double blind randomized study.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,In humans. age‐related decline in female fertility can be explained by a reduction in quality either of the older uterus or of the embryos arising from aging oocytes.  The aim of this study was to examine the latter hypothesis. using in vitro fertilization (I.V.F.) and coculture of embryos until the blastocyst stage.  We determined the blastocyst formation rate ([expanded blastocysts/blastocysts]*100) according to the patient's age the day of I.V.F.  With increase  in age. the number of retrieved oocytes decreased. without alteration of the cleavage rate.  In patients above age 30 years. preimplantation development to blastocysts declined due to an increase in embryo arrest at the morula stage.  If blastocyst stage was reached. a negative linear relationship between blastocyst expansion rate and patient age was observed.

Because of its importance for browning reactions in the food industry. the tyrosinase from the mushroom Agaricus bisporus has been investigated in depth. In previous studies the tyrosinase enzyme complex was shown to be a H2L2 tetramer. but no clues were obtained of the identities of the subunits. their mode of association. and the 3D structure of the complex. Here we unravel this tetramer at the molecular level. Its 2.3 Å resolution crystal structure is the first structure of the full fungal tyrosinase complex. The complex comprises two H subunits of ∼392 residues and two L subunits of ∼150 residues. The H subunit originates from the ppo3 gene and has a fold similar to other tyrosinases. but it is ∼100 residues larger.

This can result in a more enhanced innate and acquired disease resistance. The major immunomodulating effects of these active substances derived from mushrooms include mitogenicity and activation of immune effector cells. such as lymphocytes. macrophages. and natural killer cells. resulting in the production of cytokines. including interleukins (ILs). tumor necrosis factor  alpha  (TNF)-. and interferon gamma (INF)-. In particular. the ability of selective mushroom extracts to modulate the differentiation capacity of CD4 T cells to mature into T and/or T subsets will be discussed. As a consequence these extracts will have profound effects in particular diseases. like chronic autoimmune T-mediated or allergic T-mediated diseases. Immunosuppressive effects by mushroom components have also been observed. The therapeutic effects of mushrooms. such as anticancer activity. suppression of autoimmune diseases. and allergy have been associated with their immunomodulating effects.

The complex is sufficiently stable to be isolated by exclusion chromatography and contains ubiquitin/AMP in a ratio of 2.

During latent infection. EBV expresses 25 viral pre-microRNAs (miRNAs) and induces the expression of specific host miRNAs. such as miR-155 and miR-21. which potentially play a role in viral oncogenesis. To date. only a limited number of EBV miRNA targets have been identified; thus. the role of EBV miRNAs in viral pathogenesis and/or lymphomagenesis is not well defined. Here. we used photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) combined with deep sequencing and computational analysis to comprehensively examine the viral and cellular miRNA targetome in EBV strain B95-8-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). We identified 7.827 miRNA-interaction sites in 3.492 cellular 3′UTRs. 531 of these sites contained seed matches to viral miRNAs. 24 PAR-CLIP-identified miRNA:3′UTR interactions were confirmed by reporter assays. Our results reveal that EBV miRNAs predominantly target cellular transcripts during latent infection. thereby manipulating the host environment. Furthermore. targets of EBV miRNAs are involved in multiple cellular processes that are directly relevant to viral infection. including innate immunity. cell survival. and cell proliferation. Finally. we present evidence that myc-regulated host miRNAs from the miR-17/92 cluster can regulate latent viral gene expression.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,An innovative bioinformatic method has been designed and implemented to detect similar three‐dimensional (3D) sites in proteins. This approach allows the comparison of protein structures or substructures and detects local spatial similarities: this method is completely independent from the amino acid sequence and from the backbone structure. In contrast to already existing tools. the basis for this method is a representation of the protein structure by a set of stereochemical groups that are defined independently from the notion of amino acid. An efficient heuristic for finding similarities that uses graphs of triangles of chemical groups to represent the protein structures has been developed. The implementation of this heuristic constitutes a software named SuMo (Surfing the Molecules). which allows the dynamic definition of chemical groups. the selection of sites in the proteins. and the management and screening of …,True,ijx5ISwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,211,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/prot.10339,2664015893898639631,/scholar?cites=2664015893898639631,,,0,0,0
120535,Synthetic oligonucleotide probes deduced from amino acid sequence data: theoretical and practical considerations,1985,R Lathe,183,Journal of molecular biology,1,1-12,Academic Press,Synthetic probes deduced from amino acid sequence data are widely used to detect cognate coding sequences in libraries of cloned DNA segments. The redundancy of the genetic code dictates that a choice must be made between (1) a mixture of probes reflecting all codon combinations. and (2) a single longer “optimal” probe. The second strategy is examined in detail. The frequency of sequences matching a given probe by chance alone can be determined and also the frequency of sequences closely resembling the probe and contributing to the hybridization background. Gene banks cannot be treated as random associations of the four nucleotides. and probe sequences deduced from amino acid sequence data occur more often than predicted by chance alone. Probe lengths must be increased to confer the necessary specificity.

120541,Hormones and the hippocampus.,2001,R Lathe,169,,2,205-231,,Hippocampal lesions produce memory deficits. but the exact function of the hippocampus remains obscure. Evidence is presented that its role in memory may be ancillary to physiological regulation. Molecular studies demonstrate that the hippocampus is a primary target for ligands that reflect body physiology. including ion balance and blood pressure. immunity. pain. reproductive status. satiety and stress. Hippocampal receptors are functional. probably accessible to their ligands. and mediate physiological and cognitive changes. This argues that an early role of the hippocampus may have been in sensing soluble molecules (termed here'enteroception') in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. perhaps reflecting a common evolutionary origin with the olfactory system ('exteroception'). Functionally. hippocampal enteroception may reflect feedback control; evidence is reviewed that the hippocampus modulates body physiology. including the activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. blood pressure. immunity. and reproductive function. It is suggested that the hippocampus operates. in parallel with the amygdala. to modulate body physiology in response to cognitive stimuli. Hippocampal outputs are predominantly inhibitory on downstream neuroendocrine activity; increased synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus (eg long-term potentiation) could facilitate throughput inhibition.

Redox potentiometry studies have been performed with intact flavocytochrome P-450 BM3 and with its component heme. diflavin. FAD. and FMN domains. Results indicate that elctron flow occurs from the NADPH donor through FAD. then FMN and on to the heme center where fatty acid substrate is bound and monooxygenation occurs. Prevention of futile cycling of electrons is avoided through an increase in redox potential of more than 100 mV caused by binding of fatty acids to the active site of P-450. Redox potentials are little altered for the component domains with respect to their values in the larger constructs. providing further evidence for the discrete domain organization of this flavocytochrome.

120573,Cytochrome P450–redox partner fusion enzymes,2007,Andrew W Munro and Hazel M Girvan and Kirsty J McLean,1770,,3,345-359,Elsevier,The cytochromes P450 (P450s) are a broad class of heme b-containing mono-oxygenase enzymes. The vast majority of P450s catalyse reductive scission of molecular oxygen using electrons usually derived from coenzymes (NADH and NADPH) and delivered from redox partner proteins. Evolutionary advantages may be gained by fusion of one or more redox partners to the P450 enzyme in terms of e.g. catalytic efficiency. This route was taken by the well characterized flavocytochrome P450BM3 system (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium. in which soluble P450 and cytochrome P450 reductase enzymes are covalently linked to produce a highly efficient electron transport system for oxygenation of fatty acids and related molecules.

However. the molecular events that regulate p300 HAT activity are poorly understood. We evaluated autoacetylation of the p300 HAT protein domain to determine its function. Using expressed protein ligation. the p300 HAT protein domain was generated in hypoacetylated form and found to have reduced catalytic activity. This basal catalytic rate was stimulated by autoacetylation of several key lysine sites within an apparent activation loop motif. This post-translational modification and catalytic regulation of p300 HAT activity is conceptually analogous to the activation of most protein kinases by autophosphorylation. We therefore propose that this autoregulatory loop could influence the impact of p300 on a wide variety of signaling and transcriptional events.,True,ufdp8rgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,392,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb740,9816347601172795822,/scholar?cites=9816347601172795822,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dianzheng_Zhang/publication/6283593_Regulation_of_the_p300_HAT_domain_via_a_novel_activation_loop/links/0f3175323055260050000000/Regulation-of-the-p300-HAT-domain-via-a-novel-activation-loop.pdf,0,0,0

We found that threonine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) metabolism are coupled in pluripotent stem cells. resulting in regulation of histone methylation. Isotope labeling of mESCs revealed that threonine provides a substantial fraction of both the cellular glycine and the acetyl–coenzyme A (CoA) needed for SAM synthesis. Depletion of threonine from the culture medium or threonine dehydrogenase (Tdh) from mESCs decreased accumulation of SAM and decreased trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3). leading to slowed growth and increased differentiation.

It causes a broad range of illnesses. from symptomless infection through various respiratory syndromes. to fulminant primary viral and secondary bacterial pneumonia. and results in significant morbidity and mortality each year [1]. During infection. the highly contagious virus is easily transmitted by aerosol and can spread very quickly thereby causing the characteristic epidemics of the disease. Until now. only two classes of drugs are available for the treatment of influenza. One class belongs to the M2 blockers. such as amantadine and rimantadine. which are active exclusively against influenza A virus [2]. This kind of drug is of limited use due to a lack of activity against influenza B virus. side effects and rapid emergence of resistant virus strains during treatment [3]. The other class of drugs belong to the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors. which are effective on both influenza A and B viruses. NA inhibitors. such as zanamivir and oseltamivir. have less adverse effects. their usefulness in the clinical treatment of influenza has been reported [4]. Oseltamivir has been approved for use in the treatment of human influenza infection in many countries and can also be used for influenza prevention [5].

A Wiley Company,The focus of this essay is the phenomenon of haploinsufficiency (HI). a manifestation of genetic dominance that arises when only one allele of a normally diploid locus is present. Specifically. I examine the nature of HI for transcription factor genes. Although the concept of HI applies to many such genes. there is a potentially large variety of mechanisms that underlie it. Even when the phenomenon is linked in all cases to reduced absolute gene expression levels. there are several well‐documented cases where the explanation is not reduced expression per se but altered stoichiometry. I will discuss the notion of haploimbalance in general and evaluate the property of transcriptional synergy within the context of HI. This kind of non‐linear behaviour can probably explain a large proportion of the cases of HI. as well as the variability in most HI phenotypes and the fact that several factors in the same pathway may be …,True,juRyCc0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,279,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bies.10023,10354167082061824300,/scholar?cites=10354167082061824300,,,0,0,0

Although the C-terminal domain solution structure is similar to the X-ray crystal structure. the EF hands of the N-terminal domain are considerably less open. The substantial differences in interhelical angles correspond to negligible changes in short interproton distances and. therefore. cannot be identified by comparison of NOEs and X-ray data.

Live-cell imaging studies showed a close interaction of the CD3ɛ cytoplasmic domain of the T cell receptor (TCR) with the plasma membrane through fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a C-terminal fluorescent protein and a membrane fluorophore. Electrostatic interactions between basic CD3ɛ residues and acidic phospholipids enriched in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane were required for binding. The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the lipid-bound state of this cytoplasmic domain revealed deep insertion of the two key tyrosines into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. Receptor ligation thus needs to result in unbinding of the CD3ɛ ITAM from the membrane to render these tyrosines accessible to Src kinases …,True,XL1GnDYAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,390,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867408012373,7401576622328661327,/scholar?cites=7401576622328661327,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867408012373,0,0,0

We have solved the CARD structure of the RAIDD adaptor protein that recruits ICH-1/caspase-2. It consists of six tightly packed helices arranged in a topology homologous to the Fas death domain. The surface contains a basic and an acidic patch on opposite sides. This polarity is conserved in the ICH-1 CARD as indicated by homology modeling.

In most animals and plants that have been studied. centromeres contain megabase-scale arrays of tandem repeats. Despite their importance. very little is known about the degree to which centromere tandem repeats share common properties between different species across different phyla. We used bioinformatic methods to identify high-copy tandem repeats from 282 species using publicly available genomic sequence and our own data. Our methods are compatible with all current sequencing technologies. Long Pacific Biosciences sequence reads allowed us to find tandem repeat monomers up to 1.419 bp. We assumed that the most abundant tandem repeat is the centromere DNA. which was true for most species whose centromeres have been previously characterized. suggesting this is a general property of genomes. High-copy centromere tandem repeats were found in almost all animal and plant genomes. but repeat monomers were highly variable in sequence composition and length. Furthermore. phylogenetic analysis of sequence homology showed little evidence of sequence conservation beyond approximately 50 million years of divergence. We find that despite an overall lack of sequence conservation. centromere tandem repeats from diverse species showed similar modes of evolution. While centromere position in most eukaryotes is epigenetically determined. our results indicate that tandem repeats are highly prevalent at centromeres of both animal and plant genomes. This suggests a functional role for such repeats. perhaps in …,True,4KvzDY4AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,264,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2013-14-1-r10,4643344870051815303,/scholar?cites=4643344870051815303,,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2013-14-1-r10,0,0,0

We demonstrate that Rcf1 stably and independently associates with both Complex III and Complex IV of the electron transport chain.

120788,Aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis,2000,Michael Ibba and Dieter Söll,69,,1,617-650,Annual Reviews,Aminoacyl-tRNAs are substrates for translation and are pivotal in determining how the genetic code is interpreted as amino acids. The function of aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis is to precisely match amino acids with tRNAs containing the corresponding anticodon. This is primarily achieved by the direct attachment of an amino acid to the corresponding tRNA by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. although intrinsic proofreading and extrinsic editing are also essential in several cases. Recent studies of aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis. mainly prompted by the advent of whole genome sequencing and the availability of a vast body of structural data. have led to an expanded and more detailed picture of how aminoacyl-tRNAs are synthesized.

Despite a loose correlation between codon assignments and AARS evolutionary relationships. the code is far too highly structured to have been ordered merely through the evolutionary wanderings of these enzymes. Nevertheless. the AARSs are very informative about the evolutionary process. Examination of the phylogenetic trees for each of the AARSs reveals the following. (i) Their evolutionary relationships mostly conform to established organismal phylogeny: a strong distinction exists between bacterial- and archaeal-type AARSs. (ii) Although the evolutionary profiles of the individual AARSs might be expected to be similar in general respects. they are not.

The fidelity with which mRNA is translated during protein synthesis is determined by two factors: the availability of aminoacyl-tRNAs composed of cognate amino acid:tRNA pairs and the accurate selection of aminoacyl-tRNAs on the ribosome. The role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in translation is to define the genetic code by accurately pairing cognate tRNAs with their corresponding amino acids. Synthetases achieve the amino acid substrate specificity necessary to keep errors in translation to an acceptable level in two ways: preferential binding of the cognate amino acid and selective editing of near-cognate amino acids. Editing significantly decreases the frequency of errors and is important for translational quality control. and many details of the various editing mechanisms and their effect on different …,True,Ea7ExWgAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,325,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.micro.091208.073210,17596902853730322476,/scholar?cites=17596902853730322476,,,0,0,0
120791,Quality control mechanisms during translation,1999,Michael Ibba and Dieter Söll,286,,5446,1893-1897,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Translation uses the genetic information in messenger RNA (mRNA) to synthesize proteins. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are charged with an amino acid and brought to the ribosome. where they are paired with the corresponding trinucleotide codon in mRNA. The amino acid is attached to the nascent polypeptide and the ribosome moves on to the next codon. The cycle is then repeated to produce a full-length protein. Proofreading and editing processes are used throughout protein synthesis to ensure the faithful translation of genetic information. The maturation of tRNAs and mRNAs is monitored. as is the identity of amino acids attached to tRNAs. Accuracy is further enhanced during the selection of aminoacyl-tRNAs on the ribosome and their base pairing with mRNA.

Partial purification of the corresponding activity from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii indicated that tRNACys becomes acylated with O-phosphoserine (Sep) but not with cysteine. Further analyses identified a class II–type O-phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS) and Sep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase (SepCysS). SepRS specifically forms Sep-tRNACys. which is then converted to Cys-tRNACys by SepCysS.

Dysregulation of GSK-3 activity is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of CNS chronic disorders such as Alzheimer9s disease (AD). bipolar disorder. and Huntington9s disease. and of metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes. Accordingly. GSK-3 inhibitors have been postulated as therapeutic tools for these diseases. Interestingly. pathophysiological and pharmacological regulation of GSK-3 is affected by an amplification mechanism that applies both to inhibition and activation. The possibility therefore exists that sustained inhibition or activation might persist after cessation of the initial trigger. Regarding AD. GSK-3 has been shown to accumulate in pretangle neurons.

Tau phosphorylation by GSK3 regulates tau binding to microtubules. tau degradation and tau aggregation. Tau phosphorylation is important in Alzheimer disease pathology and in other tauopathies. In Alzheimer disease. it has been proposed that the peptide beta amyloid promotes GSK3 activation. resulting in tau phosphorylation. In this work. we review the links between beta amyloid peptide. tau protein and GSK3 that occur in familial Alzheimer disease.

However. the mechanisms by which energy deprivation and oxidative stress trigger autophagy remain undefined. Here. we report that activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) is required for autophagy in cultured endothelial cells. AMPK activity. ROS levels. and the markers of autophagy were monitored in confluent bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) treated with the glycolysis blocker 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). Treatment of BAEC with 2-DG (5 mM) for 24 hours or with low concentrations of H2O2 (100 µM) induced autophagy. including increased conversion of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II. accumulation of GFP-tagged LC3 positive intracellular vacuoles. and increased fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. 2-DG-treatment also induced AMPK phosphorylation. which was blocked by either co-administration of two potent anti-oxidants (Tempol and N-Acetyl-L-cysteine) or overexpression of superoxide dismutase 1 or catalase in BAEC. Further. 2-DG-induced autophagy in BAEC was blocked by overexpressing catalase or siRNA-mediated knockdown of AMPK. Finally. pretreatment of BAEC with 2-DG increased endothelial cell viability after exposure to hypoxic stress. Thus.

Whether AMPK is required for the protective effects of berberine in cardiovascular diseases remains unknown. This study was designed to determine whether AMPK is required for berberine-induced reduction of oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in vivo.   Methods ApoE (ApoE-/-) mice and ApoE-/-/AMPK alpha 2-/- mice that were fed Western diets were treated with berberine for 8 weeks. Atherosclerotic aortic lesions. expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). and markers of oxidative stress were evaluated in isolated aortas.   Results In ApoE-/- mice. chronic administration of berberine significantly reduced aortic lesions. markedly reduced oxidative stress and expression of adhesion molecules in aorta. and significantly increased UCP2 levels. In contrast. in ApoE-/-/AMPK alpha 2-/- mice. berberine had little effect on those endpoints. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). berberine significantly increased UCP2 mRNA and protein expression in an AMPK-dependent manner. Transfection of HUVECs with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1)-specific siRNA attenuated berberine-induced expression of UCP2. whereas transfection with control siRNA did not. Finally. berberine promoted mitochondrial biogenesis that contributed to up-regulation of UCP2 expression.   Conclusion We conclude that berberine reduces oxidative stress and vascular inflammation. and suppresses atherogenesis via a mechanism that includes stimulation of AMPK-dependent UCP2 expression.,True,uh6dok0AAAAJ:uENYxwZKF5gC,124,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025436,12050737707139486550,/scholar?cites=12050737707139486550,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025436,0,0,0

We also evaluated a number of issues that are relevant to the question of whether diacylglycerol (DAG)-dependent PKCs or DAG-insensitive PKCs. such as PKC-ζ. are more likely to play a role in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in L6 myotubes and other insulin-sensitive cell types. We found that insulin increased the enzyme activity of immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ in L6 myotubes. and this effect was blocked by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. wortmannin and LY294002; this suggested that PKC-ζ operates downstream of PI 3-kinase during insulin action.

However. since the ratio of rf field strength. ωrf/2π. to spinning frequency. ωr/2π. is lower. it is possible to operate the sequence at higher spinning rates. and we have investigated the 2QF efficiency as a function of 1H decoupling field strength at high spinning frequencies.

To what extent endocytosis is subjected to high-order regulation by the cellular signalling machinery remains unclear. Using high-throughput RNA interference and automated image analysis. we explored the function of human kinases in two principal types of endocytosis: clathrin-and caveolae/raft-mediated endocytosis. We monitored this through infection of vesicular stomatitis virus. simian virus 40 and transferrin trafficking. and also through cell proliferation and apoptosis assays.

Deformations are achieved both by forces extrinsic to the membrane as well as by structural modifications in the bilayer or at the bilayer surface that favor the acquisition of curvature. We report here that a family of proteins previously implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton also have powerful lipid bilayer-deforming properties via an N-terminal module (F-BAR) similar to the BAR domain. Several such proteins. like a subset of BAR domain proteins. bind to dynamin. a GTPase implicated in endocytosis and actin dynamics. via SH3 domains. The ability of BAR and F-BAR domain proteins to induce tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane is enhanced by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and is antagonized by dynamin.

Lipids are oxidized by three distinct mechanisms; enzymatic oxidation. non-enzymatic. free radical-mediated oxidation. and non-enzymatic. non-radical oxidation. Each oxidation mechanism yields specific products. The oxidation of linoleates and cholesterol is discussed in some detail. The relative susceptibilities of lipids to oxidation depend on the reaction milieu as well as their inherent structure. Lipid hydroperoxides are formed as the major primary products. however they are substrates for various enzymes and they also undergo various secondary reactions.

To test this. we artificially induced sperm DNA damage by irradiation with x‐ or gamma rays (doses of 0–300 Gy). Remarkably. sperm cells survived the irradiation quite well and. when compared with nonirradiated cells. sperm motility and integrity of plasma membrane. acrosome. and mitochondria were not altered by this irradiation treatment.

Of course. because a single stallion usually mates many mares. stallion fertility is a critical factor in the overall success of a breeding program. Unfortunately. accurate evaluation of stallion fertility per se requires a large number of normal mares to be mated and is necessarily retrospective. Rather. the ideal is to predict fertility in advance of the stallion's breeding career. and this is currently attempted by way of a thorough physical examination and a routine analysis of semen quality. However. while such a ‘breeding soundness examination’ identifies stallions that clearly lack the capacity for adequate fertility. it is of limited use for predicting the level of fertility and fails to identify some seriously sub‐fertile animals.

In addition to the demonstrated roles for caveolae in potocytosis and transcytosis. caveolae may regulate the transduction of signals from the plasma membrane. Transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by various oncogenes leads to reductions in cellular levels of caveolin. a principal component of the protein coat of caveolae. The reduction in caveolin correlates very well with the size of colonies formed by these transformed cells when grown in soft agar.

120990,Differential expression of five sialyltransferase genes in human tissues.,1994,Hiroshi Kitagawa and James C Paulson,269,Journal of Biological Chemistry,27,17872-17878,Elsevier,Cell type-specific expression of specific carbohydrate structures on cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids is increasingly recognized for providing information relevant to cell-cell interactions in developing and adult organisms. Sialyltransferases contribute to the diversity in carbohydrate structure through their attachment of sialic acid in various terminal positions on glycolipid and on glycoprotein (N-linked and O-linked) carbohydrate groups. In this report. differential expression of five sialyltransferase genes in human tissues is evaluated as a potential mechanism to account for cell type-specific variation in terminal sialoside structures produced by a cell. For this analysis. the complete cDNA of the human Gal beta 1.3GalNAc alpha 2.3-sialyltransferase and a partial cDNA of the developmentally regulated STX gene were cloned.

We found that a developmental increase in the 4-sulfation/6-sulfation (4S/6S) ratio of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). which are components of the brain extracellular matrix. leads to the termination of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity in the mouse visual cortex. Condensation of CSPGs into perineuronal nets that enwrapped synaptic contacts on parvalbumin-expressing interneurons was prevented by cell-autonomous overexpression of chondroitin 6-sulfation. which maintains a low 4S/6S ratio.

These effectors are defined by a conserved motif. termed RXLR (for Arg. any amino acid. Leu. Arg). that is located downstream of the signal peptide and that has been implicated in host translocation. Because the phenotypes of RXLR effectors extend to plant cells. their genes are expected to be the direct target of the evolutionary forces that drive the antagonistic interplay between pathogen and host.

This was correlated with the induction of immediate early genes in separate groups of animals given identical stimulus regimes. Following 10 trains of stimulation. long-term potentiation decayed with a time constant of up to several days (long-term potentiation 2). and this correlated with the appearance of an increase in the messenger RNA and protein levels of zif/268. Increasing the number of stimulus trains resulted in a greater probability of eliciting long-term potentiation with a time constant of several weeks (long-term potentiation 3). as well as increasing the induction of zif/268. c-Jun.

Priming of LTP was elicited by either pharmacological or synaptic activation of mGluRs before a weak tetanic stimulus that normally produced only a rapidly decaying phase of LTP that did not involve protein synthesis or mGluRs. Pharmacological priming of LTP persistence by a selective group I mGluR agonist was blocked by an inhibitor of group I mGluRs and by inhibitors of translation. but not by a transcriptional inhibitor.

The structure shows parkin in an autoinhibited state and provides insight into how it is activated. RING0 occludes the ubiquitin acceptor site Cys431 in RING2. whereas a repressor element of parkin binds RING1 and blocks its E2-binding site.

In the secretory pathway the folding status of glycoproteins passing through the endoplasmic reticulum is marked by the composition of the N-glycan. The different glycoforms are recognized by specialized lectins. The folding sensor UGGT acts as an unusual molecular chaperone and covalently modifies the Man9 N-glycan of a misfolded protein by adding a glucose moiety and converts it to Glc1Man9 that rebinds the lectin calnexin. However. further links between the folding status of a glycoprotein and the composition of the N-glycan are unclear.

Two types of desaturases have been identified. one soluble and the other membrane-bound. that have different consensus motifs. Database searching for these motifs reveals that these enzymes belong to two distinct multifunctional classes. each of which includes desaturases. hydroxylases. and epoxidases that act on fatty acids or other substrates. The soluble class has a consensus motif consisting of carboxylates and histidines that coordinate an active site diiron cluster. The integral membrane class contains a different consensus motif composed of histidines.

121103,A nonlinear criterion for triaxial strength of inherently anisotropic rocks,2015,Mahendra Singh and NK Samadhiya and Ajit Kumar and Vivek Kumar and Bhawani Singh,48,Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering,4,1387-1405,Springer Vienna,Rocks encountered at many underground construction sites are laminated and exhibit direction-dependent strength behavior. It is also a well-established fact that the strength varies in a nonlinear manner with confining pressure. There is a need of strength criterion which could capture the nonlinearity as well as the anisotropy in the triaxial strength behavior of the rocks. It is essential that the criterion should be simple and must involve minimum testing to the extent possible. Further. the parameters of the criterion should have wide acceptability among the geotechnical fraternity. In the present study. a nonlinear strength criterion for transversely isotropic rocks is presented. Critical state concept Barton (Int J Rock Mech Mining Sci Geomech Abstr 13(9):255–279. 1976) has been used to define the curvature of the criterion.

Ltd.,Conservative formulations of the governing laws of elastoplastic solid media have distinct advantages when solved using high‐order shock capturing methods for simulating processes involving large deformations and shock waves. In this paper one such model is considered where inelastic deformations are accounted for via conservation laws for elastic strain with relaxation source terms. Plastic deformations are governed by the relaxation time of tangential stresses. Compared with alternative Eulerian conservative models. the governing system consists of fewer equations overall. A numerical scheme for the inhomogeneous system is proposed based upon the temporal splitting. In this way the reduced system of non‐linear elasticity is solved explicitly. with convective fluxes evaluated using high‐order approximations of Riemann problems locally throughout the computational mesh.

Here we show that CD28 costimulation. acting through phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) and Akt. is required for T cells to increase their glycolytic rate in response to activation. Furthermore. CD28 controls a primary response pathway. inducing a level of glucose uptake and glycolysis in excess of that needed to maintain cellular ATP/ADP levels or macromolecular synthesis.

Akt coordinately regulates these fundamental cellular processes through phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of tumor suppressors and activation of trophic signaling. Akt signaling stimulates transport and metabolism of both glucose and amino acids. which in turn support mTOR-dependent increases in protein translation. In addition. Akt activation directs cells to undertake a metabolic conversion from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis.

The protein was distributed throughout the fibril fragments but was antigenically masked due to the tight packing of collagen molecules and could be identified only at sites where the fibril structure was partially disrupted. Collagens II and IX were also distributed uniformly along fibrils but. in contrast to collagen XI. were accessible to the antibodies in intact fibrils. Therefore. cartilage fibrils are heterotypically assembled from collagens II. IX. and XI.

The partially refolded protein was then used as a model system for testing proteolytic enzymes as probes for quantitative assay of fully aligned triple-helical molecules. Pepsin and chymotrypsin both digested fully denatured procollagen. However. digestion times of greater than 60 min were required. even with a large molar excess of the proteinases. These enzymes therefore are only useful for examining the folding of procollagen under conditions in which the process occurs at a slow rate. In contrast. trypsin cleaved the collagen domain of denatured procollagen within 2 min.

Collagen II and XI belong to the subgroup of fibrillar collagens and are structurally closely related. differing mainly in their N‐propeptides. Collagen IX has a very different structure but is nevertheless an essential constituent of the striated fibrils. Two other collagen types are also found in cartilage but form distinct structures. Collagen VI. found mainly in the periphery of the chondrocytes. forms beaded filaments. These filaments are probably formed by interaction of collagen VI with hyaluronan.

Widespread MPT has catastrophic consequences for the cell. de facto marking the boundary between cellular life and death.

Elevation in intracellular Ca2+ concentration is dependent either on Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space through the plasma membrane. or on Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. such as the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR). Mitochondria are also major components of calcium signalling. capable of modulating both the amplitude and the spatio-temporal patterns of Ca2+ signals. Recent studies revealed zones of close contact between the ER and mitochondria called MAMs (Mitochondria Associated Membranes) crucial for a correct communication between the two organelles. including the selective transmission of physiological and pathological Ca2+ signals from the ER to mitochondria.

In support of this view. a large body of experimental evidence has unambiguously revealed that. in addition to the well-established function of producing most of the cellular ATP. mitochondria play a fundamental role in triggering apoptotic cell death.Various apoptotic stimuli cause the release of specific mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factors into the cytosol. The molecular mechanism of this release is still controversial. but there is no doubt that mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) overload is one of the pro-apoptotic ways to induce the swelling of mitochondria. with perturbation or rupture of the outer membrane. and in turn the release of mitochondrial apoptotic factors into the cytosol.Here. we review as different proteins that participate in mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and in turn modulate the effectiveness of Ca2+-dependent apoptotic stimuli.

ECM provides the bulk. shape and strength of many tissues in vivo. such as basement membrane. bone and cartilage. In vitro. most animal cells can only grow when they are attached to surfaces through ECM. ECM is also the substrate for cell migration. However. ECM provides much more than just mechanical and structural support. with implications in developmental patterning. stem cell niches and cancer. ECM imparts spatial context for signalling events by various cell surface growth factor receptors and adhesion molecules such as integrins. The external physical properties of ECM may also have a role in the signalling process. ECM molecules can be flexible and extendable. and mechanical tension can expose cryptic sites. which could further interact with growth factors or their receptors. ECM proteins and structures can determine the cell behaviour. polarity. migration. differentiation. proliferation and survival by communicating with the intracellular cytoskeleton and transmission of growth factor signals. Integrins and proteoglycans are the major ECM adhesion receptors which cooperate in signalling events. determining the signalling outcomes. and thus the cell fate.

Expression of the hamster HMGR gene led to a 3- to 6-fold increase in the total HMGR enzyme activity. Total sterol accumulation was consequently increased 3- to 10-fold. whereas end-product sterols such as sitosterol. campesterol. and …,True,OXQvPOgAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,358,http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/109/4/1337.short,4336710262211461609,/scholar?cites=4336710262211461609,,http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/plantphysiol/109/4/1337.full.pdf,0,0,0

Two independent cDNA clones (cEAS1 and cEAS2) encoding EAS were isolated from an elicitor-induced tobacco cDNA library by differential hybridization and subsequently were characterized by hybrid selection--in vitro translation. Insertion of cEAS1. a partial cDNA clone encoding 175 C-terminal amino acids. into an Escherichia coli expression vector resulted in accumulation of a fusion protein immunodetectable with EAS-specific polyclonal antibodies. The cDNA clones were used to isolate two full-length EAS genes that mapped 5 kilobases (kb) apart on one 15-kb genomic clone.

This mutant strain. designated ca-1-12-1C (gene locus ca-1). was selected on the basis of a high CO2 requirement for photoautotrophic growth. Photosynthesis by the mutant at atmospheric CO2 concentration was very much reduced compared to wild type and. unlike wild type. was strongly inhibited by O2. In contrast to a CO2 compensation concentration of near zero in wild type at all O2 concentrations examined. the mutant exhibited a high. O2-stimulated CO2 compensation concentration. Evidence of photorespiratory activity in the mutant but not in wild type was obtained from the analysis of photosynthetic products in the presence of 14CO2.

Homer and Shank are among the most abundant scaffolding proteins in the PSD. working synergistically for maturation of dendritic spines. Here. we demonstrate that Homer and Shank. together. form a mesh-like matrix structure. Crystallographic analysis of this region revealed a pair of parallel dimeric coiled coils intercalated in a tail-to-tail fashion to form a tetramer. giving rise to the unique configuration of a pair of N-terminal EVH1 domains at each end of the coiled coil.

ORC recognizes specific origin DNA sequences in an ATP-dependent manner. Here we demonstrate cooperative binding of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc6 to ORC on DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. which induces a change in the pattern of origin binding that requires the Orc1 ATPase. The reaction is blocked by specific origin mutations that do not interfere with the interaction between ORC and DNA. Single-particle reconstruction of electron microscopic images shows that the ORC–Cdc6 complex forms a ring-shaped structure with dimensions similar to those of the ring-shaped MCM helicase.

However. building such structures via self-assembly has proven to be challenging because of the low packing fraction. sensitivity to bond orientation. and local heterogeneity. We report a strategy for creating a diamond superlattice of nano-objects via self-assembly and demonstrate its experimental realization by assembling two variant diamond lattices. one with and one without atomic analogs. Our approach relies on the association between anisotropic particles with well-defined tetravalent binding topology and isotropic particles. The constrained packing of triangular binding footprints of truncated tetrahedra on a sphere defines a unique three-dimensional lattice.

Approximately a five-fold larger amount of carotenoids was found in the human macula (35-120 ng) than in previously reported work. The dominant carotenoids in the whole retina are lutein and zeaxanthin. Zeaxanthin is concentrated in the macular region. whereas lutein is dispersed throughout the entire retina. Contrary to prior reports. substantial quantities of both carotenoids are present in the infant retina. Increasing variability is observed in carotenoid levels between individuals with advancing age. and some older individuals show very high whole retina carotenoid levels. These quantitative studies were made possible by synthesis of a new. stable carotenoid internal standard.

Here. we show that mammalian Sir2α physically interacts with p53 and attenuates p53-mediated functions. Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3) inhibits an NAD-dependent p53 deacetylation induced by Sir2α. and also enhances the p53 acetylation levels in vivo. Furthermore. Sir2α represses p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage and oxidative stress. whereas expression of a Sir2α point mutant increases the sensitivity of cells in the stress response.

However. the molecular mechanisms that govern the choice between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis are not well understood. Here. we show that Tip60 is required for both cell growth arrest and apoptosis mediated by p53 and also induces its acetylation specifically at lysine 120 (K120) within the DNA-binding domain. Interestingly. this modification is crucial for p53-dependent apoptosis but is dispensable for its mediated growth arrest. K120 is a recurrent site for p53 mutation in human cancer. and the corresponding acetylation-defective tumor mutant (K120R) abrogates p53-mediated apoptosis. but not growth arrest.

Here we show that the mechanism by which the loss of HIC1 function promotes tumorigenesis is via activating the stress-controlling protein SIRT1 and thereby attenuating p53 function. HIC1 forms a transcriptional repression complex with SIRT1 deacetylase. and this complex directly binds the SIRT1 promoter and represses its transcription. Inactivation of HIC1 results in upregulated SIRT1 expression in normal or cancer cells; this deacetylates and inactivates p53. allowing cells to bypass apoptosis and survive DNA damage. Inhibition of SIRT1 function in cells without HIC1 abolishes the resistance to apoptosis.

The co-activatory role of PML depends on its ability to localize in the PML-NB. p53-dependent.

Mdm2 expression can significantly enhance the in vivo association between p53 and HIF-1α. indicating that Mdm2 may act as a bridge and mediate the indirect interaction between HIF-1α and p53 in cells.

Furthermore we demonstrate that (1) well‐defined metabolic differences exist in all examined compartments between the metabotypes of GF and conventional mice: bacterial co‐metabolic products such as hippurate (urine) and 5‐aminovalerate (colon epithelium) were found at reduced concentrations. whereas raffinose was only detected in GF colonic profiles.

Using the yeast two-hybrid system. we screened a mouse brain cDNA library with bait constructs for mouse IP3R type 1 (IP3R1) to identify IP3R1-associated proteins. In this way. we found that carbonic anhydrase-related protein (CARP) is a novel IP3R1-binding protein. Western blot analysis revealed that CARP is expressed exclusively in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. in which IP3R1 is abundantly expressed. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the subcellular localization of CARP in Purkinje cells is coincident with that of IP3R1.

Heterozygous knockout of brain-dominant type1 IP3R (IP3R1) resulted in neuronal vulnerability to ER stress in vivo. and IP3R1 knockdown enhanced ER stress-induced apoptosis via mitochondria in cultured cells. The IP3R1 tetrameric assembly was positively regulated by the ER chaperone GRP78 in an energy-dependent manner.

While neuronal spiking activity in the SCN provides a functional circadian oscillator that propagates throughout the brain. the ultradian sleep–wake state is regulated by the basal forebrain/preoptic area (BF/POA). How this SCN circadian oscillation is integrated into the shorter sleep–wake cycles remains unclear. We examined the temporal patterns of neuronal activity in these key brain regions in freely behaving rats. Neuronal activity in various brain regions presented diurnal rhythmicity and/or sleep–wake state dependence.

As these ion channels have not yet been isolated and characterized. it has not been possible to determine whether phosphorylation of the ion channels themselves alters their properties or whether some indirect mechanism is involved.

121345,Soluble proteins of chemical communication: an overview across arthropods,2014,Paolo Pelosi and Immacolata Iovinella and Antonio Felicioli and Francesca R Dani,5,,,320,Frontiers,Detection of chemical signals both in insects and in vertebrates is mediated by soluble proteins. highly concentrated in olfactory organs. which bind semiochemicals and activate. with still largely unknown mechanisms. specific chemoreceptors. The same proteins are often found in structures where pheromones are synthesised and released. where they likely perform a second role in solubilising and delivering chemical messengers in the environment. A single class of soluble polypeptides. called Odorant-Binding Proteins (OBPs) is known in vertebrates. while two have been identified in insects. OBPs and CSPs (Chemosensory Proteins). Despite their common name. OBPs of vertebrates bear no structural similarity with those of insects. We observed that in arthropods OBPs are strictly limited to insects. while a few members of the CSP family have been found in crustacean and other arthropods. where however. based on their very limited numbers. a function in chemical communication seems unlikely. The question we address in this review is whether another class of soluble proteins may have been adopted by other arthropods to perform the role of OBPs and CSPs in insects.

Here we show in mouse that PGC1-α expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of FNDC5. a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a newly identified hormone. irisin. Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to stimulate UCP1 expression and a broad program of brown-fat-like development. Irisin is induced with exercise in mice and humans. and mildly increased irisin levels in the blood cause an increase in energy expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake.

This unusual electron-transfer pathway leads to an accentuated increase of the KMapp value (102 mM) and hence to a significantly increased linear detection range of an ethanol sensor based on this enzyme. ,True,KKba8vQAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC,183,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac981201c,11987401143902392808,/scholar?cites=11987401143902392808,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45428163/Polypyrrole-Entrapped_Quinohemoprotein_A20160507-28189-1uw3rm8.pdf,0,0,0

PTEN is a phosphatase that can act on both polypeptide and phosphoinositide substrates in vitro. The PTEN structure reveals a phosphatase domain that is similar to protein phosphatases but has an enlarged active site important for the accommodation of the phosphoinositide substrate. The structure also reveals that PTEN has a C2 domain. The PTEN C2 domain binds phospholipid membranes in vitro. and mutation of basic residues that could mediate this reduces PTEN's membrane affinity and its ability to suppress the growth of glioblastoma tumor cells.

Although TLRs are clearly involved in the detection of bacteria and viruses. relatively little is known about their function in the innate response to eukaryotic microorganisms. Here we identify a profilin-like molecule from the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii that generates a potent interleukin-12 (IL-12) response in murine DCs that is dependent on myeloid differentiation factor 88. T. gondii profilin activates DCs through TLR11 and is the first chemically defined ligand for this TLR. Moreover.

Among the many PcG proteins known in Drosophila. Pho is the only sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. To gain insight into the function of Pho. we purified Pho protein complexes from Drosophila embryos and found that Pho exists in two distinct protein assemblies: a Pho–dINO80 complex containing the Drosophila INO80 nucleosome-remodeling complex. and a Pho-repressive complex (PhoRC) containing the uncharacterized gene product dSfmbt. Analysis of PhoRC reveals that dSfmbt is a novel PcG protein that is essential for HOX gene repression in Drosophila.

An integral component employed by cells to counter toxic protein aggregates is the conserved ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS). Previous studies have described an age-dependent decline of proteasomal function and increased longevity correlates with sustained proteasome capacity in centenarians and in naked mole rats. a long-lived rodent. Proof for a direct impact of enhanced proteasome function on longevity. however. is still lacking. To determine the importance of proteasome function in yeast aging. we established a method to modulate UPS capacity by manipulating levels of the UPS–related transcription factor Rpn4. While cells lacking RPN4 exhibit a decreased non-adaptable proteasome pool. loss of UBR2. an ubiquitin ligase that regulates Rpn4 turnover. results in elevated Rpn4 levels. which upregulates UPS components. Increased UPS capacity significantly enhances replicative lifespan (RLS) and resistance to proteotoxic stress. while reduced UPS capacity has opposing consequences. Despite tight transcriptional co-regulation of the UPS and oxidative detoxification systems. the impact of proteasome capacity on lifespan is independent of the latter. since elimination of Yap1. a key regulator of the oxidative stress response. does not affect lifespan extension of cells with higher proteasome capacity.

The inherited form of the disease. familial ALS. represents 5–10% of the total cases. and the best documented of these are due to lesions in SOD1. the gene encoding copper–zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD). The mechanism by which mutations in SOD1 cause familial ALS is currently unknown. Two hypotheses have dominated recent discussion of the toxicity of ALS mutant CuZnSOD proteins: the oligomerization hypothesis and the oxidative damage hypothesis. The oligomerization hypothesis maintains that mutant CuZnSOD proteins are. or become. misfolded and consequently oligomerize into increasingly high-molecular-weight species that ultimately lead to the death of motor neurons.

Assembly of this major constituent of the bacterial cell wall is a multistep process starting in the cytoplasm and ending in the exterior cell surface. The intracellular part of the pathway results in the production of the membrane‐anchored cell wall precursor. Lipid II. After synthesis this lipid intermediate is translocated across the cell membrane. The translocation (flipping) step of Lipid II was demonstrated to require a specific protein (flippase).

The system is also capable of secreting heterologous proteins. but with generally low efficiency. We have increased the efficiency of secretion of the system by using signal peptides of insect origin to direct the secretion of a foreign protein. The precursor of the plant cysteine protease papain (propapain) has been used as a report enzyme to compare secretion efficiency.

This latter capacity to remove C-terminal dipeptides has been attributed to the presence of a 20-residue insertion. termed the occluding loop. that blocks the primed terminus of the active site cleft. Variants of human procathepsin B. where all or part of this element was deleted. were expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. A mutant. where the 12 central residues of the occluding loop were deleted. autoprocessed. albeit more slowly than the wild type proenzyme. to yield a mature form of the enzyme with endopeptidase activity comparable with the wild-type cathepsin B. but totally lacking exopeptidase activity.

For efficient budding. a full amino terminus of VP40 is required. which includes a PPXY and a PT/SAP motif. both of which have been proposed to interact with cellular proteins. Here. we report that Ebola VP40 can interact with cellular factors human Nedd4 and Tsg101 in vitro. We show that WW domain 3 of human Nedd4 is necessary and sufficient for binding to the PPXY motif of VP40. which requires an oligomeric conformation of VP40.

The condition leads to severe economic consequences and is reaching pandemic level globally. Much research is being carried out to address this disease and its underlying molecular mechanism. This review focuses on the diverse role and mechanism of ceramide. a prime sphingolipid signaling molecule. in the pathogenesis of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and its complications. Studies using cultured cells. animal models. and human subjects demonstrate that ceramide is a key player in the induction of β-cell apoptosis. insulin resistance. and reduction of insulin gene expression.

Here we present an approach to understand electrophysiological diversity through gene expression by integrating pooled- and single-cell transcriptomics with intracellular electrophysiology. Using neuroinformatics methods. we compiled a brain-wide dataset of 34 neuron types with paired gene expression and intrinsic electrophysiological features from publically accessible sources. the largest such collection to date. We identified 420 genes whose expression levels significantly correlated with variability in one or more of 11 physiological parameters. We next trained statistical models to infer cellular features from multivariate gene expression patterns. Such models were predictive of gene-electrophysiological relationships in an independent collection of 12 visual cortex cell types from the Allen Institute. suggesting that these correlations might reflect general principles relating expression patterns to phenotypic diversity across very different cell types. Many associations reported here have the potential to provide new insights into how neurons generate functional diversity. and correlations of ion channel genes like Gabrd and Scn1a (Nav1.1) with resting potential and spiking frequency are consistent with known causal mechanisms.

Prx have been described to be strictly dependent on thiols. but here. we show that ascorbate (vitamin C) also reduces 1-Cys Prx. but not 2-Cys Prx. from several taxonomic groups. Reduction by ascorbate is partly related to the fact that the oxidized form of 1-Cys Prx is a stable sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) instead of a disulfide. In addition. a histidine residue in the active site is required. In fact. we engineered a 2-Cys Prx with these two features. and it displayed ascorbate peroxidase activity. These data represent a breakthrough in the thiol-specific antioxidant paradigm. Ascorbate may be the long-sought-after biological reductant of 1-Cys Prx.

In bioassays with freshwater fish. acute toxicity appears to be derived exclusively from the Ag+ ion concentration of the water. Some other forms of silver are bioavailable but do not show obvious contribution to acute toxicity.

For freshwater fish. the acute toxicity of Ag appears to be caused solely by ionic Ag+ interacting at the gills. inhibiting basolateral Na+. K+‐ATPase activity. Disruption of this enzyme inhibits active Na+ and Cl− uptake and therefore osmoregulation by the fish. Silver is much less toxic to marine fish. mainly because ionic Ag+ is complexed by Cl−. but the mechanisms of acute toxicity and the toxic species of Ag are poorly understood.

Because of low solubility of AgCl(s). bioassays for AgCln were performed in two separate ways. In one test series. AgCl(s) was added to freshwater and in another. AgCln(aq) was generated by adding AgNO3 to freshwater supplemented with 50 mM NaCl. Concentrations of Ag and metallothionein (MT) were analyzed in gills and livers offish that survived the exposures. Although Ag added as AgNO3 was found to be highly toxic to rainbow trout (168‐h LC50 = 9.1 μg Ag L−1). the toxicities of the other Ag salts were low. The 168‐h LC50 for Ag(S2O3)n was 137.000 μg Ag L−1 and no mortality was observed in AgCln (100.000 μg Ag L−1). Exposure to AgNO3.

An unexposed group held under identical conditions served as control. The presence of Zn2+ in the water increased the apparent Km for Ca2+ influx by up to 300% with only a small inhibitory effect (35% at most) on the maximum rate of uptake (Jmax). These results. in combination with earlier data showing that Ca2+ competitively inhibits Zn2+ uptake. suggest that Zn2+ and Ca2+ compete for the same uptake sites. Acute withdrawal of Zn2+ after 3h of exposure resulted in a 23-fold reduction in Km for Ca2+. but a persistent small depression of Jmax. During prolonged exposure to Zn2+. the apparent Km for Ca2+ remained greatly elevated and Jmax remained slightly depressed …,True,Z0_7vD0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,192,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/186/1/55.short,10928933582840811017,/scholar?cites=10928933582840811017,,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/186/1/55.full.pdf,0,0,0

Involvement of the apical Ca2+ uptake sites in Zn2+ uptake was examined in vivo by pharmacological manipulation of the apical Ca2+ permeability. The apical entries of Ca2+ and Zn2+. but not Na2+ and Cl-. were inhibited by addition of La to the water.

The inner layer of the wall is largely responsible for the mechanical strength of the wall and also provides the attachment sites for the proteins that form the outer layer of the wall. Here we find among others the sexual agglutinins and the flocculins. The outer protein layer also limits the permeability of the cell wall. thus shielding the plasma membrane from attack by foreign enzymes and membrane-perturbing compounds. The main features of the molecular organization of the yeast cell wall are now known. Importantly. the molecular composition and organization of the cell wall may vary considerably. For example. the incorporation of many cell wall proteins is temporally and spatially controlled and depends strongly on environmental conditions.

Several cell wall mutants displayed enhanced FKS2–lacZ expression. a known output of Slt2 activation. A similar response was obtained with wild-type cells grown in the presence of the cell wall perturbants Calcofluor white and Zymolyase. Upregulation of FKS2–lacZ in response to sublethal concentrations of these agents fully depended on the presence of Slt2. The same cell wall stress conditions resulted in dual threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation of Slt2.

Single cell ablation was achieved by delivering mid-IR laser pulses through the etched tip of a GeO2-based glass fiber. Metabolic analysis was performed from single cells and small cell populations of Allium cepa and Narcissus pseudonarcissus bulb epidermis. as well as single eggs of Lytechinus pictus. Of the 332 peaks detected for A. cepa. 35 were assigned to metabolites with the help of accurate ion masses and tandem MS. The metabolic profiles from single cells of the two plant species included a large variety of oligosaccharides including possibly fructans in A. cepa. and alkaloids. e.g …,True,Ub9Xcy8AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,231,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac901525g,15985643726892091933,/scholar?cites=15985643726892091933,,https://vertes.columbian.gwu.edu/publications/Shrestha%202009.pdf,0,0,0

In all of the genomes studied. dinucleotide repeat stretches tended to be longer than other repeats.

Although the trends for different repeats are similar between different chromosomes within a genome. the density of repeats may vary between different chromosomes of the same species. The abundance or rarity of various di- and trinucleotide repeats in different genomes cannot be explained by nucleotide composition of a sequence or potential of repeated motifs to form alternative DNA structures.

Conserved residues of Im9 form a binding-energy hotspot through a combination of backbone hydrogen bonds to the endonuclease. many via buried solvent molecules. and hydrophobic interactions at the core of the interface. while the specificity-determining residues interact with …,True,2QHjep0AAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC,156,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283600939457,18228138160230494875,/scholar?cites=18228138160230494875,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42120198/Specificity_in_protein-protein_interacti20160204-27591-lhfnew.pdf,0,0,0

The most wide-spread class of cAMP-generating enzymes are the class III adenylyl cyclases. Most class III adenylyl cyclases are multi-domain proteins. The catalytic domains exclusively work as dimers. catalysis proceeds at the dimer interface. so that both monomers provide catalytic residues to each catalytic center. Inspection of amino acid sequence profiles suggests a division of the class III adenylyl cyclases in to four subclasses. class IIIa–IIId. Genome projects and postgenomic analysis have provided novel aspects in terms of catalysis and regulation. Alterations in the canonical catalytic residues occur in all four subclasses suggesting a plasticity of the catalytic mechanisms.

The limited catalytic efficiency of Rubisco has sparked extensive efforts to re-engineer the enzyme with the goal of enhancing agricultural productivity. To facilitate such efforts we analysed the formation of cyanobacterial form I Rubisco by in vitro reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy. We show that RbcL subunit folding by the GroEL/GroES chaperonin is tightly coupled with assembly mediated by the chaperone RbcX 2. RbcL monomers remain partially unstable and retain high affinity for GroEL until captured by RbcX 2. As revealed by the structure of a RbcL 8–(RbcX 2) 8 assembly intermediate. RbcX 2 acts as a molecular staple in stabilizing the RbcL subunits as dimers and facilitates RbcL 8 core assembly.

Here we present the crystal structure of a disk-shaped octameric form of VP40 formed by four antiparallel homodimers of the N-terminal domain. The octamer binds an RNA triribonucleotide containing the sequence 5′-U-G-A-3′ through its inner pore surface. and its oligomerization and RNA binding properties are facilitated by two conformational changes when compared to monomeric VP40. The selective RNA interaction stabilizes the ring structure and confers in vitro SDS resistance to octameric VP40. SDS-resistant octameric VP40 is also found in Ebola virus-infected cells. which suggests that VP40 has an additional function in the life cycle of the virus besides promoting virus assembly and budding off the plasma membrane.,True,MTG6VrEAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,168,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212603000509,11071080652588359946,/scholar?cites=11071080652588359946,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212603000509,0,0,0

Release of cTnT has been demonstrated in several small studies after endurance exercise. The purpose of this study was to explore. using a meta-analytic approach. the incidence of postexercise cTnT release after endurance exercise. METHODS: Articles identified via Pubmed. SportDiscus. and Embase (1997-2006) searches using the key words cardiac troponin T. cTnT. cardiac biomarkers. and exercise; a search of bibliographies; and consultation with experts in the field were entered into a random-effects meta-analysis. We identified 26 relevant studies (1120 cases). Age. gender. and body mass of participants. as well as exercise mode and duration. were explored as possible moderator variables with meta-regressions. RESULTS: Postexercise cTnT levels exceeded the assay detection limit in 47% of participants (95% CI= 39-56%). The detection of postexercise cTnT after cycling events was approximately half that of running events (27 vs 52%. P= 0.042). The detection of postexercise cTnT decreased slightly as event duration increased (P= 0.022) and mean body mass decreased (P= 0.0033). Postexercise detection of cTnT was not affected by age (P= 0.309) and was only slightly higher for studies with more males in the sample (P= 0.028).

Earlier studies suggested that the activation of Akt by PI3-K may be mediated by the binding of D3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides to the Akt pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. On the basis of these studies. it was hypothesized that Akt is a direct PI3-K target. To test this hypothesis. we reconstituted the pathway of Akt activation in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells.

Attempts to treat such tumors with EGFR antagonists have met with remarkable initial successes. particularly when EGFR antagonists were used in combination with chemotherapy or ionizing radiation. Considering the almost ubiquitous expression of the EGFR in normal epithelial tissues. these clinical trials also revealed a surprisingly low rate of adverse side effects associated with EGFR blockade.

Three enzymic digestions (one of a polypeptide and two of small proteins) are used to show that it is the hydrophilic peptides in a mixture that are suppressed. By determination of the FAB spectra of both pure hydrophilic and hydrophobic peptides. and of mixtures of these. it is shown that (i) hydrophilic peptides alone give a relatively poor signal response and (ii) hydrophilic peptides are further suppressed in the presence of hydrophobic peptides that initially occupy the surface of the matrix. A hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity index (AF values) can be used to indicate which peptide may be suppressed.

These methods of analysis allow analyte separations in aqueous solutions that are complementary to classical techniques such as HPLC and HPLC-MS. However. the one major limitation of CE is the fact that the best performance is normally obtained in analyzing small sample volumes (typically< 50 nL for a 50-micron-id capillary). Ultimately. this leads to a relatively poor concentration limit of detection (CLOD) for CE and CE-MS when compared to that of HPLC or HPLC-MS. Recently. the analyte concentrator and membrane preconcentration cartridge have been described for use on-line with the CE capillary. Common to many of the approaches that led to the development of these devices is the incorporation of a suitable stationary phase at the inlet of the CE capillary. This relatively simple modification permits the introduction of much larger sample volumes (> 100 microL) into the CE capillary. and lowers both the CE and CE-MS CLOD. Detection of analytes present in complex mixtures at concentrations of< 200 fg/mL is reported to be possible when using such techniques in conjunction with CE and CE-MS. Additionally. the analyte concentrator has been developed to analyze microreactions on-line with the CE capillary.

When fibroblasts are stimulated with PDGF. formation of peripheral ruffles precedes that of dorsal ruffles in lamellipodia.

To date. there is no direct evidence of a functional role in vivo for profilin in actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Here. we prepared a profilin mutant (H119E) defective in actin binding. but retaining the ability to bind to other proteins. This mutant profilin I suppresses actin polymerization in microspike formation induced by N‐WASP. the essential factor in microspike formation. Profilin associates both in vivo and in vitro with N‐WASP at proline‐rich sites different from those to which Ash/Grb2 binds.

Recently. effort has been directed at identifying the location and types of cross‐links that are found in collagen and elastin. There are two major groups of cross‐links: those initiated by the enzyme lysyl oxidase and those derived from nonenzymatically glycated lysine and hydroxylysine residues.

Procyanidin standards through decamers were obtained by extraction from cocoa beans. enrichment by Sephadex LH-20 gel permeation chromatography. and final purification by preparative normal-phase HPLC. The purity of each oligomeric fraction was assessed using HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry. A composite standard was then prepared. and calibration curves were generated for each oligomeric class using a quadratic fit of area sum versus concentration.

A hypothesis is proposed that links dietary copper levels to dynamic and proportional changes in lysyl oxidase activity in connective tissue. Although nutritional copper status does not influence the accumulation of lysyl oxidase as protein or lysyl oxidase steady state messenger RNA concentrations. the direct influence of dietary copper on the functional activity of lysyl oxidase is clear. The hypothesis is based on the possibility that copper efflux and lysyl oxidase secretion from cells may share a common pathway. The change in functional activity is most likely the result of posttranslational processing of lysyl oxidase.

A review of numerous nutrition surveys in underdeveloped countries enhanced the suspicion that deficiency of vitamin A does contribute to the prevalence of anemia. Preliminary studies of vitamin A-deficient rats confirmed previous observations that anemia may result from lack of this vitamin. The livers of these animals had very low concentrations of vitamin A but normal or increased concentrations of iron. The finding of anemia is in contrast with other reports that vitamin A deficiency may cause elevated values for hemoglobin and hematocrit.

However. d-serine action has not been previously compared with that of endogenous glycine. and the relative importance of the two coagonists remains unclear. We now investigated the efficiencies of the two coagonists in mediating NMDA receptor neurotoxicity in organotypic hippocampal slices. Removal of endogenous d-serine from slices was achieved by pretreating the tissue with recombinant d-serine deaminase enzyme. This enzyme is several orders of magnitude more efficient than previous methods to remove d-serine. We report that complete removal of d-serine virtually abolished NMDA-elicited neurotoxicity but did not protect against kainate.

A number of critical findings point to a central role for astrocytes in mediating MeHg-induced neurotoxicity as evidenced by the following observations: a) MeHg preferentially accumulates in astrocytes; b) MeHg specifically inhibits glutamate uptake in astrocytes; c) neuronal dysfunction is secondary to disturbances in astrocytes. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by MeHg has been observed in various experimental paradigms. For example. MeHg enhances ROS formation both in vivo (rodent cerebellum) and in vitro (isolated rat brain synaptosomes). as well as in neuronal and mixed reaggregating cell cultures. Antioxidants. including selenocompounds. can rescue astrocytes from MeHg-induced cytotoxicity by reducing ROS formation. We emphasize that oxidative stress plays a significant role in mediating MeHg-induced neurotoxic damage with active involvement of the mitochondria in this process.

[2]. [3]. [4]. It was recently demonstrated that long-term treatment with rapamycin. an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway[5]. or ablation of the mTOR target p70S6K[6] extends lifespan in mice. possibly by delaying aging. Whether inhibition of the mTOR pathway would delay or prevent age-associated disease such as AD remained to be determined.  Methodology/Principal Findings We used rapamycin administration and behavioral tools in a mouse model of AD as well as standard biochemical and immunohistochemical measures in brain tissue to provide answers for this question. Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Aβ42. a major toxic species in AD[7]. in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model. These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can reduce Aβ42 levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice. As expected from the inhibition of mTOR. autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic. but not in non-transgenic. PDAPP mice. suggesting that the reduction in Aβ and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy. possibly as a response to high levels of Aβ.  Conclusions/Significance Our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin. an intervention that extends lifespan in mice. can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease.

This view has broadened significantly with the recent discoveries that reactive oxygen species initiated lipid peroxidation leads to the formation of potentially toxic lipid aldehyde species such as 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE). acrolein. and malondialdehyde which activate various signaling intermediates that regulate cellular activity and dysfunction via a process called redox signaling.

The activities of citrate synthase.

According to the differences in enzyme activities. the muscles can be divided into three classes. First. in a number of both vertebrate and invertebrate muscles. the activities of all three enzymes are very low. It is suggested that either the muscles use energy at a very low rate or they rely largely on anaerobic glycolysis for higher rates of energy formation. Second. most insect flight muscles contain high activities of citrate synthase and NAD+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase. but the activities of the NADP+-linked enzyme are very low.

121994,Carnitine acyltransferases: functional significance of subcellular distribution and membrane topology,1999,Victor A Zammit,38,,3,199-224,Pergamon,Esterification of carboxylic acids to coenzyme A (CoA) through a thioester bond is a common strategy used in metabolic processes toactivate'the relevant metabolite. Starting with the acid itself. the process requires an input of energy in the form of the simultaneous hydrolysis of nucleotide triphosphate. In general. it represents the first step that admits the metabolite to a particular pathway. Although examples of CoA ester formation abound in metabolism. there are two universal consequences: it renders the metabolite (or rather its CoA ester) impermeant through cellular membranes. and (ii) it sequesters CoA from the limited pools that exist in individual subcellular compartments. As a result. the pools of CoA esters of the metabolite are maintained separate in the different cellular compartments. and may have different properties and exert separate effects in their respective locations. In the case of acyl-CoA esters. the need to control the concentration of the individual esters is imperative because of the high biological activity displayed by some of them. Indeed. most of this review concerns the effects of acyl-CoA esters on different cellular processes. Consequently. the cell has two requirements:(i) a mechanism for the control of CoA ester concentrations that is rapid and does not involve the energetically expensive hydrolysis and resynthesis of the esters from the free acid; and (ii) a system that. after the initial synthesis of the CoA ester. enables the acyl moiety to permeate membranes without the need to re-expend energy.

We examined the consequence of over- or underexpression of PDI in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells for the redox state of cell-surface protein thiols/disulfides. Overexpression of PDI resulted in 3.6–4.2-fold enhanced secretion of PDI and 1.5–1.7-fold increase in surface-bound PDI. Antisense-mediated underexpression of PDI caused 38–53% decreased secretion and 10–33% decrease in surface-bound PDI. Using 5.5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) to measure surface protein thiols. a 41–50% increase in surface thiols was observed in PDI-overexpressing cells. whereas a 29–33% decrease was observed in underexpressing cells.

Native (unoxidized) DJ-1 did not inhibit α-synuclein fibrillation. and no evidence for stable interactions between α-synuclein and native DJ-1 was observed. However. DJ-1 is very susceptible to oxidation by the addition of two oxygen atoms to form the sulfinic acid of Cys106 (2O DJ-1) (no 1O oxidized state is detectable). 2O DJ-1 was readily prepared by the addition of H2O2 at concentrations up to a 20-fold molar excess. The oxidation of Cys106 to the sulfinic acid had minimal effect on the structural …,True,YRyrCzEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,376,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283605015925,4056288039461038341,/scholar?cites=4056288039461038341,,,0,0,0

This article describes the three-dimensional simulation of internal flow in three different types of centrifugal pumps (one pump has four straight blades and the other two have six twisted blades). A commercial three-dimensional Navier-Stokes code called CFX. with a standard – two-equation turbulence model was used to simulate the problem under examination. In the calculation. the finite-volume method and an unstructured grid system were used for the solution procedure of the discretized governing equations for this problem.Comparison of computational results for various types of pumps showed good agreement for the twisted-blade pumps. However. for the straight-blade pump. the computational results were somewhat different from widely published experimental results. It was found that the predicted results relating to twisted-blade pumps were better than those relating to the straight-blade pump. which suggests that the efficiency of a twisted-blade pump will be greater than that of a straight-blade pump.

Many animal lectins (sugar‐binding proteins) mediate both pathogen recognition and cell‐cell interactions using structurally related Ca2+‐dependent carbohydrate‐recognition domains (C‐type CRDs). Pathogen recognition by soluble collections such as serum mannose‐binding protein and pulmonary surfactant proteins. and also the macrophage cell‐surface mannose receptor. is effected by binding of terminal monosaccharide residues characteristic of bacterial and fungal cell surfaces.

The crystal structure of UP1. the amino-terminal domain of human hnRNP A1 containing two RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs). bound to a 12-nucleotide single-stranded telomeric DNA has been determined at 2.1 Å resolution. The structure of the complex reveals the basis for sequence-specific recognition of the single-stranded overhangs of human telomeres by hnRNP A1. It also provides insights into the basis for high-affinity binding of hnRNP A1 to certain RNA sequences. and for nucleic acid binding and functional synergy between the RRMs. In the crystal structure. a UP1 dimer binds to two strands of DNA. and each strand contacts RRM1 of one monomer and RRM2 of the other.

Homer and Shank are among the most abundant scaffolding proteins in the PSD. working synergistically for maturation of dendritic spines. Here. we demonstrate that Homer and Shank. together. form a mesh-like matrix structure. Crystallographic analysis of this region revealed a pair of parallel dimeric coiled coils intercalated in a tail-to-tail fashion to form a tetramer. giving rise to the unique configuration of a pair of N-terminal EVH1 domains at each end of the coiled coil. In neurons. the tetramerization is required for structural integrity of the dendritic spines and recruitment of proteins to synapses.

However. the mechanism of inhibition is not established. These studies were carried out to test the hypothesis that Rho-kinase (Rho-associated kinase) via phosphorylation of the myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) inhibited MP activity and to identify relevant sites of phosphorylation. Phosphorylation by Rho-kinase inhibited MP activity and this reflected a decrease in V max. Activity of MP with different substrates also was inhibited by phosphorylation. Two major sites of phosphorylation on MYPT1 were Thr695 and Thr850. Various point mutations were designed for these phosphorylation sites.

Using natural and model pre-mRNAs. we have examined whether the ratio of SF2/ASF to hnRNP A1 also regulates other modes of alternative splicing in vitro. We found that an excess of SF2/ASF effectively prevents inappropriate exon skipping and also influences the selection of mutually exclusive tissue-specific exons in natural beta-tropomyosin pre-mRNA. In contrast. an excess of hnRNP A1 does not cause inappropriate exon skipping in natural constitutively or alternatively spliced pre-mRNAs. Although hnRNP A1 can promote alternative exon skipping. this effect is not universal and is dependent. e.g.. on the size of the internal alternative exon and on the strength of …,True,alY3nNwAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,297,https://mcb.asm.org/content/13/5/2993.short,15945381183067046964,/scholar?cites=15945381183067046964,,https://mcb.asm.org/content/mcb/13/5/2993.full.pdf,0,0,0

We find that either protein can reconstitute the splicing activity of S100 extracts and of SC35-immunodepleted nuclear extracts. Previous studies revealed that SF2 influences alternative 59 splice site selection in vitro. by favoring proximal over distal 59 splice sites. and that the A1 protein of heterogeneous nuclear RNP counteracts this effect.

Here. we present a detailed analysis of transfection efficiency and cell viability for femtosecond optical transfection using a titanium sapphire laser at 800 nm. Photoporation of 4000 Chinese Hamster ovary cells was performed. representing the largest optical transfection study reported to date. We have investigated a range of laser fluences at the cell membrane and. at 1.2 µJ/cm^2. have found an average transfection efficiency of 50 ± 10%. Contrary to recent literature. in which 100% efficiency is claimed. our measure of efficiency accounts for all irradiated cells. including those lost as a result of laser treatment. thereby providing a true biological measure of the technique.,True,-ALssBIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,228,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-14-16-7125,9071538111488447275,/scholar?cites=9071538111488447275,,https://www.osapublishing.org/viewmedia.cfm?seq=0&uri=oe-14-16-7125,0,0,0

To address this need. many transfection techniques have been developed including viral. lipoplex. polyplex. capillary microinjection. gene gun and electroporation. The current discussion explores a procedure called optical injection. where a laser field transiently increases the membrane permeability to allow species to be internalized. If the internalized substance is a nucleic acid. such as DNA. RNA or small interfering RNA (siRNA). then the process is called optical transfection.

In addition to the wild-type protein. we studied CaM containing the unnatural amino acid selenomethionine (SeMet). which was biosynthetically substituted for its nine Met residues. Furthermore. a CaM mutant protein in which all four Met residues in the C-terminal domain were mutated to Leu. and the N-terminal domain contained either Met or the unnatural SeMet. was studied. The Trp fluorescence quantum yield of many Trp-containing CaM-binding peptides increases upon binding to calcium-CaM.

In this paper. we exploit data available from recent literature to compile a nonredundant list of 1989 proteins and elaborate it with pathway and network analyses. Upon network analysis. it is intuitively confirmed that red blood cells likely suffer of exacerbated oxidative stress and continuously strive against protein and cytoskeletal damage. It also emerges that erythrocyte interaction networks display a high degree of maturity. Indeed. a series of core proteins were individuated to play a central role. A catalytic ring of proteins counteracting oxidative stress was individuated as well.

122216,Refeeding syndrome: problems with definition and management,2014,Martin A Crook,30,Nutrition,11-12,1448-1455,Elsevier,Refeeding syndrome (RFS) broadly encompasses a severe electrolyte disturbance (principally low serum concentrations of intracellular ions such as phosphate. magnesium. and potassium) and metabolic abnormalities in undernourished patients undergoing refeeding whether orally. enterally. or parenterally. RFS reflects the change from catabolic to anabolic metabolism. RFS sometimes is undiagnosed and unfortunately some clinicians remain oblivious to its presence. This is particularly concerning as RFS is a life-threatening condition. although it need not be so and early recognition reduces morbidity and mortality. Careful patient monitoring and multidiscipline nutrition team management may help to achieve this goal. The diagnosis of RFS is not facilitated by the fact that there is no universal agreement as to its definition.

122229,Biosynthesis of conjugated linoleic acid and its incorporation into meat and milk in ruminants,1999,JM Griinari and DE Bauman,1,Advances in conjugated linoleic acid research,1,180-200,,Meat and milk from ruminant animals represent the major dietary sources of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Because potential health benefits have been associated with dietary consumption of CLA. enhancement of CLA concentrations in meat and milk has become an important objective in animal nutrition research. Dietary intake of CLA has decreased over recent years in many Western societies as ruminant fats have been replaced by plant lipids. In addition. decreases in total energy intake from dietary fat have occurred mainly in the portion of saturated animal fats as reviewed by Pietinen et al.(1).Parodi (2) first established cis-9. trans-11 octadecadienoic acid as the major CLA component in bovine milk fat. This same CLA isomer had been identified previously as the first intermediate of linoleic acid biohydrogenation in the rumen (3). It is generally accepted that CLA in ruminant meat and milk originates from incomplete biohydrogenation of linoleic acid in the rumen (4. 5). However. in accepting this simple explanation for the presence of CLA in ruminant lipids. we have failed to recognize several important features in the ruminal biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids. These suggest that the amount of CLA escaping rumen biohydrogenation and being absorbed may be inadequate to account for CLA levels in milk and body fat. Milk fat concentrations of CLA are known to vary among herds and individuals. and between seasons (2. 4. 6. 88). Underlying factors resulting in this variation are related predominately to diet as reviewed by Jahreis et al.(Chapter 16).

Interest in these compounds has expanded since CLA were found to be associated with a number of physiological and pathological responses such as cancer. metastases. atherosclerosis. diabetes. immunity. and body fat/protein composition. The main sources of these conjugated fatty acids are dairy fats. Rumen bacteria convert polyunsaturated fatty acids. especially linoleic and linolenic acids. to CLA and numerous trans- containing mono- and diunsaturated fatty acids.
