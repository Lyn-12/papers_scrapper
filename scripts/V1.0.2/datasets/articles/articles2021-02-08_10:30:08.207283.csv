The altered surface structures can account for functional differences among the members of a family. Sliding of the intron-exon junctions may constitute one mechanism for generating length polymorphisms and divergent sequences found in protein families.

Underlying this disease is the aberrant action of the androgen receptor (AR). AR is distinguished from other nuclear receptors in that after hormone binding. it preferentially responds to a specialized set of coactivators bearing aromatic-rich motifs. while responding poorly to coactivators bearing the leucine-rich “NR box” motifs favored by other nuclear receptors. Under normal conditions. interactions with these AR-specific coactivators through aromatic-rich motifs underlie targeted gene transcription. However. during prostate cancer. abnormal association with such coactivators. as well as with coactivators containing canonical leucine-rich motifs. promotes disease progression. To understand the paradox of this unusual selectivity. we have derived a complete set of peptide motifs that interact with AR using phage display. Binding affinities were measured for a selected set of these peptides and their interactions with AR determined by X-ray crystallography. Structures of AR in complex with FxxLF. LxxLL. FxxLW. WxxLF. WxxVW. FxxFF. and FxxYF motifs reveal a changing surface of the AR coactivator binding interface that permits accommodation of both AR-specific aromatic-rich motifs and canonical leucine-rich motifs.

We have previously cloned the gene for glycogen phosphorylase (GPH1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To assess the role of glycogen and phosphorylase-catalyzed glycogenolysis in the yeast life cycle. yeast strains lacking a functional GPH1 gene or containing multiple copies of the gene were constructed. GPH1 was found not to be an essential gene in yeast cells. Haploid cells disrupted in GPH1 lacked phosphorylase activity and attained higher levels of intracellular glycogen but otherwise were similar to wild-type cells. Diploid cells homozygous for the disruption were able to sporulate and give rise to viable ascospores. Absence of functional GPH1 did not impair cells from synthesizing and storing trehalose. Increases in phosphorylase activity of 10- to 40-fold were detected in cells carrying …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC,114,https://mcb.asm.org/content/9/4/1659.short,6564000900551859962,/scholar?cites=6564000900551859962,,https://mcb.asm.org/content/mcb/9/4/1659.full.pdf,0,0,0

T. foetus HGXPRTase crystallizes as an asymmetric dimer. with GMP bound to only one of the two molecules that form the asymmetric unit. Each molecule of HGXPRTase is formed by two lobes joined by a short “hinge” region. and the GMP binds in a cavity between the two lobes. A comparison of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit shows that the hinge region is flexible and that ligand binding affects the relative positions of the two lobes. The binding of GMP brings the two lobes closer together. rotating one lobe by about 5° relative to the other.

The TR-LBD folding. comprised mostly of α-helices. is likely to be general for the superfamily. The ligand. buried in the receptor. forms part of its hydrophobic core. Tight fitting of ligand into the receptor explains its high affinity for the TR. although the structure suggests that ligands with even higher affinities might be generated.

A polar cave provides the stabilization for maintaining the buried charge. and it features the conserved amino acid Ser214 adjacent to Aspl02. Ser214 has been replaced with Ala. Glu. and Lys in rat anionic trypsin. and the consequences of these changes have been determined. Three-dimensional structures of the Glu and Lys variant trypsins reveal that the new 214 side chains are buried. The 2.2-A crystal structure (R= 0.150) of trypsin S214K shows that Lys214occupies the position held by Ser214 and a buried water molecule in the buried polar cave. Lys214-Nf is solvent inaccessible and is less than 5 A from the catalytic Aspl02. The side chain of Glu214 (2.8 k. R=0.168) in trypsin S214E shows two conformations.

To address the structural basis of its broad specificity. the gene for ecotin has been cloned and its sequence determined. A promoter of the 17-base pair spacing class was identified. and the probable transcriptional start site lies 18 base pairs upstream from a ribosome binding locus. The gene is followed by a series of conserved repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences. Ecotin has a signal peptide of 20 amino acids which confirms its periplasmic localization.

This pan-specificity of inhibition is believed to derive from formation of a heterotetrameric complex with target proteases involving three types of interface: the dimerization interface. a primary substrate-like interaction. and a smaller secondary interaction between the partner ecotin subunit and the protease. A monomeric ecotin variant (mEcotin) and a single-chain ecotin dimer (scEcotin) were constructed to study the effect of a network of protein interactions on binding affinity and the role of dimerization in broad inhibitor specificity. mEcotin was produced by inserting a β-turn into the C-terminal arm. which normally exchanges with the other subunit.

Although LRH-1 is able to bind phospholipids. it is still considered an orphan nuclear receptor (NR) with an unknown regulatory hormone.

Presently. no natural or synthetic ligand has been identified for a large group of orphan NRs. Small molecules to target these orphan NRs will provide unique resources for uncovering regulatory systems that impact human health and to modulate these pathways with drugs. The orphan NR tailless (TLX. NR2E1). a transcriptional repressor. is a major player in neurogenesis and Neural Stem Cell (NSC) derived brain tumors. No chemical probes that modulate TLX activity are available. and it is not clear whether TLX is druggable. To assess TLX ligand binding capacity. we created homology models of the TLX ligand binding domain (LBD). Results suggest that TLX belongs to an emerging class of NRs that lack LBD helices α1 and α2 and that it has potential to form a large open ligand binding pocket (LBP). Using a medium throughput screening strategy. we investigated direct binding of 20.000 compounds to purified human TLX protein and verified interactions with a secondary (orthogonal) assay. We then assessed effects of verified binders on TLX activity using luciferase assays. As a result. we report identification of three compounds (ccrp1. ccrp2 and ccrp3) that bind to recombinant TLX protein with affinities in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range and enhance TLX transcriptional repressive activity.

FKBP52 is a positive regulator of AR in cellular and whole animal models and is required for the development of androgen-dependent tissues. We previously characterized an AR inhibitor termed MJC13 that putatively targets the AR BF3 surface to specifically inhibit FKBP52-regulated AR signaling. Predictive modeling suggests that β-catenin interacts with the AR hormone binding domain on a surface that overlaps with BF3. Here we demonstrate that FKBP52 and β-catenin interact directly in vitro and act in concert to promote a synergistic up-regulation of both hormone-independent and -dependent AR signaling. Our data demonstrate that FKBP52 promotes β-catenin interaction with AR and is required for β-catenin co-activation of AR activity in prostate cancer cells. MJC13 effectively blocks β-catenin interaction with the AR LBD and the synergistic up-regulation of AR by FKBP52 and β-catenin. Our data suggest that co-regulation of AR by FKBP52 and β-catenin does not require FKBP52 PPIase catalytic activity. nor FKBP52 binding to Hsp90.

Antiandrogens compete with the natural hormone and are front line therapeutics to treat prostate cancer. However. antiandrogens frequently become ineffective after prolonged treatment because of development of tumor resistance. This paper reviews design principles for new generations of antiandrogens: super antagonists and surface allosteric modulators. Super antiandrogens are compounds with higher binding affinity than natural agonists and that contain precisely engineered hydrophobic groups that disrupt AR function. AR surface is also an attractive alternative target. Surface inhibitors are small molecules that directly block the receptor–co-activator interface. preventing co-activator recruitment.

Here. we investigated whether disulfide-trapping. an approach new to nuclear receptors. would provide effective lead compounds targeting human liver receptor homolog 1 (hLRH-1. NR5A2). Despite the fact that hLRH-1 contains a large ligand binding pocket and binds phospholipids with high affinity. existing synthetic hLRH-1 ligands are of limited utility due to poor solubility. low efficacy or significant off-target effects. Using disulfide-trapping. we identified a lead compound that conjugates with remarkably high-efficiency to a native cysteine residue (Cys346) lining the hydrophobic cavity in the ligand binding domain of hLRH-1. Guided by computational modeling and cellular assays. the lead compound was elaborated into ligands PME8 and PME9 that bind hLRH-1 reversibly (no cysteine reactivity) and increase hLRH-1 activity in cells. When compared with the existing hLRH-1 synthetic agonist RJW100. both PME8 and PME9 showed comparable induction of the LRH-1 dependent target gene CYP24A1 in human HepG2 cells. beginning as early as 3 h after drug treatment. The induction is specific as siRNA-mediated knock-down of hLRH-1 renders both PME8 and PME9 ineffective. These data show that PME8 and PME9 are potent activators of hLRH-1 and suggest that with further development this lead series may yield useful chemical probes for manipulating LRH-1 activity in vivo.,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C,10,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159316,12721520700988632410,/scholar?cites=12721520700988632410,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159316,0,0,0

HIP1 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. The binding of HIP1 to actin is regulated through an interaction with clathrin light chain. Clathrin light chain binds to a flexible coiled-coil domain in HIP1 and induces a compact state that is refractory to actin binding. To understand the mechanism of this conformational regulation. a high-resolution crystal structure of a stable fragment from the HIP1 coiled-coil domain was determined. The flexibility of the HIP1 coiled-coil region was evident from its variation from a previously determined structure of a similar region. A hydrogen-bond network and changes in coiled-coil monomer interaction suggest that the HIP1 coiled-coil domain is uniquely suited to allow conformational flexibility.,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,7,https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S0907444909054535,2372503989890038333,/scholar?cites=2372503989890038333,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2827350/,0,0,0

The molecular mechanism of microtubule bundling by KCBP remains unknown. KCBP binding to microtubules is regulated by Ca2+-binding proteins that recognize its C-terminal regulatory domain. In this work. we have discovered a new function of the regulatory domain. We present a crystal structure of an Arabidopsis KCBP fragment showing that the C-terminal regulatory domain forms a dimerization interface for KCBP. This dimerization site is distinct from the dimerization interface within the N-terminal domain. Side chains of hydrophobic residues of the calmodulin binding helix of the regulatory domain form the C-terminal dimerization interface. Biochemical experiments show that another segment of the regulatory domain located beyond the dimerization interface. its negatively charged coil. is unexpectedly and absolutely required to stabilize the dimers. The strong microtubule bundling properties of KCBP are unaffected by deletion of the C-terminal regulatory domain. The slow minus-end directed motility of KCBP is also unchanged in vitro. Although the C-terminal domain is not essential for microtubule bundling. we suggest that KCBP may use its two independent dimerization interfaces to support different types of bundled microtubule structures in cells. Two distinct dimerization sites may provide a mechanism for microtubule rearrangement in response to Ca2+ signaling since Ca2+- binding proteins can disengage KCBP dimers dependent on its C …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:AXkvAH5U_nMC,5,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066669,17782376745118013296,/scholar?cites=17782376745118013296,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066669,0,0,0

Ebashi (Ebashi. 1963; Ebashi et al.. 1967) highlighted the importance of regulation of muscle contraction and sparked numerous experimental studies of the mysterious protein troponin whose properties are now becoming understood at satisfying resolution.,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC,4,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-38453-3_6,13063464247752920039,/scholar?cites=13063464247752920039,,,0,0,0
86315,The androgen receptor coactivator-binding interface,2009,Eva Estébanez-Perpiñá and Robert J Fletterick,,,,297-311,Springer. New York. NY,When hormone binds to the androgen receptor (AR). the ligand-binding domain (LBD) becomes ordered. displaying a new protein–protein interaction surface called AF2 (coactivator-binding pocket). which is a hydrophobic groove that fits AR coregulators. The association of coregulators with AR LBD is often a critical step for its transcriptional function. Existing pharmaceuticals block AR activity by disrupting AF2 surface's ability to recruit coactivators. Such antagonists bind to the hormone-binding site inside the LBD core and perturb the structure of the most terminal helix of the LBD. distorting the AF2 surface. The AF2 pocket is also a potential candidate for pharmaceutical intervention by surface-directed small molecules that will directly block coactivator recruitment. Such molecules may be a novel generation of antiandrogens for treating prostate cancer.,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC,3,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-69179-4_13,7214525691415354921,/scholar?cites=7214525691415354921,,,0,0,0

As with the first-line therapeutic bicalutamide (Casodex). resistance to newer antiandrogens (enzalutamide. ARN-509) develops quickly in patients. despite the fact that these drugs have ∼10-fold better affinity for the androgen receptor than bicalutamide. Improving affinity alone is often not sufficient to prevent resistance. and alternative strategies are needed to improve antiandrogen efficacy. Covalent and reversible covalent drugs are being used to thwart drug resistance in other contexts. and activated aryl nitriles are among the moieties being exploited for this purpose. We capitalized on the presence of an aryl nitrile in bicalutamide. and the existence of a native cysteine residue (Cys784) in the androgen receptor ligand binding pocket. to develop 5N-bicalutamide. a cysteine-reactive antiandrogen …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC,2,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acschembio.7b00702,11773169962974339597,/scholar?cites=11773169962974339597,,,0,0,0

Our research is innovative in its approach because the target protein is known to control not just one but multiple regulatory mechanisms essential for tumor growth and spread. Thus by targeting this protein. one might be able to de-activate these mechanisms. inhibiting and even reversing the progression of pancreatic cancer. Conceivably. dietary modifications that affect LRH-1 function may spawn a prophylactic approach to the disease. An additional appeal of LRH-1 as a drug target includes its well-studied ligand-binding pocket. which could be targeted by specific drugs. and the proven efficiency of nuclear receptor inhibitors for treatment of different types of malignancies. including breast and prostate cancers. In this project. we show how to discover selective inhibitors of LRH-1 and analyze them in pancreatic cancer cells. The identified novel inhibitors of LRH-1 could then be developed into a pharmaceutical that will inhibit growth and proliferation of cancer cells in pancreatic tumors. advancing the existing pancreatic cancer therapies.Descriptors:,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC,1,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA621081,6462131621620487894,/scholar?cites=6462131621620487894,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA621081.pdf,0,0,0

Colorectal cancers (CRC) account for nearly 10% of cancer deaths in industrialized countries. Recent evidence points to a central role for the nuclear receptor Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1) in intestinal tumorigenesis. Interaction of LRH-1 with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. highly active in a critical subpopulation of CRC cancer cells. underscores the importance of elucidating LRH-1's role in this disease. Reduction of LRH-1 diminishes tumor burden in murine models of CRC. The central role of receptor LRH-1 in CRC pathogenesis and a wealth of structural data at atomic resolution make LRH-1 an attractive target. Methods: To evaluate the contributions of LRH-1 to CRC growth. we constructed stably transduced CRC cell lines expressing Tet-inducible shRNA directed against LRH-1.

Bell,2012,Stephen Sprang and Robert Fletterick and William J Rutter,,Gene Regulation,,35,Elsevier,The cloning and sequencing of genes of proteins whose structure is known allows a comparison of the localization of intervening sequences with the structural features of the proteins. In some instances. the intron positions seem to demarcate structural and/or functional units. but in others. there is no obvious relationship between the protein and gene structure. Comparison with tertiary structures indicates that the intron positions in the gene correspond to the external boundary rather than the interior of the protein. This localization is confirmed by a solvent accessible sur-face analysis which shows that the intron junctions are almost always located at the protein-solvent interface. While the surface rule is based on observations of a few relatively small globular proteins with known tertiary structure. it is further supported by the observation that the consensus sequences at the 5'(but not the 3') intron/exon splice junctions predominantly code for hydrophilic and surface type amino acids. These results suggest that intron placements may have played a role in protein evolution. For example. intron junctions may be sites of hypervariability and hence of structural change. If so. such junctions would be better accommo-dated on the surface. rather than the interior where changes would likely result in distortion or destruction of the architecture of the molecule. Consistent with these ideas. certain evolutionary variations in the Serine protease family appear to correlate with intron location. Experimental studies on the expression of the human insul in gene in heterologous mammalian cells using SV40 viral vectors show that the normal splicing can occur. but that …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Mv8rL9dhCDEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA35&dq=info:5vTv1JRpybcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=LUV69LfDXV&sig=Zg03-jaXSTcTTYdUQ7XNMev7AwE,,,,,0,0,0

Spectra of spin probes attached to single Cys (S1220C or S1215C) on the neck mimic showed a mobile and an immobilized component. There was a significantly higher content of the immobile component in the spectrum of the Cys1220 mutant.

86361,Inhibitors for Androgen Receptor Activation Surfaces,2006,Robert J Fletterick,,,,,CALIFORNIA UNIV SAN FRANCISCO,The androgen receptor AR is a proven therapeutic target for treating prostate cancer. Known therapeutics target the ligand binding domain LBD at the exact place where dihydrotestosterone DHT binds. Upon binding DHT. AR reorganizes to form new interaction surfaces such as the AF2 surface that attracts coregulators. AF2 has been proposed as a second therapeutic target as coactivator recruitment is a key step for AR function. We developed two screening methods to find compounds that bind to AF2. Our method has proved successful with the thyroid receptor. In solution. a competition assay reports coactivator displacement and 3D screening by X-ray crystallography visualizes the compounds on the receptor. Two classes of compounds have been identified that bind to AF2 the first class bind weakly and do not compete with coactivator binding 2-methylindole. and two protein kinase inhibitors. while the second class have micromolar affinity and compete with coactivator binding TRIAC. and three aspirin derivatives. Screening revealed a significant and undiscovered cryptic surface site that we call binding function 3 BF3. which might be implicated in AR regulation. These are the first compounds reported to block AR protein-protein interactions and might serve as starting templates for more selective and effective antiandrogens.Descriptors:,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC,0,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA462434,,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA462434.pdf,0,0,0

Most nuclear receptors recruit steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) to their ligand binding domain (LBD) using a leucine-rich motif (LXXLL). AR is believed to recruit unique coactivators to its LBD using an aromaticrich motif (FXXLF) while recruiting SRCs to its N-terminal domain (NTD) through an alternate mechanism. Here. we report that the AR-LBD interacts with both FXXLF motifs and a subset of LXXLL motifs and that contacts with these LXXLL motifs are both necessary and sufficient for SRC-mediated AR regulation of transcription. Crystal structures of the activated AR in complex with both recruitment motifs reveal that side chains unique to the AR-LBD rearrange to bind either the bulky FXXLF motifs or the more compact LXXLL motifs and that AR utilizes subsidiary contacts with LXXLL flanking sequences to discriminate between LXXLL motifs.,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/46424384/The_molecular_mechanisms_of_coactivator_20160612-12332-19bjywo.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46424384/The_molecular_mechanisms_of_coactivator_20160612-12332-19bjywo.pdf,0,0,0

DC]: American Society for Microbiology. 1981-,Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor with no known ligand. We showed previously that phosphorylation at serine 203 located N'-terminal to the ligand binding domain (LBD) enhanced cofactor recruitment. analogous to the ligand-mediated recruitment in ligand-dependent receptors. In this study. results of biochemical analyses and an LBD helix assembly assay suggest that the SF-1 LBD adopts an active conformation. with helices 1 and 12 packed against the predicted alpha-helical bundle. in the apparent absence of ligand. Fine mapping of the previously defined proximal activation function in SF-1 showed that the activation function mapped fully to helix 1 of the LBD. Limited proteolyses demonstrate that phosphorylation of S203 in the hinge region mimics the stabilizing effects of ligand on the LBD. Moreover. similar effects were observed in an SF-1/thyroid hormone LBD chimera receptor …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3573535130115288924&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

This reaction requires an efficient membrane binding. and the N-terminal beta-barrel domain of the enzyme has been implicated in this process. To obtain detailed information on the structural requirements for membrane oxygenation. we expressed the rabbit wild-type 15-lipoxygenase. its beta-barrel deletion mutant (catalytic domain). and several lipoxygenase point mutations as His-tagged fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and tested their membrane binding characteristics. We found that: (i) the beta-barrel deletion mutant was catalytically active and its enzymatic properties (KM. Vmax. pH optimum. substrate specificity) were similar to those of the wild-type enzyme; (ii) when compared with the wild-type lipoxygenase. the membrane binding properties …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1797044105383021922&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

We performed a comprehensive x-ray crystal structure-guided mutation analysis of the TR ligand binding domain (TR LBD) surface to map the functional interface for TR homodimers and heterodimers with RXR in the absence and/or in the presence of DNA. We also identified the molecular contacts in TR LBDs crystallized as dimers. The results show that crystal dimer contacts differ from those found in the functional studies. We found that identical TR LBD residues found in helices 10 and 11 are involved in TR homodimerization and heterodimerization with RXR. Moreover. the same TR LBD surface is operative for dimerization with direct repeats spaced by 4 base pairs (DR-4) and with the inverted palindrome spaced by 6 base pairs (F2). but not …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9942487542736126806&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Boston. MA,Most protozoan parasites. such as Leishmania. Plasmodium. Toxoplasma and Trypanosoma. rely on a salvage pathway for their supply of purine ribonucleotides (Wang. 1984). Inhibition of this pathway therefore presents an interesting approach in the fight against microbial infections. To explore the feasibility of this approach we have attempted to identify inhibitors of the essential purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGXPRTase) of the protozoan parasite Tritrichomonas foetus. This sexually transmitted parasite causes causes bovine trichomoniasis. which can lead to embryonic death and infertility in cows. T. foetus relies primarily on a single enzyme. HGXPRTase. to transfer ribose 5-phosphate from α-D-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate to the N9 nitrogen atom of hypoxanthine. guanine or xanthine (Wang et al.. 1983).

We have developed an expression system for phosphorylases that allows us to investigate the structural basis of this regulatory difference. The genes or cDNAS to muscle. liver. and yeast phosphorylases were previously cloned. To serve as expression host. a yeast strain was constructed in which the endogenous phosphorylase gene was disabled. An expression vector was constructed from the yeast 2u plasmid YEp24 plus 5! and 3'flanking regions of the yeast phosphorylase gene. The vector was able to direct high-level expression of yeast phosphorylase (1-3% of total protein). Using this system. we attempted to express rabbit muscle and human liver phosphor-ylases. and a protein from a muscle-liver hybrid CDNA.,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12282642055292293741&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
