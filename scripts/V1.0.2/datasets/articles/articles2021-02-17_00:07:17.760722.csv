We show that Vpus from SIVgsn. SIVmus. and SIVmon infecting Cercopithecus primate species also degrade CD4 and antagonize tetherin. In contrast. SIVcpz. the immediate precursor of HIV-1. whose Vpu shares a common ancestry with SIVgsn/mus/mon Vpu. uses Nef rather than Vpu to counteract chimpanzee tetherin. Human tetherin. however. is resistant to Nef and thus poses a significant barrier to zoonotic transmission of SIVcpz to humans. Remarkably. Vpus from nonpandemic HIV-1 O strains are poor tetherin antagonists. whereas those from the rare group N viruses do not degrade CD4. Thus. only HIV-1 M evolved a fully functional Vpu following the three independent cross-species transmissions that resulted in HIV-1 groups M. N. and O.

1035957,Virus budding and the ESCRT pathway,2013,Jörg Votteler and Wesley I Sundquist,14,,3,232-241,Cell Press,Enveloped viruses escape infected cells by budding through limiting membranes. In the decade since the discovery that HIV recruits cellular ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) machinery to facilitate viral budding. this pathway has emerged as the major escape route for enveloped viruses. In cells. the ESCRT pathway catalyzes analogous membrane fission events required for the abscission stage of cytokinesis and for a series of “reverse topology” vesiculation events. Studies of enveloped virus budding are therefore providing insights into the complex cellular mechanisms of cell division and membrane protein trafficking (and vice versa). Here. we review how viruses mimic cellular recruiting signals to usurp the ESCRT pathway. discuss mechanistic models for ESCRT pathway functions. and highlight important research frontiers.,True,T-jJRycAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,384,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312813002941,6884428449150220199,/scholar?cites=6884428449150220199,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312813002941,0,0,0

However. FRET microscopy is technically challenging and does not allow assessing interactions in large cell numbers. To overcome these limitations we developed a flow cytometry-based FRET assay and analysed interactions of human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV and SIV) Nef and Vpu proteins with cellular factors. as well as HIV Rev multimer-formation.  Results Amongst others. we characterize the interaction of Vpu with CD317 (also termed Bst-2 or tetherin). a host restriction factor that inhibits HIV release from infected cells and demonstrate that the direct binding of both is mediated by the Vpu membrane-spanning region. Furthermore. we adapted our assay to allow the identification of novel protein interaction partners in a high-throughput format.  Conclusion The presented combination of FRET and FACS offers the precious possibility to discover and define protein interactions in living cells and is expected to contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for treatment of human diseases.,True,T-jJRycAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,150,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009344,13710299852672200808,/scholar?cites=13710299852672200808,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009344,0,0,0

The HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu) and the EBOV-glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) both inhibit tetherin. Here. we compared tetherin counteraction by EBOV-GP and Vpu. We found that EBOV-GP but not Vpu counteracted tetherin from different primate species. indicating that EBOV-GP and Vpu target tetherin differentially. Tetherin interacted with the GP2 subunit of EBOV-GP. which might encode the determinants for tetherin counteraction. Vpu reduced cell surface expression of tetherin while EBOV-GP did not. suggesting that both proteins employ different mechanisms to counteract tetherin. Finally.

Here we analyzed whether the ion channel activity of Vpu is required to antagonize CD317-mediated restriction of virion release. We examined TM-mutants of three conserved residues: the S23A mutation. which was previously shown to abrogate ion channel function. did not affect Vpu mediated augmentation of virus release. In contrast. the A14N and A18N mutation did not affect ion channel activity of Vpu. but substantially reduced its ability to support virus release and to down-regulate CD317 from the cell surface.

In order to establish if the DNA content and the observed heterogeneity is maintained during different growth conditions. we have compared E. histolytica cells growing in xenic and axenic cultures. Our results show that the nuclear DNA content of E. histolytica trophozoites growing in axenic cultures is at least 10 fold higher than in xenic cultures. Re-association of axenic cultures with their bacterial flora led to a reduction of DNA content to the original xenic values. Thus switching between xenic and axenic growth conditions was accompanied by significant changes in the nuclear DNA content of this parasite. Changes in DNA content during encystation-excystation were studied in the related reptilian parasite E. invadens. During excystation of E. invadens cysts. it was observed that the nuclear DNA content increased approximately 40 fold following emergence of trophozoites in axenic cultures. Based on the observed large changes in nuclear size and DNA content. and the minor differences in relative abundance of representative protein coding sequences. rDNA and tRNA sequences. it appears that gain or loss of whole genome copies may be occurring during changes in the growth conditions.

In this study. we demonstrate that this genetic heterogeneity is an inherent feature of the cell cycle of this organism. Chromosome segregation occurs on a variety of novel microtubular assemblies including multi-polar spindles. Cytokinesis in E. histolytica is completed by the mechanical severing of a thin cytoplasmic bridge. either independently or with the help of neighboring cells. Importantly. cytokinesis is uncoupled from the nuclear division cycle. both temporally and spatially. leading to the formation of unequal daughter cells. Sorting of euploid and polyploid cells showed that each of these sub-populations acquired heterogeneous DNA content upon further growth.

Cells with multiple nuclei and nuclei with heterogenous genome contents suggest that regulatory mechanisms that ensure alternation of DNA synthesis and mitosis are absent in this organism. Therefore. several endo-reduplicative cycles may occur without mitosis. The data also shows that unlike other endo-reduplicating organisms. E. histolytica does not undergo a precise number of endo-reduplicative cycles. We propose that irregular endo-reduplication and genome partitioning lead to heterogeneity in the genome content of E. histolytica trophozoites in their proliferative phase.

Interfering with cytoplasmic capping results in the redistribution of target transcripts from polysomes to non-translating mRNPs. where they accumulate in an uncapped but nonetheless stable form. It is generally thought that decapping is preceded by shortening of the poly(A) tail to a length that can no longer support translation. Therefore recapped target transcripts would either have to undergo cytoplasmic polyadenylation or retain a reasonably long poly(A) tail if they are to return to the translating pool. In cells that are inhibited for cytoplasmic capping there is no change in the overall distribution of poly(A) lengths or in the elution profile of oligo(dT)-bound targets.

Many ecosystems are dependent on CO2 fixation by either free-living or symbiotic chemoautotrophs. CO2 fixation in the chemoautotroph occurs via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. The cycle is characterized by three unique enzymatic activities: ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. phosphoribulokinase. and sedoheptulose bisphosphatase. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase is commonly found in the cytoplasm. but a number of bacteria package much of the enzyme into polyhedral organelles. the carboxysomes.

The chromosomal positions of important frost tolerance and winter survival QTLs on Festuca and Lolium chromosomes 4 and 5 are most likely orthologs of QTLs on Triticeae chromosome 5 which correspond to a cluster of CBF-genes and the major vernalization gene. Gene expression and protein accumulation analyses after cold acclimation shed light on general responses to cold stress. These responses involve modulation of transcription levels of genes encoding proteins involved in cell signalling. cellular transport and proteins associated with the cell membrane.

Species of the subfamily Pooideae. which includes wheat. barley and important forage grasses. have evolved extreme frost tolerance. A class of ice binding proteins that inhibit ice re-crystallisation. specific to the Pooideae subfamily lineage. have been identified in perennial ryegrass and wheat. and these proteins are thought to have evolved from a leucine-rich repeat phytosulfokine receptor kinase (LRR-PSR)-like ancestor gene. Even though the ice re-crystallisation inhibition function of these proteins has been studied extensively in vitro. little is known about the evolution of these genes on the molecular level. We identified 15 putative novel ice re-crystallisation inhibition (IRI)-like protein coding genes in perennial ryegrass. barley. and wheat. Using synonymous divergence estimates we reconstructed the evolution of the IRI-like gene family. We also explored the hypothesis that the IRI-domain has evolved through repeated motif expansion and investigated the evolutionary relationship between a LRR-domain containing IRI coding gene in carrot and the Pooideae IRI-like genes. Our analysis showed that the main expansion of the IRI-gene family happened ~36 million years ago (Mya). In addition to IRI-like paralogs. wheat contained several sequences that likely were products of polyploidisation events (homoeologs). Through sequence analysis we identified two short motifs in the rice LRR-PSR gene highly similar to the repeat motifs of the IRI-domain in cold tolerant grasses.

The ice recrystallization inhibition protein (IRIP) genes. fructosyltransferase (FST) genes. and many C-repeat binding factor (CBF) genes are Pooideae specific and important in low temperature responses. Here we used comparative analyses to study conservation and evolution of these gene families in B. distachyon to better understand its potential as a model species for agriculturally important temperate grasses. Brachypodium distachyon contains cold responsive IRIP genes which have evolved through Brachypodium specific gene family expansions. A large cold responsive CBF3 subfamily was identified in B. distachyon. while CBF4 homologs are absent from the genome. No B. distachyon FST gene homologs encode typical core Pooideae FST-motifs and low temperature induced fructan accumulation was dramatically different in B. distachyon compared to core Pooideae species. We conclude that B. distachyon can serve as an interesting model for specific molecular mechanisms involved in low temperature responses in core Pooideae species. However. the evolutionary history of key genes involved in low temperature responses has been different in Brachypodium and core Pooideae species.

One major challenge for aquaculture production is a future stable. predictable and high quality feed supply. Marine oils represent 40% of today's feed. but an increased price and reduced availability is expected to cause a demand for alternative oil resources in the near future. In consequence. the use of vegetable oils as feed for farmed carnivorous cold-water fish is increasing. Although beneficial in some respects. this requires improved fatty acid composition in plants such as soybean or rapeseed to meet the nutritional demands of farmed fish.

This disease affects 200 million people worldwide and almost 800 million people are at risk of acquiring the infection. Although vaccine development against this disease has experienced more failures than successes. encouraging results have recently been obtained using membrane-spanning protein antigens from the tegument of Schistosoma mansoni. Our group recently identified Sm29. another antigen that is present at the adult worm tegument surface. In this study. we investigated murine cellular immune responses to recombinant (r) Sm29 and tested this protein as a vaccine candidate.  Methods and Findings We first show that Sm29 is located on the surface of adult worms and lung-stage schistosomula through confocal microscopy.

The parasite takes advantage of host signals to complete its development in the human body. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a human cytokine involved in skin inflammatory responses. and although its effect on the adult parasite's metabolism and egg-laying process has been previously described. a comprehensive assessment of the TNF-α pathway and its downstream molecular effects is lacking.  Methodology/Principal Findings In the present work we describe a possible TNF-α receptor (TNFR) homolog gene in S. mansoni (SmTNFR). SmTNFR encodes a complete receptor sequence composed of 599 amino acids. and contains four cysteine-rich domains as described for TNFR members. Real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed that SmTNFR highest expression level is in cercariae. 3.5 (±0.7) times higher than in adult worms. Downstream members of the known human TNF-α pathway were identified by an in silico analysis. revealing a possible TNF-α signaling pathway in the parasite. In order to simulate parasite's exposure to human cytokine during penetration of the skin. schistosomula were exposed to human TNF-α just 3 h after cercariae-to-schistosomula in vitro transformation. and large-scale gene expression measurements were performed with microarrays. A total of 548 genes with significantly altered expression were detected. when compared to control parasites. In addition. treatment of adult worms with TNF-α caused a significantly altered expression of 1857 genes. Interestingly. the set of genes altered in adults is different from that of …,True,BAIFUiAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,37,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000556,2010095408281631157,/scholar?cites=2010095408281631157,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000556,0,0,0

K. A.. Rochet. J. C.. Bieganski. R. M.. and Lansbury. P. T.. Jr. (2001) Science 294. 1346–1349). Dopamine inhibition of α-syn fibrillization generated exclusively spherical oligomers that depended on dopamine autoxidation but not α-syn oxidation. because mutagenesis of Met. His. and Tyr residues in α-syn did not abrogate this inhibition. However. truncation of α-syn at residue 125 restored the ability of α-syn to fibrillize in the presence of dopamine. Mutagenesis and competition studies with specific synthetic peptides identified α-syn residues 125–129 (i.e. YEMPS) as an important region in the dopamine-induced inhibition of α-syn fibrillization.

In this paper. a yeast amyloid-forming protein Sup35 was used as a model for understanding amyloid fiber formation. The dynamics of amyloid formation by Sup35 were studied with scanning force microscopy. We found that: 1) the assembly of Sup35 fibers begins with individual NM peptides that aggregate to form large beads or nucleation units which. in turn. form dimers. trimers. tetramers and longer linear assemblies appearing as a string of beads; 2) the morphology of the linear assemblies differ; and 3) fiber assembly suggests an analogy to the aggregation of colloidal particles.

Psychotic illness is strongly associated with the maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD) genetic subtype of Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS). but not the deletion subtype (delPWS). This study investigates the clinical features of psychiatric illness associated with PWS. We consider possible genetic and other mechanisms that may be responsible for the development of psychotic illness. predominantly in those with mUPD.Method. The study sample comprised 119 individuals with genetically confirmed PWS. of whom 46 had a history of psychiatric illness. A detailed clinical and family psychiatric history was obtained from these 46 using the PAS-ADD. OPCRIT. Family History and Life Events Questionnaires.Results. Individuals with mUPD had a higher rate of psychiatric illness than those with delPWS (22/34 v. 24/85. p< 0.001). The profile of psychiatric illness in both genetic subtypes resembled an atypical affective disorder with or without psychotic symptoms. Those with delPWS were more likely to have developed a non-psychotic depressive illness (p= 0.005) and those with mUPD a bipolar disorder with psychotic symptoms (p= 0.00005). Individuals with delPWS and psychotic illness had an increased family history of affective disorder. This was confined exclusively to their mothers.Conclusions. Psychiatric illness in PWS is predominately affective with atypical features. The prevalence and possibly the severity of illness are greater in those with mUPD.

The affective psychosis associated with PWS has been found to be mainly confined to the propositi with UPD(15)mat rather than to those with a deletion. This suggests that the psychosis may be related to the presence of two copies rather than a single copy of a gene or genes located in the distal half of the region which is paternally imprinted. but maternally active. and whose loss results in Angelman syndrome (AS). A large population‐based study of PWS allowed the identification of 12 people with a 15q11–q13 deletion who had suffered psychotic episodes and four adults with UPD(15)mat who so far had not. When these people were investigated using microsatellite markers. the 12 …,True,ksp-DNUAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,36,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajmg.a.32212,2767119825217010277,/scholar?cites=2767119825217010277,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Esther_Maina/publication/5527046_In_search_of_the_psychosis_gene_in_people_with_Prader-Willi_syndrome/links/5bebcf24299bf1124fd0f7f4/In-search-of-the-psychosis-gene-in-people-with-Prader-Willi-syndrome.pdf,0,0,0

The current study assesses the potential of Waste Coffee Husks (WCH) in adsorption of crystal violet (CV) dye. Batch experiments were designed to determine the effect of pH. dye concentration. adsorbent dose. and contact time in dye removal. Result revealed that removal of CV was highly favored by lower temperatures and acidic medium. Dye removal per unit mass of WCH increased with increase in contact time. dye concentration and surface area. At ambient temperature. the maximum adsorption efficiency of up to 94% was achieved within 10 min at pH 3. Adsorption capacity of Waste Coffee Husks was found to be 12.0360 mg/l for initial dye concentration of 12.2394 mg/l at 25 °C. The experimental data followed pseudo-second-order kinetic models indicating that dye …,True,ksp-DNUAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,35,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227619306775,4875727166514204876,/scholar?cites=4875727166514204876,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227619306775,0,0,0

Inc.,Lassa virus is a widespread human pathogen in West Africa. Infection can be asymptomatic or result in disease varying from mild influenza-like illness to a severe hemorrhagic fever (HF). Both viral and hostderived factors are involved in the pathogenesis and clinical outcome of the infection in man. Lassa virus belongs to the Old World group of the Arenaviridae which includes the prototypic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) with moderate pathogenic potential and the Mopeia. Mobala and Ippy viruses with mild or unknown pathogenic potentials. The pathogenesis of Lassa HF is not understood. but it has been clearly shown that the well-studied LCMV murine infection is an inappropriate model for arenaviral HF in humans [Peters. 1997; Salvato and Rai. 1998]. Lassa HF has several pathological manifestations in common with other severe viral HFs.

The viral Z protein directly binds to PML and can relocate the nuclear bodies. Others have observed that LCMV virions may contain ribosomes; hence. we investigated the effects of infection on the distribution of ribosomal P proteins (P0. P1. and P2) with PML as a reference point. We demonstrate an association of PML bodies with P proteins by indirect immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. providing the first evidence of nucleic acid-binding proteins associated with PML bodies. We show that unlike PML. the P proteins are not redistributed upon infection. Immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation studies indicate that the viral Z protein binds the nuclear. but not the cytoplasmic. fraction of P0.

It is well known that Tat induces tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). and we show that the majority of TRAIL is produced by the monocyte subset of PBMC. Human monocytes and U937 monoblastoid cells did not take up soluble HIV Tat-86. as T cells did. yet produced more TRAIL than did T cells. TRAIL secretion was induced by Tat and by a cysteine-rich peptide of Tat but not by sulfhydryl-modified Tat toxoid. Although there was only a slight increase in cell surface expression of TRAIL on monocytes. sufficient TRAIL was secreted to be toxic for T cells. The cytotoxicity of Tat-stimulated monocyte medium could be blocked by a TRAIL-neutralizing antibody.

This sensitivity is biologically important because it correlates inversely with the ability of certain LCMV strains to persist in mice (D. Moskophidis. M. Battegay. M. A. Bruendler. E. Laine. I. Gresser. and R. M. Zinkernagel. J. Virol. 68:1951-1955. 1994). The cellular oncoprotein PML is induced by both IFN-α/β and IFN-γ. and PML binds the LCMV Z protein and becomes redistributed within cells from nucleus to cytoplasm upon LCMV infection. In the present study. increased PML expression results in diminished LCMV replication. implicating PML in the IFN sensitivity of LCMV.

Similar to other arenaviruses. the LAS L protein is encoded on the genome-complementary strand and is predicted to be 2218 amino acids in length (253 kDa). It has an unusually large non-coding region adjacent to its translation start site. The LAS L protein contains six motifs of conserved amino acids that have been found among arenavirus L proteins and core RdRp of other segmented negative-stranded (SNS) viruses (Arena-. Bunya- and Orthomyxoviridae). Phylogenetic analyses of the RdRp of 20 SNS viruses reveals that arenavirus L proteins represent a distinct cluster divided into LAS-lymphocytic choriomeningitis and Tacaribe-Pichinde virus lineages.
