Resolution of the antithrombin conformational change contribution …,1992,ST Olson and I Björk and Roberta Sheffer and PA Craig and JD Shore and J Choay,267,Journal of Biological Chemistry,18,12528-12538,Elsevier,The synthetic antithrombin-binding heparin pentasaccharide and a full-length heparin of approximately 26 saccharides containing this specific sequence have been compared with respect to their interactions with antithrombin and their ability to promote inhibition and substrate reactions of antithrombin with thrombin and factor Xa. The aim of these studies was to elucidate the pentasaccharide contribution to heparin's accelerating effect on antithrombin-proteinase reactions. Pentasaccharide and full-length heparins bound antithrombin with comparable high affinities (KD values of 36 +/- 11 and 10 +/- 3 nM. respectively. at I 0.15) and induced highly similar protein fluorescence. ultraviolet and circular dichroism changes in the inhibitor.

1032777,Constitutions. constitutionalism. and the European Union,2001,Paul Craig,7,European Law Journal,2,125-150,Blackwell Publishers Ltd,The institutional reforms of the EU. coupled with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. have fuelled the debate about a European Constitution. This paper begins by examining the nature of constitutions and constitutionalism. The focus then turns to the EU itself. It is argued that the Community has indeed been transformed into a constitutional legal order. and that the arguments to the contrary are not convincing. This does not however mean that the EU has. or should have. a European Constitution cognisable as such which draws together the constitutional articles of the Treaties. together with the constitutional principles articulated by the European Court of Justice. The difficulties with this strategy are examined in detail. and the conclusion is that we should not at present pursue this course.

1032778,Drugs of abuse in saliva: a review,1992,Willfried Schramm and Richard H Smith and Paul A Craig and David A Kidwell,16,,1,1-9,Oxford University Press,There has been substantial interest in the use of saliva as a diagnostic medium for drugs of abuse because it can be obtained noninvasively. Although drugs of abuse have been investigated in saliva for more than a decade. the role of saliva remains uncertain. A clear picture is difficult to obtain because of variations in (1) the analytical methods used; (2) the dose regimen of subjects. which was either unknown or differed between studies; and (3) the elapsed time between drug intake and sample collection. This communication summarizes the studies on the quantitative determination of different drugs of abuse in saliva to elucidate the current status in this area.

The chromatography procedure separated factor Xa from factor X. the Russell's viper venom proteinase used to activate factor X. and traces of contaminating thrombin. α-Factor Xa was unstable at pH 7.6 and 25 °C. undergoing slow proteolytic degradation to functionally heterogeneous products as evidenced by the greater loss of coagulation assay activity compared to activity measured with a chromogenic substrate. The results of monitoring factor Xa degradation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were consistent with proteolysis of the light chain as a major component reaction occurring in parallel with slower proteolysis of the heavy chain.

One explanation for this effect is that hypermutated lesions harbor more tumor-specific neoantigens that stimulate recruitment of an increased number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). which is counterbalanced by overexpression of immune checkpoints such as PD-1 or PD-L1. Given that BRCA1/2-mutated high grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs) exhibit a higher mutational load and a unique mutational signature with an elevated number of larger indels up to 50 bp. we hypothesized that they may also harbor more tumor-specific neoantigens. and. therefore. exhibit increased TILs and PD-1/PD-L1 expression.

The study of different systems related to oxidative stress in these organisms can give important information about their physiological status and also about environmental health. Bivalves have been proposed as good sentinel organisms in pollution monitoring studies through the analysis of biochemical biomarkers. and most of the biomarkers analyzed are those related to oxidative stress. However. it is very important to know how other environmental factors not associated to the presence of pollutants might affect these parameters.

1032842,Free radicals and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases: relevance of dietary antioxidants,2004,Ravindra Pratap Singh and Shashwat Sharad and Suman Kapur,5,J Indian Acad Clin Med,3,218-225,,Cellular antioxidants are known to change their redox state. and they can be targeted for destruction. regulate oxidative processes involved in signal transduction. effect gene expression and pathways of cell proliferation and death. Oxidants and antioxidants play an important role in maintaining a balance between free radicals produced by metabolism or derived from environmental sources and the antioxidant system of the body. A complex natural antioxidant system exists in the biological systems. which is responsible for prevention of damage by pro-oxidants. Impaired endogenous antioxidant system favours accumulation of free radicals. which not only induces the process of lipid peroxidation but also plays a central role in neurodegeneration. The increased incidence of neurodegenerative diseases may be attributed to a pro-oxidative environment caused by smoking. alcohol abuse. UVA and UVB radiations. air pollution as well as inappropriate nutrition. The dependence of disease severity on imbalance between oxidants and natural defences suggests that oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the progression of neurodegeneratve diseases and could serve as a useful target for treatment.It is our attempt to put forth the evidence for involvement of free radicals in pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and the potential of treatment with antioxidants and scavenger substances.

These non-specific channels in the cytoplasmic membrane release osmotically-active solutes and ions. The two major mechanosensitive channels in Escherichia coli are MscL and MscS. Deletion of both proteins severely compromises survival of hypoosmotic shock. However. like many bacteria. E. coli cells possess other MscS-type genes (kefA. ybdG. ybiO. yjeP and ynaI). Two homologs.

Yet. it has remained a riddle how bacteria invade the fungal cells. Genome mining for potential symbiosis factors and functional analyses revealed that a type 2 secretion system (T2SS) of the bacterial endosymbiont is required for the formation of the endosymbiosis. Comparative proteome analyses show that the T2SS releases chitinolytic enzymes (chitinase. chitosanase) and chitin-binding proteins. The genes responsible for chitinolytic proteins and T2SS components are highly expressed during infection. Through targeted gene knock-outs. sporulation assays and microscopic investigations we found that chitinase is essential for bacteria to enter hyphae.

Hydrophobic subunits in previously studied examples have been limited mostly to cycloalkane-derived structures. with cyclohexyl proving to be particularly promising. The present study evaluates alternative hydrophobic subunits that are isomeric or nearly isomeric with the cyclohexyl example; each has four sp3 carbons in the side chains. The results show that varying the substitution pattern of the hydrophobic subunit leads to relatively small changes in antibacterial activity but causes significant changes in hemolytic activity. We hypothesize that these differences in biological activity profile arise. at least in part. from variations among the conformational propensities of the hydrophobic …,True,5xGMUE8AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,123,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja500367u,11000244500573335430,/scholar?cites=11000244500573335430,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ja500367u,0,0,0

Here we demonstrate that one mechanism in this response is the translational repression of TOP mRNAs that encode components of the translational apparatus. This mode of regulation involves TSC and Rheb. as knockout of TSC1 or TSC2 or overexpression of Rheb rescued TOP mRNA translation in oxygen-deprived cells. Stress-induced translational repression of these mRNAs closely correlates with the hypophosphorylated state of 4E-BP. a translational repressor. However. a series of 4E-BP loss- and gain-of-function experiments disprove a cause-and-effect relationship between the phosphorylation status of 4E-BP and the translational repression of TOP mRNAs under oxygen or growth factor deprivation.

HDPs are rich in both hydrophobic and cationic amino acid residues. and most HDP-mimetic polymers have therefore contained binary combinations of hydrophobic and cationic subunits. However. HDP-mimetic polymers rarely duplicate the hydrophobic surface and cationic charge density found among HDPs (Hu. K.; et al. Macromolecules 2013. 46. 1908); the charge and hydrophobicity are generally higher among the polymers. Statistical analysis of HDP sequences (Wang. G.; et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009. 37.

Here we identified a cross-talk between the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation. We discovered that MDC1 binds the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). an E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls the cell cycle. The interaction is direct and is mediated by the tandem BRCA1 C-terminal domains of MDC1 and the C terminus of the Cdc27 (APC3) subunit of the APC/C. It requires the phosphorylation of Cdc27 and is enhanced after induction of DNA damage. We show that the tandem BRCA1 C-terminal domains of MDC1. known to directly bind the phosphorylated form of histone H2AX (γ-H2AX). also bind the APC/C by the same mechanism. as phosphopeptides that correspond to the C termini of γ-H2AX and Cdc27 competed with each other for the binding to MDC1 …,True,5xGMUE8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,53,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820430297,3550460668888660229,/scholar?cites=3550460668888660229,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820430297,0,0,0

This is typically carried out by transmembrane transport proteins that exclude Na+ from the cytosol in exchange for H+. a secondary transport process which is energy-dependent and driven by the proton-motive force generated by plasma-membrane and tonoplast proton pumps. Tonoplast enriched-vesicles from control and 150 mM NaCl-tolerant calli lines were used as a model system to study the activity of V-H+-PPase and V-H+-ATPase and the involvement of Na+ compartmentalization into the vacuole as a mechanism of salt tolerance in Solanum tuberosum.

1032950,Salt stress affects glutamine synthetase activity and mRNA accumulation on potato plants in an organ-dependent manner,2009,Jorge Teixeira and Fernanda Fidalgo,47,Plant Physiology and Biochemistry,9,807-813,Elsevier Masson,Ammonium assimilation into glutamine and glutamate is vital for plant growth as these are precursors for almost all nitrogenous compounds. Ammonium can be assimilated onto nitrogenous organic compounds by the concerted action of two enzymes that compose the glutamine synthetase (GS. EC 6.3.1.2) – glutamate synthase (Fd-GOGAT. EC 1.4.7.1; NADH–GOGAT. EC 1.4.1.14) cycle. Ammonium may also be directly incorporated into glutamate by the glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH. EC 1.4.1.2) aminating reaction. However. as GDH reversibly deaminates glutamate. its physiological role in vivo remains controversial. Potato has been classified as moderately tolerant to salinity. Potato GS is encoded by a small multigene family which is differentially regulated in an organ and age-dependent way.

Traditionally. myosins have been classified by sequence analysis into a large number of sub-families (∼35). Here we use a different method to classify the myosin family members which is based on biochemical and mechanical properties. The key properties that define the type of mechanical activity of the motor are duty ratio (defined as the fraction of the time myosin remains attached to actin during each cycle). thermodynamic coupling of actin and nucleotide binding to myosin and the degree of strain-sensitivity of the ADP release step. Based on these properties we propose to classify myosins into four different groups: (I) fast movers. (II) slow/efficient force holders.

To understand its regulatory mechanism. we have determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal truncated human SHP-1 in the inactive conformation at 2.8-Å resolution and refined the structure to a crystallographic R-factor of 24.0%. The three-dimensional structure shows that the ligand-free SHP-1 has an auto-inhibited conformation. Its N-SH2 domain blocks the catalytic domain and keeps the enzyme in the inactive conformation. which supports that the phosphatase activity of SHP-1 is primarily regulated by the N-SH2 domain.

A Wiley Company,Cavities within proteins that are strictly apolar typically appear to be empty. It has been suggested. however. that water molecules may be present within such cavities but are too disordered to be seen in conventional crystallographic analyses. In contrast. it is argued here that solvent mobility will be limited by the size of the cavity and for this reason high‐occupancy solvent in cavities of typical volume should be readily detectable using X‐ray crystallography. Recent experimental studies of cavity hydration are reviewed. Such studies are consistent with theoretical predictions that it is energetically unfavorable to have a single water molecule in an apolar cavity. As apolar cavities become larger. a point is reached where it is favorable to have the cavity occupied by a cluster of mutually H‐bonded water molecules.

HER3 is a catalytically impaired member of the HER family that contributes to the development of several human malignancies and is mutated in a subset of cancers. HER3 signaling depends on heterodimerization with a catalytically active partner. in particular epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (the founding family member. also known as HER1) or HER2.

Aspartate racemase is a representative pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-independent amino acid racemase. The “two-base” catalytic mechanism has been proposed for this type of racemase. in which a pair of cysteine residues are utilized as the conjugated catalytic acid and base. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of aspartate racemase from the hyperthermophilic archaeum Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 at 1.9 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography and refined it to a crystallographic R factor of 19.4% (Rfree of 22.2%).

The mechanism by which the domains are allosterically coupled is not well understood. Using an in vivo assay. we found that the interdomain linker that connects the VSD to the PD is essential for coupling the full-length protein. Biochemical assays showed that the linker is also needed for activity in the isolated PD. We also identified a late step of VSD motion in the full-length protein that depends on the linker. Notably. we found that this VSD motion requires PI (4. 5) P 2. a substrate of Ci-VSP. These results suggest that the voltage-driven motion of the VSD turns the enzyme on by rearranging the linker into an activated conformation. and that this activated conformation is stabilized by PI (4. 5) P 2.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,SHP‐1 belongs to the family of non‐receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and generally acts as a negative regulator in a variety of cellular signaling pathways. Previously. the crystal structures of the tail‐truncated SHP‐1 and SHP‐2 revealed an autoinhibitory conformation. To understand the regulatory mechanism of SHP‐1. we have determined the crystal structure of the full‐length SHP‐1 at 3.1 Å. Although the tail was disordered in current structure. the huge conformational rearrangement of the N‐SH2 domain and the incorporation of sulfate ions into the ligand‐binding site of each domain indicate that the SHP‐1 is in the open conformation. The N‐SH2 domain in current structure is shifted away from the active site of the PTP domain to the other side of the C‐SH2 domain. resulting in exposure of the active site.

Results are in keeping with the concept that irreversible oxidation of protein sulfhydryls is more extensive in aged tissue samples.

In addition to the kinase domain. Itk is composed of several noncatalytic regulatory domains. including a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain that contains a conformationally heterogeneous Pro residue. Cis-trans isomerization of a single prolyl imide bond within the SH2 domain mediates conformer-specific ligand recognition that may have functional implications in T cell signaling. To better understand the mechanism by which a proline switch regulates ligand binding. we have used NMR spectroscopy to determine two structures of Itk SH2 corresponding to the cis and trans imide bond-containing conformers.

In this re-port. we examine the mechanisms of oxidative dam-age to the two reactive sulfhydryls of carbonic anhy-drase III. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). peroxy radicals. or hypochlorous acid (HOCl) produced irreversibly oxidized forms. primarily cysteine sulfinic acid or cys-teic acid. of carbonic anhydrase III if glutathione (GSH) was not present. When GSH was approximate-ly equimolar to protein thiols. irreversible oxidation was prevented. H2O2 and peroxyl radicals both gener-ated S-glutathiolated carbonic anhydrase III via par-tially oxidized protein sulfhydryl intermediates. while HOCl did not cause S-glutathiolation. Thus. oxidative damage from H2O2 or AAPH was prevented by protein S-glutathiolation. while a direct reaction between GSH and oxidant likely prevents HOCl-mediated pro-tein damage. In cultured rat hepatocytes. carbonic anhydrase III was rapidly S-glutathiolated by mena-dione. When hepatocyte glutathione was depleted. menadione instead caused irreversible oxidation. We hypothesized that normal depletion of glutathione in aged animals might also lead to an increase in irre-versible oxidation. Indeed. both total protein extracts and carbonic anhydrase III contained significantly more cysteine sulfinic acid in older rats compared to young animals.

Electrostatic charge and steric contacts at each modification site inversely correlate with the relative rates of reactivity of these cysteines toward glutathione (GSH). Diffuse electron density associated with the GSH adducts suggests a lack of preferred bonding interactions between CAIII and the glutathionyl moieties.

This report examines the effect of S-nitrosothiols on the low-molecular-weight thiols and protein thiols in NIH/3T3 cells. A low concentration of S-nitrosocysteine increased the cysteine content of the cells. with no evidence of either low-molecular-weight thiol or protein S-nitrosylation. Millimolar amounts of S-nitrosocysteine produced S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). cysteinyl glutathione. cysteine. and glutathione disulfide.

However. the complexity of biology makes it difficult to predict the extent to which such efforts will succeed. As a first practical example. the Registry of Standard Biological Parts started at MIT now maintains and distributes thousands of BioBrick™ standard biological parts. However. BioBrick parts are only standardized in terms of how individual parts are physically assembled into multi-component systems. and most parts remain uncharacterized. Standardized tools. techniques. and units of measurement are needed to facilitate the characterization and reuse of parts by independent researchers across many laboratories. We found that the absolute activity of BioBrick promoters varies across experimental conditions and measurement instruments. We choose one promoter (BBa_J23101) to serve as an in vivo reference standard for promoter activity. We demonstrated that. by measuring the activity of promoters relative to BBa_J23101. we could reduce variation in reported promoter activity due to differences in test conditions and measurement instruments by ~50%. We defined a Relative Promoter Unit (RPU) in order to report promoter characterization data in compatible units and developed a measurement kit so that researchers might more easily adopt RPU as a standard unit for reporting promoter activity.

In single particle cryo-EM. the central problem is to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of a macromolecule from 104− 7 noisy and randomly oriented two-dimensional projections. However. the imaged protein complexes may exhibit structural variability. which complicates reconstruction and is typically addressed using discrete clustering approaches that fail to capture the full range of protein dynamics. Here. we introduce a novel method for cryo-EM reconstruction that extends naturally to modeling continuous generative factors of structural heterogeneity. This method encodes structures in Fourier space using coordinatebased deep neural networks. and trains these networks from unlabeled 2D cryo-EM images by combining exact inference over image orientation with variational inference for structural heterogeneity. We demonstrate that the proposed method. termed cryoDRGN. can perform ab initio reconstruction of 3D protein complexes from simulated and real 2D cryo-EM image data. To our knowledge. cryoDRGN is the first neural network-based approach for cryo-EM reconstruction and the first end-to-end method for directly reconstructing continuous ensembles of protein structures from cryo-EM images.,True,DjR64IwAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC,55,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4286727439560558886&hl=en&oi=scholarr,9189609691306158026,/scholar?cites=9189609691306158026,,,0,0,0

We screened a diverse chemical collection that included previously approved drugs for compounds that induced cold sensitive growth inhibition in the model bacterium Escherichia coli. Among the most cold sensitive was lamotrigine. an anticonvulsant drug. Lamotrigine treatment resulted in the rapid accumulation of immature 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits at 15°C. Importantly. this was not the result of translation inhibition. as lamotrigine was incapable of perturbing protein synthesis in vivo or in vitro. Spontaneous suppressor mutations blocking lamotrigine activity mapped solely to the poorly characterized domain II of translation initiation factor IF2 and prevented the binding of lamotrigine to IF2 in vitro.

Because SRNF does not involve phase transition. this process can potentially decrease the energy consumption and solvent waste and increase the yield of active components. Such improvements could significantly benefit a number of fields. such as pharmaceutical manufacturing and catalysis recovery. among others. Therefore. SRNF has gained a lot of attention since the recent introduction of solvent‐stable polymeric materials in the manufacture of nanofiltration membranes.

1033099,Medicinal benefits of coriander (Coriandrum sativum L),2011,Ullagaddi Rajeshwari and Bondada Andallu,1,Spatula DD,1,51-58,,Medicinal plants have therapeutic potential due to the presence of natural antioxidants functioning as reducing agents. free radical scavengers and quenchers of singlet oxygen. Majority of their antioxidant activity is due to bioactive compounds viz. flavones. isoflavones. flavonoids. anthocyanins. coumarins. lignans. catechins and isocatechins. Currently there has been an increasing interest to identify the antioxidants that are pharmacologically potent with low or no side effects for use in preventive medicine. Spices have been recognized to possess several medicinal properties (diuretic. expectorant. laxative. anti-bacterial. anti-pyretic etc.) and have been effectively used in the indigenous systems of medicine in India and other countries. Apart from the traditional use. a no. of beneficial physiological effects have been identified by extensive animal studies. Among these are their beneficial effects on lipid metabolism. efficiency as antidiabetics. ability to stimulate digestion and to inhibit platelet aggregation. antioxidant. antilithogenic and anti-inflammatory potential. Many spices and their active principles are reported as excellent nutraceuticals. Coriander is among such most commonly used spices. possessing the nutritional as well as medicinal properties. widely distributed and mainly cultivated for the seeds which contain an essential oil and the monoterpenoid-linalool.

Recently. the circadian clock has been shown to affect plant responses to biotic cues. To further examine this role of the circadian clock. we tested disease resistance in mutants disrupted in CCA1 and LHY. which act synergistically to regulate clock activity. We found that cca1 and lhy mutants also synergistically affect basal and resistance gene-mediated defense against Pseudomonas syringae and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Disrupting the circadian clock caused by overexpression of CCA1 or LHY also resulted in severe susceptibility to P. syringae. We identified a downstream target of CCA1 and LHY. GRP7. a key constituent of a slave oscillator regulated by the circadian clock and previously shown to influence plant defense and stomatal activity. We show that the defense role of CCA1 and LHY against P. syringae is at least partially through circadian control of stomatal aperture but is independent of defense mediated by salicylic acid. Furthermore. we found defense activation by P. syringae infection and treatment with the elicitor flg22 can feedback-regulate clock activity.

To better understand the details of the how these enzymes bind and hydrolyze carbapenems. we have determined the structures of two deacylation-deficient variants (K84D and V130D) of the class D carbapenemase OXA-24 with doripenem bound as a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate. Doripenem adopts essentially the same configuration in both OXA-24 variant structures. but varies significantly when compared to the non-carbapenemase class D member OXA-1/doripenem complex.

As a first step toward identifying the key functional domain(s) on the Rho-subtype GDI. truncations of the amino and carboxyl termini were performed. Deletion of the final four amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of Rho GDI or the removal of 25 amino acids from the amino terminus had no significant effect on the ability of the GDI to inhibit GDP dissociation from the Rho-like protein Cdc42Hs or on its ability to release Cdc42Hs from membrane bilayers. However. the deletion of 8 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of Rho GDI eliminated both activities.

Insights into the mechanism of Hfq action have come from a variety of approaches. A key finding was the characterization of two RNA binding sites: the Proximal Site. which binds sRNA and mRNA; and the Distal Site. which binds poly(A) tails. Hfq was shown to interact with PAP I. PNP and RNase E. proteins that are involved in mRNA decay and in vitro. was shown to form fibres. the physiological significance of which is unknown.

Relatives of FtsK are present in most bacteria; in Bacillus subtilis. the FtsK orthologue. SpoIIIE. transfers the majority of a chromosome into the forespore during sporulation. DNA translocase activity is contained within a ~ 512-amino-acid C-terminal domain. which is divided into three subdomains: α. β and γ. α and β comprise the translocation motor. and γ is a regulatory domain that interacts with DNA and with the XerD recombinase. In vitro rates of translocation of ~ 5 kb·s−1 have been measured for both FtsK and SpoIIIE. whereas. in vivo. SpoIIIE has a comparable rate of translocation.

The recombination reaction is catalyzed by four monomers of Flp bound to two separate. but identical. recombination sites (FRT sites) and occurs in two sequential pairs of strand exchanges. The relative orientation of the two recombination sites during synapsis was examined. Topoisomerase relaxation and nick ligation were used to detect topological nodes introduced by the synapse prior to the chemical steps of recombination. A single negative supercoil was found to be trapped by Flp in substrates with inverted FRT sites whereas no trapped supercoils were observed with direct repeats.

Whereas replication links are removed primarily by topoisomerase IV. XerC/XerD-dif site-specific recombination can mediate sister chromosome unlinking in Topoisomerase IV-deficient cells. This reaction is activated at the division septum by the DNA translocase FtsK. which coordinates the last stages of chromosome segregation with cell division. It has been proposed that. after being activated by FtsK. XerC/XerD-dif recombination removes DNA links in a stepwise manner.

[3H[apomorphine was prepared and tested for dopamine-like binding properties in both calf and human brain tissues. Specific binding of [3H]apomorphine was defined as that binding which occurred in the presence of 1 muM (-)-butaclamol (an inactive neuroleptic) minus that occurring in the presence of 1 muM (+)-butaclamol (active neuroleptic). The specific binding was saturable. the number of sites being double that of specific [3H]dopamine binding. and occurred primarily in dopamine-rich regions of postmortem human brains. The binding had a dissociation constant of 0.9 nM for human caudate (2 nM for calf caudate) and was blocked by dopamine and norepinephrine. but not by isoproterenol or (-)-propranolol. distinguishing it from a beta-adrenergic receptor.

Elsevier, Amsterdam",,131-145,,The criterion of stereoselectivity refers to the fact that non-specific actions on the membrane primarily depend on the fat solubility of the drug. and there is very little difference between stereoisomers in producing such effects. The nanomolar concentration criterion for specific neuroleptic action refers to the fact that the therapeutic concentrations of the neuro-leptics in plasma water are between 0.1 and 50 nm. Hence. of the many neuroleptic sites proposed. only those affected by nanomolar concentrations (up to 100 nM) would have any likelihood of being truly specific. 2. NON-SPECIFIC SITES OF NEUROLEPTIC ACTION OF MEMBRANES: Since the neuroleptics are highly fat-soluble (46. 18. 43) and surface-active (47. 45. 33). they readily partition into biomembranes (see Table 1). Because of these high concentrations in the membrane phase. it is reasonable to expect that neuroleptics interfere with a wide variety of membrane-associated events (46. 59). It is also likely that some of the membrane sites are the primary targets mediating the therapeutic actions of neuro-leptics.,True,7VchCQkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,8,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13687994346049061074&hl=en&oi=scholarr,13687994346049061074,/scholar?cites=13687994346049061074,,,0,0,0

However. the performance of such sensors is significantly influenced by the morphology and structure of sensing materials. resulting in a great obstacle for gas sensors based on bulk materials or dense films to achieve highly-sensitive properties. Lots of metal oxide nanostructures have been developed to improve the gas sensing properties such as sensitivity. selectivity. response speed. and so on. Here. we provide a brief overview of metal oxide nanostructures and their gas sensing properties from the aspects of particle size. morphology and doping. When the particle size of metal oxide is close to or less than double thickness of the space-charge layer. the sensitivity of the sensor will increase remarkably. which would be called “small size effect”. yet small size of metal oxide nanoparticles will be compactly sintered together during the film coating process which is disadvantage for gas diffusion in them. In view of those reasons. nanostructures with many kinds of shapes such as porous nanotubes. porous nanospheres and so on have been investigated. that not only possessed large surface area and relatively mass reactive sites. but also formed relatively loose film structures which is an advantage for gas diffusion. Besides. doping is also an effective method to decrease particle size and improve gas sensing properties.

The quite varied pheromones. which have been identified from female moths of nearly 530 species from around the world. are classified into groups of Type I (75%). Type II (15%). and miscellaneous (10%). according to their chemical structures. Additionally. many pheromones produced by male moths and butterflies have been known. While new sex pheromones from about 70 lepidopteran species have been reported in the last five years utilizing GC-EAD. GC-MS.

In the present study. we used the LCMV model to evaluate the anti-viral potential of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides against arenaviruses. Our findings indicate that amphipathic DNA polymers (APs) are potent inhibitors of infection with a series of LCMV isolates with IC50 in the low nanomolar range. APs target the surface glycoprotein (GP) of LCMV and block viral entry and cell–cell propagation of the virus. without affecting later steps in replication or release of progeny virus from infected cells. The anti-viral action of APs is sequence-independent but is critically dependent on their size and hydrophobicity.

The unresolved mechanistic strategy by which RecA aligns a single strand of DNA with a duplex DNA and mediates a DNA strand switch is central to understanding homologous recombination. We explored the mechanism of RecA‐mediated DNA‐strand exchange using oligonucleotide substrates with the intrinsic fluorophore 6‐methylisoxanthopterin. Pre‐steady‐state spectrofluorometric analysis elucidated the earliest transient intermediates formed during recombination and delineated the mechanistic strategy by which RecA facilitates this process.

After assembly the spliceosome is activated for catalysis by rearrangement of subunits to form an active site. How this rearrangement is coordinated is not well-understood. During activation. U4 must be released to allow U6 conformational change. while Prp19 complex (NTC) recruitment is essential for stabilizing the active site. We used multi-wavelength colocalization single molecule spectroscopy to directly observe the key events in Saccharomyces cerevisiae spliceosome activation. Following binding of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP. the spliceosome either reverses assembly by discarding tri-snRNP or proceeds to activation by irreversible U4 loss. The major pathway for NTC recruitment occurs after U4 release. ATP stimulates both the competing U4 release and tri-snRNP discard processes. The data reveal the activation mechanism and show that overall splicing efficiency may be maintained through repeated rounds of disassembly and tri-snRNP reassociation.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14166.001,True,c96uHT8AAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,32,https://elifesciences.org/articles/14166,11294512101682389284,/scholar?cites=11294512101682389284,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/14166.pdf,0,0,0

To examine the effects of ELAP in vivo. male Sprague Dawley rats were given intraperitoneal injections of vehicle 10% Tween-20. 5 mL/kg (normal control) or 200 mg/kg TAA thioacetamide (to induce liver cirrhosis) three times per week. Three additional groups were treated with thioacetamide plus daily oral silymarin (50 mg/kg) or ELAP (250 or 500 mg/kg). Liver injury was assessed using biochemical tests. macroscopic and microscopic tissue analysis. histopathology. and immunohistochemistry. In addition. HepG2 and WRL-68 cells were treated in vitro with ELAP fractions to test cytotoxicity.

RYB-a is a 31 kDa protein that contains a conserved cold-shock domain and an amino acid alignment similar to those of charge zipper proteins. Expression of RYB-a mRNA was highly abundant in the skeletal muscle. spleen. and fetal liver. The expression is very low in new-born and adult livers. suggesting its expression is under developmental regulation. In addition. the expression of RYB-a mRNA was induced in the liver during regeneration and by stimulation of quiescent fibroblast cells with serum. Induction in the fibroblasts was inhibited by treating the cell with a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor. genistein or by detachment of cell-adhesion.

Deletion of the half of this promoter distal to its origin reduced its ability for tissue-specific expression. Two protein-binding sites in this distal element have been identified and characterized. One bound a factor named AIF-A. which is probably identical to previously characterized liver-specific factors HNF-1 and APF. The other. containing a CCAAT motif. bound a factor named AIF-B. These two factors were considerably enriched in liver cells compared with other cells not expressing AldB. In the liver. these two factors increased prior to the activation of the AldB gene during development. Liver-specific in vitro transcription assays indicated that the binding of both factors to their target sequences was required for AldB transcription.

Sci,,153-159,,Nitrilases are important industrial enzymes that convert nitriles into their corresponding acids or. occasionally. amides. Atomic resolution structures of four members of the nitrilase superfamily have been determined. but these differ from microbial nitrilases in that they do not form typical large homo-oligomeric complexes. At least two nitrilases. the cyanide dihydratases from Pseudomonas stutzeri AK61 and Bacillus pumilus C1. form unusual spiral structures of 14 and 18 subunits. respectively. Evidence suggests that the formation of the spiral structure is essential for activity. Sequence analysis reveals that the nitrilases differ from the nonspiral-forming homologs by two insertions of between 12 and 14 amino acids and a C-terminal extension of up to 35 amino acids. The insertions are positioned at an intermolecular interface in the spiral and probably contribute to its formation. The other interfaces responsible for the formation and/or stabilization of the spirals can also be identified. Comparative structure modeling enables identification of the residues involved in these interacting surfaces. which are remote from the active site. Mutation of these interacting residues usually leads to loss of activity. The effect of the mutations on activity in most cases can be rationalized in terms of a possible effect on spiral formation.,True,ykBN_6kAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,34,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Benedik/publication/7383055_Oligomeric_Structure_of_Nitrilases_Effect_of_Mutating_Interfacial_Residues_on_Activity/links/09e41509c81a1aabd3000000/Oligomeric-Structure-of-Nitrilases-Effect-of-Mutating-Interfacial-Residues-on-Activity.pdf,13732250530465696953,/scholar?cites=13732250530465696953,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Benedik/publication/7383055_Oligomeric_Structure_of_Nitrilases_Effect_of_Mutating_Interfacial_Residues_on_Activity/links/09e41509c81a1aabd3000000/Oligomeric-Structure-of-Nitrilases-Effect-of-Mutating-Interfacial-Residues-on-Activity.pdf,0,0,0

The selectivity filter is the functional unit that allows K+ channels to distinguish potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) ions. The filter9s structure depends on whether K+ or Na+ ions are bound inside it. We synthesized a K+ channel containing the d-enantiomer of alanine in place of a conserved glycine and found by x-ray crystallography that its filter maintains the K+ (conductive) structure in the presence of Na+ and very low concentrations of K+. This channel conducts Na+ in the absence of K+ but not in the presence of K+.

This enzyme (RS kinase) specifically phosphorylates arginine-serine dipeptide motifs located at the NH2-terminal domain of LBR and regulates its interactions with other nuclear envelope proteins. To compare the phosphorylation state of LBR during interphase and mitosis. we performed phosphopeptide mapping of in vitro and in vivo 32P-labeled LBR and analyzed a series of recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides. Our results show that LBR undergoes two types of mitotic phosphorylation mediated by the RS and the p34cdc2 protein kinases. respectively.

Data in cellular systems support the dependence of TRPV1 activity on phosphoinositides. The purified TRPV1. however. was recently shown to be fully functional in artificial liposomes in the absence of phosphoinositides. Here. we show that several other negatively charged phospholipids. including phosphatidylglycerol. can also support TRPV1 activity in excised patches at high concentrations. When we incorporated TRPV1 into planar lipid bilayers consisting of neutral lipids. capsaicin-induced activity depended on phosphatidylinositol 4.5-bisphosphate.

LLC,The cold and menthol receptor TRPM8 is highly expressed in prostate and prostate cancer (PC). Recently. we identified that TRPM8 is as an ionotropic testosterone receptor. The TRPM8 mRNA is expressed in early prostate tumors with high androgen levels. while anti-androgen therapy greatly reduces its expression. Here. from the chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. we found that an androgen response element (ARE) mediates androgen regulation of trpm8. Furthermore. using immunofluorescence. calcium-imaging and planar lipid bilayers. we identified that TRPM8 channel is functionally regulated by androgens in the prostate.

The emergence of hypervirulent and multidrug-resistant strains has further amplified public health concern and accentuated the need for new classes of antibiotics. RNA degradation is a required cellular process that could be exploited for novel antimicrobial drug development. However. such discovery efforts have been hindered because components of the Gram-positive RNA turnover machinery are incompletely defined. In the current study we found that the essential S. aureus protein. RnpA. catalyzes rRNA and mRNA digestion in vitro. Exploiting this activity. high through-put and secondary screening assays identified a small molecule inhibitor of RnpA-mediated in vitro RNA degradation. This agent was shown to limit cellular mRNA degradation and exhibited antimicrobial activity against predominant methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) lineages circulating throughout the U.S.. vancomycin intermediate susceptible S. aureus (VISA). vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VRSA) and other Gram-positive bacterial pathogens with high RnpA amino acid conservation. We also found that this RnpA-inhibitor ameliorates disease in a systemic mouse infection model and has antimicrobial activity against biofilm-associated S. aureus.

Although PCSK9 is expressed mainly in the liver. it is present also in other tissues and organs with specific functions. raising the question of whether a pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9 to treat hypercholesterolaemia and associated cardiovascular diseases might be helpful or deleterious in non-hepatic tissues. For example. PCSK9 is expressed in the vascular wall. in the kidneys. and in the brain. where it was proposed to play a role in development. neurocognitive process. and neuronal apoptosis.

In the sub-chronic study. the extract administered daily for a period of 28 days showed no mortality or morbidity and the relative weights of organs were not affected by the treatment. However. significant weight gain in both treated and control group was observed. Indicators of liver damage such as alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST). as well as total serum protein and albumin showed no significant alteration in the extract treated animals when compared with the controls at all doses used. The extracts caused a significant (p< 0.05) decrease in the activity of gamma glutamy transferase (ƔGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) when compared with the control. However. the extract did not have any significant effect on markers of kidney function or hematological parameters in the rats. except in the female rats where a significant increase (p< 0.05) in lymphocytes counts at 500 mg/kg was observed. Histopathological examination of the liver revealed no detectable inflammation.

Phosphatase treatment of mouse cell extracts reduced the number of Hop isoforms compared to untreated extracts. providing the first direct evidence that Hop was phosphorylated in vivo. Furthermore. surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy showed that a cdc2 kinase phosphorylation mimic of Hop had reduced affinity for Hsp90 binding. Hop was predominantly cytoplasmic. but translocated to the nucleus in response to heat shock.

Here we demonstrate that a synthetic peptide identical to the C-terminus (amino acids 99–126) of the rat atrial natriuretic peptide (rANP) modulates osmotically induced swelling of mesophyll cell protoplasts (MCPs) in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Osmotically-induced volume changes in MCPs are enhanced by plant extracts with NP immunoreactivity and this effect is concentration-dependent. In contrast. pre-treatment of the plant extracts with rabbit anti-human ANP (99–126) antiserum suppresses enhanced osmoticum-induced swelling. Isolated plant peptides (irPNP) that have been immunoaffinity purified with rabbit anti-human ANP (99–126) antiserum also enhance osmotically-induced swelling.

The present study was aimed at determining the sperm quality and morphological alterations of sperm cells at the dose mentioned and to confirm the anti fertility activity of the plant extract by mating experiments. Results showed that the extract induced alterations of sperm morphology was predominantly of primary abnormalities (40%). which include hook less. banana head. pin head. bent neck. bent tail. head amorphous and presence of cytoplasmic droplets. About 10% secondary abnormalities were found to have coiled tail or head less spermatozoa. The tertiary abnormalities (8%) ie. tailless or detached head and simple coil tail were also found. Morphological changes in plasma membrane of spermatozoa were further confirmed by SEM study. Presence of cytoplasmic droplets and disruption of plasma membrane of spermatozoa in treated group also confirm the potentiality of this plant extract as an anti fertility agent.

Here. we examined the processive motility of mammalian dynein complexed with dynactin and BicD2 (DDB) on tyrosinated versus detyrosinated microtubules. Motility was decreased ~fourfold on detyrosinated microtubules. constituting the largest effect of a tubulin PTM on motor function observed to date.

POLQ participates in end joining of a DNA break during immunoglobulin class-switching. producing insertions of base pairs at the joins with homology to IgH switch-region sequences. Biochemical experiments with purified human POLQ protein revealed the mechanism generating the insertions during DNA end joining. relying on the unique ability of POLQ to extend DNA from minimally paired primers. DNA breaks at the IgH locus can sometimes join with breaks in Myc. creating a chromosome translocation. We found a marked increase in Myc/IgH translocations in Polq-defective mice. showing that POLQ suppresses genomic instability and genome rearrangements originating at DNA double-strand breaks. This work clearly defines a role and mechanism for mammalian POLQ in an alternative end joining pathway that suppresses the formation of …,True,EILjtnMAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,148,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004654,14321779316243728738,/scholar?cites=14321779316243728738,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004654,0,0,0

Bisphosphorylation of TnI reduces the affinity of the regulatory site on troponin C (TnC) for Ca2+ by increasing the rate of Ca2+ dissociation. What remains unclear is how the phosphorylation signal is transmitted from one subunit of troponin to another. We have produced a series of mutations in the N-terminal extension of TnI designed to further our understanding of the mechanisms involved. The ability of phosphorylation of the mutant TnIs to affect Ca2+ sensitivity has been assessed. We find that the Pro residues found in a conserved (Xaa-Pro)4 motif N-terminal to the phosphorylation sites are not required for the effect of the N-terminal extension on Ca2+ binding in the presence or absence of phosphorylation.

This prevents contamination of sample tubes with additives from previous tubes that could cause erroneous results. There have been a number of studies recently looking at whether order of draw remains a problem with modern phlebotomy techniques and materials. or it is an outdated practice followed simply because of historical reasons.

In principle. this assay makes use of the oxidative capacity of lipid peroxides to convert iodide to iodine. which can be measured photometrically at 365 nm. Calibration curves were obtained using peroxides such as H2O2. t-butyl hydroperoxide. and cumene hydroperoxide. A stoichiometric relationship was observed between the amount of organic peroxides assayed and the concentration of iodine produced. Concentrations of lipid peroxides as small as 1 nmol/ml could be measured.

Using FRET. we establish the presence of GCase/sapC and GCase/product contacts in the bilayer.

These structures are composed of microfilaments and cytoplasm. covered by plasma membrane. Epithelial cell function is usually coupled to the density of microvilli and its individual size illustrated by diseases. in which microvilli degradation causes malabsorption and diarrhea. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been widely used to study the topography and morphology of living cells. Visualizing soft and flexible structures such as microvilli on the apical surface of a live cell has been very challenging because the native microvilli structures are displaced and deformed by the interaction with the probe.

To comprehensively and accurately elucidate key processes of nicotine degradation in Pseudomonas putida. we measured differential protein abundance levels with MS-based spectral counting in P. putida S16 grown on nicotine or glycerol. a non-repressive carbon source. In silico analyses highlighted significant clustering of proteins involved in a functional pathway in nicotine degradation. The transcriptional regulation of differentially expressed genes was analyzed by using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. We observed the following key results: (i) The proteomes. containing 1.292 observed proteins. provide a detailed view of enzymes involved in nicotine metabolism. These proteins could be assigned to the functional groups of transport. detoxification. and amino acid metabolism. There were significant differences in the cytosolic protein patterns of cells growing in a nicotine medium and those in a glycerol medium.

Ligand binding converts the receptor to a dimeric form. in which contacts are restricted to the receptor itself. allowing heterodimerization of the four EGFR family members without direct ligand involvement. Activation of the receptor depends on the formation of an asymmetric dimer of kinase domains. in which one kinase domain allosterically activates the other.

RasGRP1 is important in some cancers and autoimmune diseases but. in contrast to SOS. its regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Activating signals lead to the membrane recruitment of RasGRP1 and Ras engagement. but it is unclear how interactions between RasGRP1 and Ras are suppressed in the absence of such signals. We present a crystal structure of a fragment of RasGRP1 in which the Ras-binding site is blocked by an interdomain linker and the membrane-interaction surface of RasGRP1 is hidden within a dimerization interface that may be stabilized by the C-terminal oligomerization domain. NMR data demonstrate that calcium binding to the regulatory module generates substantial conformational changes that are incompatible with the inactive assembly.

We show that the human CaMKII holoenzyme exists in dodecameric and tetradecameric forms. and that the calmodulin (CaM)-binding element of CaMKII can bind to the hub of the holoenzyme and destabilize it to release dimers. The structures of CaMKII from two distantly diverged organisms suggest that the CaM-binding element of activated CaMKII acts as a wedge by docking at intersubunit interfaces in the hub. This converts the hub into a spiral form that can release or gain CaMKII dimers.

In this research. granulation of nitrifying bacteria in an aerobic upflow fluidized bed (AUFB) reactor in a nitrification process for inorganic wastewater containing 500 g/m3 of NH4+-N was investigated. It was observed that spherical. pseudocubic and elliptical granules with a diameter of 346 μm were produced at the bottom of the reactor after 300 days. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that Nitrosomonas-like bacteria were the dominant ammonia-oxidizing species in the granules. Many colonies of Nitrosomonas-like bacteria were found in the outer part of the granules based on the spatial distribution analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

It is thus important to develop technology that can suppress N2O emission. The effects of sludge retention time (SRT) and dissolved oxygen (DO) on N2O emission in an anoxic-oxic activated sludge system were estimated. Moreover. the microbial community structure in the sludge. which plays an important role in N2O suppression. was clarified based on nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) gene analysis by molecular biological techniques. The results showed that under low SRT conditions. nitrification efficiency was reduced and the N2O emission rate in the oxic reactors was increased.

Furthermore. ectopic expression of Sp1 deletion mutants in SL2 cells demonstrates that both the Sp1‐mediated repression and activation require the D transactivation domain of Sp1 bound to the Cbox.

In prometaphase. the CPC is enriched at the centromeres to regulate the spindle checkpoint and kinetochore-microtubule interactions. Centromeric CPC binds to histone H3 that is phosphorylated at T3 (H3T3ph) by Aurora B-stimulated Haspin [2. 3. 4. 5]. PP1/Repo-Man acts antagonistically to Haspin and dephosphorylates H3T3ph at the chromosome arms but is somehow prevented from causing a net dephosphorylation of centromeric H3T3ph during prometaphase [6. 7]. Here. we show that Aurora B phosphorylates Repo-Man at S893. preventing its recruitment by histones. We also identify PP2A as a mitotic interactor of Repo-Man that dephosphorylates S893 and thereby promotes the targeting of Repo-Man to chromosomes and the …,True,42pV4DkAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,79,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213005800,7025470726453464322,/scholar?cites=7025470726453464322,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213005800,0,0,0

We previously showed that Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription is regulated by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1). In the present study we demonstrate that Tat interacts with PP1 and that disruption of this interaction prevents induction of HIV-1 transcription.

1033663,Spindle checkpoint silencing: PP1 tips the balance,2011,Bart Lesage and Junbin Qian and Mathieu Bollen,21,,21,R898-R903,Cell Press,The spindle checkpoint is a mitotic surveillance mechanism that delays anaphase until all sister chromatids are correctly attached to microtubules from opposite poles. Recent studies reveal that protein kinase Aurora B is a key regulator of spindle checkpoint activation whereas protein phosphatase PP1 antagonizes Aurora B and induces checkpoint silencing. Chromosome biorientation stretches the kinetochores and spatially separates centromeric Aurora B from its kinetochore substrates. comprising several PP1-interacting proteins (PIPs). The ensuing dephosphorylation of these PIPs creates docking sites for the bulk recruitment of PP1 to the kinetochores. We propose that this tension-induced targeting of PP1 triggers checkpoint silencing by the dephosphorylation of kinetochore and checkpoint components. including Aurora B substrates. In addition.

The stability of the complex depended on functional PP1 interaction sites in Sds22 and I3. indicating that PP1 is sandwiched between Sds22 and I3. Intriguingly. I3 could not be replaced in this complex by another PP1 interactor with the same PP1 binding motif. In vitro. Sds22 and I3 were potent inhibitors of PP1. but with only some substrates. The inhibition by Sds22 could be reproduced with synthetic Sds22 fragments comprising leucine-rich repeats (LRR) 2 and 5.

Mutagenesis of a cSH2 contact residue activates downstream signaling in cells. This inhibitory contact ties up the C-terminal region of the p110β catalytic subunit. which is essential for lipid kinase activity.

Because the p85-regulatory subunit binds to any class IA subunit. it was assumed there is a single universal p85-mediated regulatory mechanism; however. we find isozyme-specific inhibition by p85α. Using deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS). we mapped regulatory interactions of p110δ with p85α. Both nSH2 and cSH2 domains of p85α contribute to full inhibition of p110δ. the nSH2 by contacting the helical domain and the cSH2 via the C terminus of p110δ. The cSH2 inhibits p110β and p110δ. but not p110α. implying that p110α is uniquely poised for oncogenic mutations. Binding RTK phosphopeptides disengages the SH2 domains. resulting in exposure of the catalytic subunit.

There are two classes of APDS: APDS1 that arises from p110δ mutations that are analogous to oncogenic mutations found in the broadly expressed p110α subunit and APDS2 that occurs from a splice mutation resulting in p85α with a central deletion (Δ434–475). As p85 regulatory subunits associate with and inhibit all class IA catalytic subunits.

The proper recruitment of proteins to membranes can be controlled by a wide variety of mechanisms. including protein lipidation. protein–protein interactions. posttranslational modifications. and binding to specific lipid species present in membranes. There are. however. only a limited number of analytical techniques that can study the assembly of protein–membrane complexes at the molecular level. A relatively new addition to the set of techniques available to study these protein–membrane systems is the use of hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS).

The cytosolic. or class 1. aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1) of higher vertebrates has an enhanced specificity for all-trans retinal. oxidising it to the powerful differentiation factor all-trans retinoic acid.

Experimental heat treatment of South African silcrete. using open fires of the kind used during the Middle Stone Age. shows that the process needed careful management. notwithstanding recent arguments to the contrary. Silcrete blocks fractured when heated on the surface of open fires or on coal beds. but were heated without mishap when buried in sand below a fire. Three silcrete samples. a control. a block heated underground with maximum temperature between 400 and 500 °C and a block heated in an open fire with maximum temperature between 700 and 800 °C. were analysed with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD).

Ca3N2and the isostructural Mg3N2crystallize in the anti-bixbyite structure of the mineral (Mn.

The decomposition ofM3N2(M=α-Ca. Mg) intoM(OH)2and NH3. when exposed to the atmosphere. is reported. The presence of NH+4vibrational bands in the decomposition products is explained in terms of the existence of Brønsted acid centers on the surface of the solid.

A growing concern about pollution and increasing landfill costs stimulates research into new ways to utilize coal fly ash for economically beneficial applications. Fly ash particles may be used as inorganic filler in polymers. an application which generally requires the modification of their surface properties. In order to design experiments that will result in controlled changes in surface chemistry and morphology. a detailed knowledge of the bulk chemical and mineralogical compositions of untreated fly ash particles. as well as their morphology and surface properties. is needed. In this paper. a combination of complementary bulk and surface techniques was explored to assess the physicochemical properties of a classified. ultrafine coal fly ash sample. and the findings were …,True,VvitzWYAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC,52,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169433214018273,794065441059038806,/scholar?cites=794065441059038806,,https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/42321/VanDerMerwe_Surface_2014.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Using a microscope attachment has the additional benefit of analysing very small spots (diameter 100 μm) directly on an artefact without sample preparation or destruction. It is therefore a suitable method to study residues on prehistoric stone tools. However. using a microscope without an ATR (attenuated total reflection) microscope objective. results in a combination of reflection and transmission/absorbance FTIR spectra. which is not always as easy to interpret as directly measured transmission/absorbance spectra. In order to improve the interpretation of spectra recorded on archaeological samples. the method was tested with replicated Middle Stone Age stone points used during hunting and butchery experiments on parts of a blue …,True,VvitzWYAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,48,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440313003580,6450575057607376097,/scholar?cites=6450575057607376097,,https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/39661/Prinsloo_Infrared_2014.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Enhanced photo‐oxidation is a possible route to accelerate the mineralisation of such litter. Thus we evaluated the effect of selected metal complexes and an anti‐oxidant on the accelerated weathering of blown polyethylene and polypropylene films in a QUV tester. It was found that the additives were more effective in polypropylene than in polyethylene. The transition metal complexes. particularly ferric stearate. were very effective photodegradants. Copper stearate provided a measure of UV protection to polyethylene but not to polypropylene. Poly (1.2‐dihydro‐2.2.4‐trimethylquinoline). a commercial anti‐oxidant. also caused accelerated UV degradation.

Here. the intrinsic effect of divalent alkaline earth metal ions (Be. Mg. Ca. Sr. Ba) on the structure of glycine in the absence of solvent is examined. Results from both density functional and Moller−Plesset theories indicate that for all metal ions except beryllium. the salt-bridge form of the ion. in which glycine is a zwitterion. is between 5 and 12 kcal/mol more stable than the charge-solvated structure in which glycine is in its neutral form. For beryllium. the charge-solvated structure is 5−8 kcal/mol more stable than the salt-bridge structure. Thus. there is a dramatic change in the structure of glycine with increased metal cation size.

Unfortunately. a region of interest in a protein. for example. because of proximity to an active site or the presence of important post-translational modifications. may not be covered by tryptic peptides. Detection limits. quantification accuracy. and isoform differentiation can also be improved with greater sequence coverage.

Studies in a variety of animal and cellular systems suggest that the IGF signaling pathway plays a key role in regulating skeletal muscle growth. differentiation. and in maintaining homeostasis of the adult muscle tissues. Intriguingly. IGFs stimulate both myoblast proliferation and differentiation. which are two mutually exclusive biological events during myogenesis. Both of these actions are mediated through the same IGF-1 receptor. Recent studies have shed new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these paradoxical actions of IGFs in muscle cells. In this article. we provide a brief review of our current understanding of the IGF signaling system and discuss recent findings on how local oxygen availability and IGFBPs act to specify IGF actions in muscle cells.,True,3Q0H1QMAAAAJ:a9-T7VOCCH8C,402,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016648010001565,633035647451480407,/scholar?cites=633035647451480407,,,0,0,0

Croatia,"Oscar Raab demonstrated. in 1900. that the light incidence on dyes can induce cell death [1]. A photosensitizer is a chemical compound that is activated by light of a specific wavelength that leads to tumor destruction [2]. Indeed. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is considered to have its origin in 1900 with the classical experiments by the german scientist Oscar Raab. Raab noticed that the exposure of Paramecium caudatum to acridine orange and later subjection to light resulted in death of this organism. Raab and his supervisor Hermann von Tappeiner later coined the term"" photodynamic therapy"" and applied PDT successfully for the treatment of cutaneous tumors using eosin. From that concept. photodynamic therapy (PDT)[3. 4. 5. 6]. as we known today. was founded. Since then. the development of other studies. culminating with those performed by Dougherty and coworkers resulted in a non-invasive technique for cancer treatment and other diseases [7. 8]. In fact. precancerous cells. certain types of cancer cells and microbial infections can be treated this way.Interesting data regarding the application of PDT against several diseases have been reported. since the employment of this therapy in different diseases has increased significantly.

Heidelberg,Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are energy- and intracellular carbon-storage compounds that can be mobilized and used when carbon is a limiting resource. Intracellular accumulation of PHA enhances the survival of several bacterial species under environmental stress conditions imposed in water and soil. such as UV irradiation. salinity. thermal and oxidative stress. desiccation. and osmotic shock. The ability to endure these stresses is linked to a cascade of events concomitant with PHA degradation and the expression of genes involved in protection against damaging agents. PHA synthesis involves enzymatic and transcriptional regulation. where the RpoS central stationary phase regulator sigma factor has been shown to be implicated. The energy generated during PHA degradation can also be used to drive various important energy-consuming pathways.

We found statistically significant associations with three SNPs (rs2298849 and rs2282679 in the GC gene. and rs10877012 in the CYP27B1 gene). although only for African Americans. A genotype score. representing the number of risk alleles across the three SNPs. alone accounted for 4.6% of the variation in serum vitamin D among African Americans.

The director is perpendicular to the rotation axis when Θ (the angle between the sample-spinning axis and the magnetic field direction) is smaller than the magic angle. and is parallel to the rotation axis when Θ is larger than the magic angle.

The spectral resolution for a static sample is limited due to the large number of anisotropic interactions. in particular strong proton–proton couplings. but resolution is greatly improved by magic-angle sample spinning. Here we present two-dimensional switched-angle spinning NMR experiments. which correlate the high-resolution spectrum of the membrane-bound peptide under magic-angle spinning with its anisotropic spectrum. leading to well-resolved spectra. The two-dimensional spectrum allows the exploitation of the high resolution of the isotropic spectrum. while retaining the structural information imparted by the anisotropic interactions in the static spectrum.

Also. it has been shown that oxidative stress plays a role in the progression of diabetes. Hyperglycemia. which occurs during diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) and. to a lesser extent. during insulin resistance. causes oxidative stress. Oxidative stress may be important in diabetes. not just because of its role in the development of complications. but because persistent hyperglycemia. secondary to insulin resistance. may induce oxidative stress and contribute to beta cell destruction in type 2 diabetes. Glucose control plays an important role in the prooxidant/antioxidant balance. A supplementation with antioxidants has been proposed as a complementary treatment. and some antidiabetic agents may by themselves have antioxidant properties independently of their role on glucose control.

However. we found that the level of bilirubin in the blood seemed to be an age-dependent phenomenon and closely related to the activation of leukocytes. In 1.000 cardiac catheterised patients from Urbana. USA suffering from CHD. the level of blood bilirubin was found to be lower than in age and sex-matched controls. The same results were obtained on 300 patients with acute ischemia from three hospitals from Bucharest. Romania. The activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes increased in the catheterised patients. as well in Romanian patients. An activation of leukocytes triggered by a chronic inflammatory process may increase the lysis of erythrocytes. The erythrocytes of patients with 100% stenosis exhibited a higher rate of in vitro lysis in the presence of activated leukocytes and homocysteine. The increased hemolysis may trigger the activation and removal of the resulting bilirubin from blood. Such a mechanism may depend on the liver clearing function. This function was decreased in catheterized patients over 60 years of age. but had accelerated in younger patients. An individual variation in liver function may explain the widespread bilirubin levels in the blood of patients suffering from CHD.,True,_a4Ru3sAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,57,https://europepmc.org/article/med/11712741,15115601801073466399,/scholar?cites=15115601801073466399,,,0,0,0

Furthermore. the vast structural spectrum of natural compounds can provide “lead compounds” for therapeutic improvement by molecular modification. Over 70% of anticancer compounds are either natural products. or natural product-derived substances. On the other hand conjugation of toxic natural products to monoclonal antibodies or polymeric carriers can lead to more efficacious targeted therapies. Since less than 15% of higher plants have been systematically investigated. the natural products research towards chemotherapy requires further attention and multi-scientific collaboration. An enforcing application to chemotherapy. using natural products. is also chemoprevention. Apart from vegetables and fruit. more than 1.000 different phytochemicals are already proved to possess interesting chemopreventing activities. Effectiveness of chemopreventing agents reflects their ability to counteract certain upstream signals that leads to genotoxic damage. redox imbalances and other forms of cellular stress.

Generally. glycine is synthesized from choline. serine. hydroxyproline. and threonine through interorgan metabolism in which kidneys and liver are the primarily involved. Generally in common feeding conditions. glycine is not sufficiently synthesized in humans. animals. and birds. Glycine acts as precursor for several key metabolites of low molecular weight such as creatine. glutathione. haem. purines. and porphyrins. Glycine is very effective in improving the health and supports the growth and well-being of humans and animals. There are overwhelming reports supporting the role of supplementary glycine in prevention of many diseases and disorders including cancer. Dietary supplementation of proper dose of glycine is effectual in treating metabolic disorders in patients with cardiovascular diseases. several inflammatory diseases. obesity. cancers. and diabetes.

Despite strict hygiene standards. biofilm-related infections associated with implantable devices remain a common complication in the clinic. Here. the application of highly dosed antibiotics is problematic in that the biofilm (i) provides a protective environment for microbes to evade antibiotics and/or (ii) can provide selective pressure for the evolution of antibiotic-resistant microbes. However. recent research suggests that effective prevention of biofilm formation may be achieved by multifunctional surface coatings that provide both non-adhesive and antimicrobial properties imparted by antimicrobial peptides.

Here we present the first study of Mediator in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans.

The C. albicans Mediator shares some roles with model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. such as functions in the response to certain stresses and the role of Med31 in the expression of genes regulated by the activator Ace2. The C. albicans Mediator also has additional roles in the transcription of genes associated with virulence. for example genes related to morphogenesis and gene families enriched in pathogens. such as the ALS adhesins. Consistently. Med31.

Infectious leptospires are resistant to killing by their hosts' alternative pathway of complement-mediated killing. and interact with various host extracellular matrix (ECM) components. The LenA outer surface protein (formerly called LfhA and Lsa24) was previously shown to bind the host ECM component laminin and the complement regulators factor H and factor H-related protein-1. We now demonstrate that infectious L. interrogans contain five additional paralogs of lenA. which we designated lenB. lenC. lenD. lenE and lenF. All six genes encode domains predicted to bear structural and functional similarities with mammalian endostatins. Sequence analyses of genes from seven infectious L. interrogans serovars indicated development of sequence diversity through recombination and intragenic duplication. LenB was found to bind human factor H. and all of the newly-described Len proteins bound laminin. In addition. LenB. LenC. LenD.

Mitochondrial cardiolipin with its unique bulky amphipathic structure is a potential substrate for phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in vivo. We have developed mass spectrometric methodology for analyzing PLA2 activity toward various cardiolipin forms and demonstrate that cardiolipin is a substrate for sPLA2. cPLA2 and iPLA2. but not for Lp-PLA2. Our results also show that none of these PLA2s have significant PLA1 activities toward dilyso-cardiolipin. To understand the mechanism of cardiolipin hydrolysis by PLA2. we also quantified the release of monolyso-cardiolipin and dilyso-cardiolipin in the PLA2 assays. The sPLA2s caused an accumulation of dilyso-cardiolipin. in contrast to iPLA2 which caused an accumulation of monolyso-cardiolipin. Moreover. cardiolipin inhibits iPLA2 and cPLA2. and activates sPLA2 at low mol fractions in mixed micelles of Triton X-100 with the substrate 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-phosphtidylcholine.

Despite its clear pharmaceutical relevance. no X-ray or NMR structural information is currently available for the iPLA2 or its membrane complex. In this paper. we combine homology modeling with coarse-grained (CG) and all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to build structural models of iPLA2 in association with a phospholipid bilayer. CG-MD simulations of the membrane insertion process were employed to provide a starting point for an atomistic description. Six AA-MD simulations were then conducted for 60 ns. starting from different initial CG structures. to refine the membrane complex. The resulting structures are shown to be consistent with each other and with deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS) experiments. suggesting that our approach is suitable for the modeling of iPLA2 at the membrane surface. The models show that an anchoring region (residues 710–724) forms an amphipathic helix that is stabilized by the membrane. In future studies. the proposed iPLA2 models should provide a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of lipid extraction and drug-inhibition.

Both genes are extremely divergent in respect to their introns. at the same time retaining 85% identity to their exons and functionally complementing inositol auxotroph Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Expression analysis showed both genes were expressed in all organs except seed. where only CaMIPS2 transcript was detected. Under environmental stresses. only CaMIPS2 was induced whereas CaMIPS1 expression remained same. which could be explained …,True,1UqyE3UAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,44,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01877.x,11576294413294880739,/scholar?cites=11576294413294880739,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01877.x,0,0,0

Virtually all of its biochemical actions are mediated through a single class of cell-surface receptors called AT1. These receptors contain the structural features of the seven-transmembrane. G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Angiotensin II. acting through the AT1 receptor. also stimulates the Jak/STAT pathway by inducing ligand-dependent Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. Here. we show that a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 54 amino acids of the rat AT1A receptor physically binds to Jak2 in an angiotensin II-dependent manner.

Since that time. numerous discoveries have advanced our understanding of the renin–angiotensin system. including the observation that angiotensin II is the effector molecule of this system. A remarkable aspect of angiotensin II is the many different physiological responses this simple peptide induces in different cell types. Here. we focus on the signal transduction pathways that are activated as a consequence of angiotensin II binding to the AT1 receptor. Classical signaling pathways such as the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by the AT1 receptor are discussed.

For HIV-2. the envelope (Env) protein replaces the role of Vpu. Both Vpu and HIV-2 Env enhance virus release by counteracting an innate host-cell block within human cells that is absent in African green monkey (AGM) cells. Here we identify calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) as a Vpu-interacting host factor that restricts HIV-1 release. Expression of human CAML (encoded by CAMLG) in AGM cells conferred a strong restriction of virus release that was reversed by Vpu and HIV-2 Env. suggesting that CAML is the mechanistic link between these two viral regulators. Depletion of CAML in human cells eliminated the need for Vpu in enhancing HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus release.

Jak2 autophosphorylates and binds the angiotensin II AT1 receptor. By studying a variety of Jak2 deletion proteins. we now show that the Jak2 protein motif231YRFRR is required for the co-association of this kinase with the AT1 receptor. We also used a full-length Jak2 protein containing a 231FAAAA amino acid substitution. Although this protein still autophosphorylated in response to angiotensin II. it did not co-associate with the AT1receptor.

Insulin activates mTORC1 through the PI3K-Akt pathway. which inhibits the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 complex (the TSC complex) to turn on Rheb. an essential activator of mTORC1. However. the mechanistic basis of how this pathway integrates with nutrient-sensing pathways is unknown. We demonstrate that insulin stimulates acute dissociation of the TSC complex from the lysosomal surface. where subpopulations of Rheb and mTORC1 reside. The TSC complex associates with the lysosome in a Rheb-dependent manner. and its dissociation in response to insulin requires Akt-mediated TSC2 phosphorylation. Loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor results in constitutive activation of mTORC1 through the Akt-dependent dissociation of the TSC complex from the lysosome.

Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous (Phaffia rhodozyma) is the only yeast known to produce astaxanthin. an anti-oxidant isoprenoid (carotenoid) that is widely used in the aquaculture. food. pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Recently. the potential of this microorganism as a platform cell factory for isoprenoid production has been recognized because of high flux through its native terpene pathway. Addition of mevalonate. the common precursor for isoprenoid biosynthesis. has been shown to be critical to enhance the astaxanthin content in X. dendrorhous. However. addition of mevalonate is unrealistic during industrial isoprenoid production because it is an unstable and costly chemical. Therefore. up-regulating the intracellular mevalonate supply by enhancing the mevalonate synthetic pathway though genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve isoprenoid production in X. dendrorhous. However. a system to strongly express multiple genes has been poorly developed for X. dendrorhous. Here. we developed a multiple gene expression system using plasmids containing three strong promoters in X. dendrorhous (actin. alcohol dehydrogenase and triose-phosphate isomerase) and their terminators. Using this system. three mevalonate synthetic pathway genes encoding acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase. HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase were overexpressed at the same time.

This suggests that mis-regulation of neuronal actin dynamics is central to SMA pathogenesis.

Various in vitro and cell-based models have been proposed for high throughput drug screening for potential therapeutic benefit in diseases of protein misfolding. Caenorhabditis elegans offers a convenient in vivo system for examination of Aß accumulation and toxicity in a complex multicellular organism. Ease of culturing and a short life cycle make this animal model well suited to rapid screening of candidate compounds. We have generated a new transgenic strain of C. elegans that expresses full length Aß1-42. This strain differs from existing Aß models that predominantly express amino-truncated Aß3-42. The Aß1-42 is expressed in body wall muscle cells. where it oligomerizes. aggregates and results in severe. and fully penetrant. age progressive-paralysis. The in vivo accumulation of Aß1-42 also stains positive for amyloid dyes. consistent with in vivo fibril formation. The utility of this model for identification of potential protective compounds was examined using the investigational Alzheimer’s therapeutic PBT2. shown to be neuroprotective in mouse models of AD and significantly improve cognition in AD patients. We observed that treatment with PBT2 provided rapid and significant protection against the Aß-induced toxicity in C. elegans. This C. elegans model of full length Aß1-42 expression can now be adopted for use in screens to rapidly identify and assist in development of potential therapeutics and to study underlying toxic mechanism(s) of Aß.,True,jWC4oPgAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,146,https://molecularneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1750-1326-7-57,873187056425075338,/scholar?cites=873187056425075338,,https://molecularneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1750-1326-7-57,0,0,0

Pathologically it is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neuronal loss within the brain tissue of affected individuals. It is now widely hypothesised that fibrillar structures represent an inert structure. Biophysical and toxicity assays attempting to characterize the formation of both the fibrillar and the intermediate oligomeric structures of Aβ typically involves preparing samples which are largely monomeric; the most common method by which this is achieved is to use the fluorinated organic solvent 1.1.1.3.3.3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP). Recent evidence has suggested that this method is not 100% effective in producing an aggregate free solution. We show. using dynamic light scattering. size exclusion chromatography and small angle X-ray scattering that this is indeed the case. with HFIP pretreated Aβ peptide solutions displaying an increased proportion of oligomeric and aggregated material and an increased propensity to aggregate. Furthermore we show that an alternative technique. involving treatment with strong alkali results in a much more homogenous solution that is largely monomeric.

However. formation of diffusible. oligomeric forms of Aβ. both on and off pathways to amyloid fibrils. is thought to include neurotoxic species responsible for synaptic loss and neurodegeneration. rather than polymeric amyloid aggregates. The 8-hydroxyquinolines (8-HQ) clioquinol (CQ) and PBT2 were developed for their ability to inhibit metal-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species from Aβ:Cu complexes and have both undergone preclinical and Phase II clinical development for the treatment of AD. Their respective modes of action are not fully understood and may include both inhibition of Aβ fibrillar polymerization and direct depolymerization of existing Aβ fibrils.

The concentration of TNBS is much greater throughout the reaction than that of amino groups. therefore. it is assumed that each class of amino group reacts according to pseudo first order kinetics. A check should be made that the reaction of TNBS with the amino groups that are being studied goes to completion in 5 minutes. Millimolar sulfite imparts a pink color to blank solutions used in the assay. by forming complexes with the TNBS. This color is a convenient indication that the sulfite concentration is adequate. however. the exact concentration of …,True,AnlYodwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,610,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S007668797225042X,7923748876583867580,/scholar?cites=7923748876583867580,,,0,0,0
1034190,The measurement of amino groups in proteins and peptides,1971,Robert Fields,124,Biochemical Journal,3,581-590,Portland Press Ltd.,A technique is examined for determining amino groups with 2.4.6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid. in which the extinction at 420nm of sulphite complexes of the trinitrophenylated amino groups is measured. The sensitivity of the method is 5–200nmol of amino group. The method is especially suitable for checking the extent of blocking or unblocking of amino groups in proteins and peptides. owing to the short time required for reaction (5min at room temperature). The reaction of the reagent with thiol groups has been studied and was found to proceed 30–50 times faster than with ∈-amino groups of model compounds. The ∈420 of a trinitrophenylated thiol group was found to be 2250m-1·cm-1. The reaction with several amino acids. peptides and proteins is presented.

HSF1 binds to and transcribes hsp genes and repeated satellite III (sat III) sequences present at the 9q12 locus. HSF1 binding to pericentric sat III sequences forms structures known as nuclear stress bodies (nSBs). nSBs represent a natural amplification of RNA pol II dependent transcription sites. Dynamics of HSF1 and of deletion mutants were studied in living cells using multi-confocal Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (mFCS) and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP).

The genetic alteration in these mice consists in a large 296 bp deletion at the 3′ part of the hairless gene (ID:MGI:3039558; J:89321). Here. we show that this deletion removes the stop codon and creates a new reading frame at the C terminus of the hairless protein. generating a larger mutant protein harboring an additional sequence of 117 amino acids. The mutant hairless gene mRNA is expressed during the embryonic and post-natal development of the hair follicle. The mutant protein is identified in bmh mouse skin at different stages of development by a specific antibody.

The degradosome components are recognized through natively unstructured ‘microdomains’ comprising as few as 15–40 amino acids. Consequently. the degradosome might experience a comparatively smaller number of evolutionary constraints. because there is little requirement to maintain a folded state for the interaction sites. New regulatory properties of the degradosome could arise with relative rapidity. because partners that modify its function could be recruited by quickly evolving microdomains.

Its interacting partners are involved in a wide range of cellular functions. In its dozens of hitherto identified binding partners DYNLL binds to a linear peptide segment. The known segments define a loosely characterized binding motif: [D/S]-4K-3X-2[T/V/I]-1Q0[T/V]1[D/E]2. The motifs are localized in disordered segments of the DYNLL-binding proteins and are often flanked by coiled coil or other potential dimerization domains. Based on a directed evolution approach. here we provide the first quantitative characterization of the binding preference of the DYNLL binding site. We displayed on M13 phage a naïve peptide library with seven fully randomized positions around a fixed. naturally conserved glutamine. The peptides were presented in a bivalent manner fused to a leucine zipper mimicking the natural dimer to dimer binding stoichiometry of DYNLL-partner complexes. The phage-selected consensus sequence V-5S-4R-3G-2T-1Q0T1E2 resembles the natural one. but is extended by an additional N-terminal valine. which increases the affinity of the monomeric peptide twentyfold. Leu-zipper dimerization increases the affinity into the subnanomolar range. By comparing crystal structures of an SRGTQTE-DYNLL and a dimeric VSRGTQTE-DYNLL complex we find that the affinity enhancing valine is accommodated in a binding pocket on DYNLL. Based on the in vitro evolved sequence pattern we predict a large number of novel DYNLL binding partners in the human proteome.

It appears therefore to be without prospects to find an alkyl mercury salt. which is excreted appreciably faster than other alkyl mercury salts.

These differences are however small.Since all the investigated alkyl mercury compounds are resorbed to about the same extent. the administered amounts being about the same. there are probably no appreciable differences between the rate of excretion between them.There is no reason to belive that the alkyl compounds have a certain …,True,D1okjhIAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC,106,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00312571,3173511515378465808,/scholar?cites=3173511515378465808,,,0,0,0
1034245,Distribution and excretion of mercury compounds in rats over a long period after a single injection,1968,Ake Swensson and Ulf Ulfvarson,26,Acta Pharmacol. Toxicol.;(Denmark),,,,Rats were given single subcutaneous injections of methyl mercuric hydroxide. mercury (II) nitrate and phenyl mercuric hydroxide. The elimination of the compounds and the concentration in the organs at different times were followed by means of isotope techniques. for almost 6 months. The rate of excretion changes during the observation period. A calculated biological half-life therefore will be different from time to time. If the elimination during the first 9 days is considered the half-life is 5 days for mercury (II) nitrate and phenyl mercuric hydroxide and 16 days for methyl mercuric hydroxide. After this the excretion rate becomes slower and slower. The distribution in the organs varies during the first part of the period. The blood concentration decreases rapidly for all compounds. while the concentrations in the kidneys increases and reaches a maximum after some days. The same holds true for the brain and testis when mercury (II) nitrate and methyl mercuric hydroxide are considered. The elimination from the kidneys. the brain and the testes is slower than from other organs for all compounds.

Cu.Zn-superoxide dismutase (Sod1) has been frequently associated with harmful effects. including neurotoxicity. This toxicity has been attributed to immature forms of Sod1 and extraneous catalytic activities. Among these. the ability of Sod1 to function as a peroxidase may be particularly relevant because it is increased in bicarbonate buffer and produces the reactive carbonate radical. Despite many studies. how this radical forms remains unknown.

In this study. we elucidated the free radical scavenger activity of purified murine PrPC in solution and its participation as a cell protector in astrocytes that were subjected to treatment with an oxidant. In vitro and using an EPR spin-trapping technique. we observed that PrPC decreased the oxidation of the DMPO trap in a Fenton reaction system (Cu2+/ascorbate/H2O2). which was demonstrated by approximately 70% less DMPO/OH. In cultured PrPC-knockout astrocytes from mice. the absence of PrPC caused an increase in intracellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation during the first 3 h of H2O2 treatment.

While stable in human plasma. these linkers are unstable in mouse plasma due to susceptibility to an extracellular carboxylesterase. This instability often triggers premature release of drugs in mouse circulation. presenting a molecular design challenge. Here. we report that an antibody–drug conjugate with glutamic acid–valine–citrulline linkers is responsive to enzymatic drug release but undergoes almost no premature cleavage in mice. We demonstrate that this construct exhibits greater treatment efficacy in mouse tumor models than does a valine–citrulline-based variant. Notably. our antibody–drug conjugate contains long spacers facilitating the protease access to the linker moiety. indicating that our linker assures high in vivo stability despite a high degree of exposure.

Whereas most standard antisense applications involve cleavage of the RNA by intracellular ribonuclease H (RNase H) or by argonaute2 (Ago2) enzymes. exon skipping by steric blocking merely requires binding of the ON in an antisense orientation to an RNA target and blockage of the important biological function of splicing.

However. their full effectiveness in cells and in vivo has often only been realized through development of suitable nonviral delivery systems. Among these. a range of natural and synthetic peptides have been found useful for enhancing cellular uptake and/or cell targeting of oligonucleotide analogues and siRNA. Such peptides are synthetically conjugated. used as noncovalent complexes. or used in combination with polymer. liposomal or exosome formulation techniques.

Decoy. in this sense. is ds ODNs bearing the consensus binding sequence for a DNA-binding protein.

NcLPMO9C from Neurospora crassa acts both on cellulose and on non-cellulose β-glucans. including cellodextrins and xyloglucan. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of NcLPMO9C revealed an extended. highly polar substrate-binding surface well suited to interact with a variety of sugar substrates. The ability of NcLPMO9C to act on soluble substrates was exploited to study enzyme-substrate interactions. EPR studies demonstrated that the Cu2+ center environment is altered upon substrate binding. whereas isothermal titration calorimetry studies revealed binding affinities in the low micromolar range for polymeric substrates that are due in part to the presence of a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM1).

The abundance and attractiveness of vegetal biomass come along with challenges pertaining to the intricacy of its structure. evolved during billions of years to face and resist abiotic and biotic attacks. To achieve the daunting goal of plant cell wall decomposition. microorganisms have developed many (enzymatic) strategies. from which we seek inspiration to develop biotechnological processes. A major breakthrough in the field has been the discovery of enzymes today known as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). which. by catalyzing the oxidative cleavage of recalcitrant polysaccharides. allow canonical hydrolytic enzymes to depolymerize the biomass more efficiently.

The observed Fe–O bond length (1.86–1.90 Å) is consistent with that of a single bond. The compound II state of myoglobin in crystals was controlled by single-crystal microspectrophotometry before and after synchrotron data collection. We observe some radiation-induced changes in both compound II (resulting in intermediate H) and in the resting ferric state of myoglobin. These radiation-induced states are quite unstable. and compound II and ferric myoglobin are immediately regenerated through a short heating above the glass transition temperature (<1 s) of the crystals.
