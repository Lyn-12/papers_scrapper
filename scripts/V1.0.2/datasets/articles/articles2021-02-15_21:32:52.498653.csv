1032776,Role of the antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide in heparin acceleration of antithrombin-proteinase reactions. Resolution of the antithrombin conformational change contribution …,1992,ST Olson and I Björk and Roberta Sheffer and PA Craig and JD Shore and J Choay,267,Journal of Biological Chemistry,18,12528-12538,Elsevier,The synthetic antithrombin-binding heparin pentasaccharide and a full-length heparin of approximately 26 saccharides containing this specific sequence have been compared with respect to their interactions with antithrombin and their ability to promote inhibition and substrate reactions of antithrombin with thrombin and factor Xa. The aim of these studies was to elucidate the pentasaccharide contribution to heparin's accelerating effect on antithrombin-proteinase reactions. Pentasaccharide and full-length heparins bound antithrombin with comparable high affinities (KD values of 36 +/- 11 and 10 +/- 3 nM. respectively. at I 0.15) and induced highly similar protein fluorescence. ultraviolet and circular dichroism changes in the inhibitor. Stopped-flow fluorescence kinetic studies of the heparin binding interactions at I 0.15 were consistent with a two-step binding process for both heparins. involving an initial weak …,True,xXlq664AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,587,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818423095,17734264617171140363,/scholar?cites=17734264617171140363,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818423095,0,0,0
1032777,Constitutions. constitutionalism. and the European Union,2001,Paul Craig,7,European Law Journal,2,125-150,Blackwell Publishers Ltd,The institutional reforms of the EU. coupled with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. have fuelled the debate about a European Constitution. This paper begins by examining the nature of constitutions and constitutionalism. The focus then turns to the EU itself. It is argued that the Community has indeed been transformed into a constitutional legal order. and that the arguments to the contrary are not convincing. This does not however mean that the EU has. or should have. a European Constitution cognisable as such which draws together the constitutional articles of the Treaties. together with the constitutional principles articulated by the European Court of Justice. The difficulties with this strategy are examined in detail. and the conclusion is that we should not at present pursue this course. It would be better to draw on the valuable work done by the European University Institute in its recent study in order to simplify …,True,xXlq664AAAAJ:E7VqQtBCVmcC,298,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0386.00124,8837410180213192173,/scholar?cites=8837410180213192173,,http://safaat.lecture.ub.ac.id/files/2012/03/Craig-2001-Constitution-Constitutionalism-and-EU.pdf,0,0,0
