1025034,Tau protein modifications and interactions: their role in function and dysfunction,2014,Anna Mietelska-Porowska and Urszula Wasik and Marcelina Goras and Anna Filipek and Grazyna Niewiadomska,15,,3,4671-4713,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Tau protein is abundant in the central nervous system and involved in microtubule assembly and stabilization. It is predominantly associated with axonal microtubules and present at lower level in dendrites where it is engaged in signaling functions. Post-translational modifications of tau and its interaction with several proteins play an important regulatory role in the physiology of tau. As a consequence of abnormal modifications and expression. tau is redistributed from neuronal processes to the soma and forms toxic oligomers or aggregated deposits. The accumulation of tau protein is increasingly recognized as the neuropathological hallmark of a number of dementia disorders known as tauopathies. Dysfunction of tau protein may contribute to collapse of cytoskeleton. thereby causing improper anterograde and retrograde movement of motor proteins and their cargos on microtubules. These disturbances in intraneuronal signaling may compromise synaptic transmission as well as trophic support mechanisms in neurons.

S.. and Reed. J. C. (2001) Mol. Cell 7. 915–926). In murine brain. CacyBP/SIP is expressed at a high level. but S100A6 is expressed at a very low level. Consequently we carried out experiments to determine if CacyBP/SIP binds to other S100 proteins in this tissue. Using CacyBP/SIP affinity chromatography. we found that S100B from the brain extract binds to CacyBP/SIP in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Using a nitrocellulose overlay assay with 125I-CacyBP/SIP and CacyBP/SIP affinity chromatography. we found that this protein binds purified S100A1. S100A6. S100A12.

1025036,S100A6–new facts and features,2009,Wiesława Leśniak and Łukasz P Słomnicki and Anna Filipek,390,,4,1087-1092,Academic Press,S100A6 (calcyclin) is a 10.5 kDa Ca2+-binding protein that belongs to the S100 protein family. S100A6 contains two EF-hand motifs responsible for binding of Ca2+. It also binds Zn2+ through not yet identified structures. Binding of Ca2+ induces a conformational change in the S100A6 molecule which in consequence increases its overall hydrophobicity and allows for interaction with target proteins. S100A6 was found in different mammalian and avian (chicken) tissues. A high level of S100A6 is observed in epithelial cells. fibroblasts and in different kinds of cancer cells. The function of S100A6 is not clear at present. but it has been suggested that it may be involved in cell proliferation. cytoskeletal dynamics and tumorigenesis. Additionally. S100A6 might have some extracellular activities.

1025100,Effects of dietary polyphenols on gene expression in human vascular endothelial cells,2008,Sonja K Nicholson and Gregory A Tucker and John M Brameld,67,,1,42-47,Cambridge University Press,Previous studies have shown that consumption of fruit and vegetables plays a role in preventing the onset of CVD. These beneficial effects have been linked to the presence of polyphenolic compounds in plant-derived foods and their antioxidant capacity. It has been hypothesised that polyphenols may also have a direct effect on vascular endothelial cell growth and the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and other roles of the endothelium. Previous studies in this area have tended to use concentrations of polyphenols that are supraphysiological (1–100 μm).

These values were related directly to growth rates (0.06 +/- 0.02 to 0.44 +/- 0.01 kg/day) and total hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels. Increased growth rates were accompanied by an increase in hepatic class 1 and class 2 IGF-I mRNA levels and an increase in the ratio of class 2 to class 1 IGF-I mRNA in liver. suggesting a distinct role for class 2 expression in the endocrine growth response. High levels of class 1 transcripts and a virtual absence of class 2 transcripts characterized all muscle tissues examined. and there was no correlation with plasma IGF-I levels.

VGF gene expression is photoperiodically regulated in the hypothalamus with significantly higher expression in lean Siberian hamsters. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of VGF in regulating these seasonal cycles by determining the effects of a VGF-derived peptide (TLQP-21) on food intake and body weight. Acute intracerebroventricular administration of TLQP-21 decreased food intake. and chronic treatment caused a sustained reduction in food intake and body weight and decreased abdominal fat depots.

Previous studies have revealed a profound up-regulation of type 3 deiodinase (DIO3) mRNA in the ventral ependyma of the hypothalamus associated with hypophagia and weight loss in short-day photoperiods. DIO3 reduces the local availability of T3. so the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that decreased hypothalamic T3 availability underlies the short-day-induced catabolic state. The experimental approach was to determine whether a local increase in T3 in the hypothalamus of hamsters exposed to short days could reverse the behavioral and physiological changes induced by this photoperiod.

Recently research has been focused on peptides from marine animal sources. since they have been found as secondary metabolites from sponges. ascidians. tunicates. and mollusks. The structural characteristics of these peptides include various unusual amino acid residues which may be responsible for their bioactivity. Moreover. protein hydrolysates formed by the enzymatic digestion of aquatic and marine by-products are an important source of bioactive peptides. Purified peptides from these sources have been shown to have antioxidant activity and cytotoxic effect on several human cancer cell lines such as HeLa. AGS. and DLD-1. These characteristics imply that the use of peptides from marine sources has potential for the prevention and treatment of cancer. and that they might also be useful as molecular models in anticancer drug research. This review focuses on the latest studies and critical research in this field. and evidences the immense potential of marine animals as bioactive peptide sources.

The term surfactant covers surface-active compounds which are characterized by their ability to concentrate at surfaces and to form micelles in solution. The prerequisite for this surface activity is the amphiphilic structure of the surfactant molecule. which consists of a polar (hydrophilic) part and a nonpolar (hydrophobic) part. In APEOs. the hydrophilic group is a polyethoxylate chain with varying ethoxylation degrees (number of ethoxylate (EO) units) 1-40).

Remediation of these synthetic compounds is difficult and an enormous logistical task. Phytoremediation is a technique that offers an environmentally friendly. low-cost alternative to current remediation techniques; however. this approach is hindered by the low inherent metabolic abilities of plants towards these xenobiotic compounds and the phytotoxicity of these compounds.

One underlying reason is the fact that detergents do not stabilize membrane domains as efficiently as natural lipids in membranes. often leading to a partial to complete loss of activity/stability during protein extraction and purification and preventing crystallization in an active conformation.   Methodology/Principal Findings Anionic calix[4]arene based detergents (C4Cn. n = 1–12) were designed to structure the membrane domains through hydrophobic interactions and a network of salt bridges with the basic residues found at the cytosol-membrane interface of membrane proteins. These compounds behave as surfactants. forming micelles of 5–24 nm. with the critical micellar concentration (CMC) being as expected sensitive to pH ranging from 0.05 to 1.5 mM. Both by 1H NMR titration and Surface Tension titration experiments. the interaction of these molecules with the basic amino acids was confirmed. They extract membrane proteins from different origins behaving as mild detergents. leading to partial extraction in some cases. They also retain protein functionality. as shown for BmrA (Bacillus multidrug resistance ATP protein). a membrane multidrug-transporting ATPase. which is particularly sensitive to detergent extraction. These new detergents allow BmrA to bind daunorubicin with a Kd of 12 µM. a value similar to that observed after purification using dodecyl maltoside (DDM).

A general procedure using ceramic hydroxyapatite (HAP) chromatography was developed for the complete removal of SDS bound to soluble or membrane proteins.

To investigate the structure of the tetramer. a nitroxide side chain (R1) was introduced at 18 different positions. The effects of R1 on oligomer formation. EPR spectra. and inter‐spin distance measurements all show that the structures of the solution and crystal tetramers are different. Inter‐subunit distance measurements revealed that only arrestin monomer binds to light‐activated phosphorhodopsin. whereas both monomer and tetramer bind microtubules. which may serve as a default arrestin partner in dark‐adapted photoreceptors. Thus. the tetramer likely serves as a ‘storage’ form of arrestin. increasing the arrestin‐binding capacity of microtubules while readily dissociating to supply active monomer when it is …,True,8MV-deIAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,108,https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/sj.emboj.7601614,17506761684105629849,/scholar?cites=17506761684105629849,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.1038/sj.emboj.7601614,0,0,0

H96. and H119) and a hydroxide ion with tetrahedral geometry. Structural and functional analysis of variants in which the zinc ligands H94 and H119 are substituted with asparagine and glutamine. and comparison with results obtained with aspartate and glutamate substitutions indicate that the neutral ligand field provided by the protein optimizes the electrostatic environment for the catalytic function of the metal ion. including stabilization of bound anions. This is demonstrated by catalytic activity measurements for ester hydrolysis and CO2 hydration. as well as sulfonamide inhibitor affinity assays.

Spx,2005,Shunji Nakano and Kyle N Erwin and Martina Ralle and Peter Zuber,55,Molecular microbiology,2,498-510,Blackwell Science Ltd,The Spx protein is indispensable for survival of Bacillus subtilis under disulphide stress. Its interaction with the α‐subunit of RNA polymerase is required for transcriptional induction of genes that function in thiol homeostasis. such as thioredoxin (trxA) and thioredoxin reductase (trxB). The N‐terminal end of Spx contains a Cys–X–X–Cys (CXXC) motif. which is a likely target for redox‐sensitive control. We show here that Spx directly activates trxA and ‐B transcription by interacting with the RNA polymerase α‐subunit. but it does so only under an oxidized condition. The transcriptional activation by Spx requires formation of an intramolecular disulphide bond between two cysteine residues that reside in the CXXC motif.

Mutations in WNDP lead to a severe metabolic disorder. Wilson's disease. The function of WNDP depends on Atox1. a cytosolic metallochaperone that delivers copper to WNDP. We demonstrate that the metal-binding site 2 (MBS2) in the N-terminal domain of WNDP (N-WNDP) plays an important role in this process. The transfer of one copper from Atox1 to N-WNDP results in selective protection of the metal-coordinating cysteines in MBS2 against labeling with a cysteine-directed probe. Such selectivity is not observed when free copper is added to N-WNDP. Similarly. site-directed mutagenesis of MBS2 eliminates stimulation of the catalytic activity of WNDP by the copper-Atox1 complex but not by free copper.

Here we report that a nicked HJ is the preferred substrate of endogenous and recombinant Mus81-Eme1. Cleavage occurs specifically on the strand that opposes the nick. resulting in resolution of the structure into linear duplex products. Resolving cuts made by the endogenous Mus81-Eme1 complex on an intact HJ are quasi-simultaneous. indicating that Mus81-Eme1 resolves HJs by a nick and counternick mechanism. with a large rate enhancement of the second cut arising from the flexible nature of the nicked HJ intermediate.

Multiple linear chromosomes. an abundance of regulatory elements. and chromosome packaging are all challenges that the eukaryotic DNA replication machinery must successfully overcome. The replication machinery. the “replisome” complex. is composed of many specialized proteins with functions in supporting replication by DNA polymerases. Efficient replisome progression relies on tight coordination between the various factors of the replisome. Further. replisome progression must occur on less than ideal templates at various genomic loci. Here. we describe the functions of the major replisome components. as well as some of the obstacles to efficient DNA replication that the replisome confronts.

The mechanism of this specific toxicity is not fully understood. Recently. it has been discovered that O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is enriched in the β-cells. It has been proposed that STZ toxicity may be due to its inhibition of neutral O-GlcNAcase activity. the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc from cytosolic proteins (K. Liu et al.. 2000. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Unfortunately. DNA can degrade in the environment. sometimes below the level at which it can be amplified by PCR. Protein however is chemically more robust than DNA and can persist for longer periods. Protein also contains genetic variation in the form of single amino acid polymorphisms. These can be used to infer the status of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism alleles. To demonstrate this. we used mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics to characterize hair shaft proteins in 66 European-American subjects. A total of 596 single nucleotide polymorphism alleles were correctly imputed in 32 loci from 22 genes of subjects’ DNA and directly validated using Sanger sequencing. Estimates of the probability of resulting individual non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism allelic profiles in the European population. using the product rule. resulted in a maximum power of discrimination of 1 in 12.500. Imputed non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism profiles from European–American subjects were considerably less frequent in the African population (maximum likelihood ratio = 11.000). The converse was true for hair shafts collected from an additional 10 subjects with African ancestry. where some profiles were more frequent in the African population.

The present study addressed the role of cannabinoid receptors during remote cell death of central neurons in a model that is based on cerebellar lesions. A lesion in one cerebellar hemisphere induced remote cell death and type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R) expression in contralateral precerebellar neurons. Of the selective agonists and antagonists that modulated cannabinoid receptor activity. we found that the CB2R agonist JWH-015 reduced neuronal loss and cytochrome-c release. leading to neurological recovery; these effects were reversed by the selective CB2R antagonist SR144528. Analysis of CB2R-triggered signal transduction demonstrated that in axotomized neurons.

The biological activity of anandamide. a prominent member of this group. depends on the metabolic control exerted by biosynthetic. catabolic and oxidative pathways working together. Cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of anandamide are crucial steps in the process. Whereas the identity of anandamide transmembrane carriers remains undetermined. recent insights have been gained related to its intracellular stores (adiposomes) and intracellular binding proteins. particularly fatty acid binding proteins. albumin and heat shock protein 70. On this basis. we propose a reconsideration of the dogma that endocannabinoids are exclusively synthesized and released ‘on demand’. and suggest that their metabolic control is complemented by intracellular trafficking and storage in specific reservoirs.,True,FUlF5iAAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,167,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000964,609384234951822201,/scholar?cites=609384234951822201,,https://www.academia.edu/download/64725273/j.tibs.2010.05.00820201020-23547-1srf323.pdf,0,0,0

One of the major hurdles to a deeper understanding of these pathological processes is the absence of clearly defined inductive mechanisms. which. if identified and characterised. could guide clinical strategies for their prevention or allow therapeutic intervention. Molecular mimicry leading to crossreactive autoimmune responses has gained strong experimental support in the past decade. A fundamental premise of this hypothesis is the involvement of a mimicking environmental trigger. In view of the numerous viral and bacterial agents epidemiologically linked to autoimmune liver diseases. we and others have proposed molecular mimicry to be an important mechanism in these diseases.

Biofilm-dwelling bacteria are particularly resistant to antibiotics. making it hard to eradicate biofilm-associated infections. Bacteria rely on efflux pumps to get rid of toxic substances. We discovered that efflux pumps are highly active in bacterial biofilms. thus making efflux pumps attractive targets for antibiofilm measures. A number of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) are known. EPIs were shown to reduce biofilm formation. and in combination they could abolish biofilm formation completely. Also. EPIs were able to block the antibiotic tolerance of biofilms.

Conventional antibiotics generally kill bacteria by interfering with vital cellular functions. an approach that imposes selection pressure for resistant bacteria. New approaches are urgently needed. Targeting bacterial virulence functions directly is an attractive alternative. An obvious target is bacterial adhesion. Bacterial adhesion to surfaces is the first step in colonization. invasion. and biofilm formation. As such. adhesion represents the Achilles heel of crucial pathogenic functions. It follows that interference with adhesion can reduce bacterial virulence. Here. we illustrate this important topic with examples of techniques being developed that can inhibit bacterial adhesion.

It has an optimum growth temperature of 83°C and is described as a strict anaerobe. Its genome lacks any homologue of canonical superoxide (O2·−) dismutases.

TheKmfor sulfite in the MV+•:sulfite oxidoreductase assay is 0.75 mM. and the specific activity 2.06 μmolH2/min/mg. Visible and EPR spectroscopies studies indicate that the enzyme high-spin heme reacts with sulfite in the oxidised state. and that sulfide partially reduces the enzyme.

Dnm1. which is a yeast DRP (Drp1/Dlp1 in humans). is required for mitochondrial division. but its mechanism is unknown. We provide evidence that Dnm1 likely functions through self-assembly to drive the membrane constriction event that is associated with mitochondrial division. Two regulatory features of Dnm1 self-assembly were also identified. Dnm1 self-assembly proceeded through a rate-limiting nucleation step. and nucleotide hydrolysis by assembled Dnm1 structures was highly cooperative with respect to GTP. Dnm1 formed extended spirals. which possessed diameters greater than those of dynamin-1 spirals but whose sizes. remarkably. were equal to those of mitochondrial constriction sites in vivo.

The yeast dynamin-related protein Dnm1 has been localized to sites of mitochondrial division. Using cryo-EM. we have determined the three-dimensional (3D) structure of Dnm1 in a GTP-bound state.

Dnm1 constricted liposomes and subsequently dissociated from the lipid bilayer. The magnitude of Dnm1 constriction was substantially larger than the decrease in diameter previously reported for dynamin.

We find that the core lipid-binding domain found in all ORPs can simultaneously bind two membranes. Using Osh4p/Kes1p as a representative ORP. we show that ORPs have at least two membrane-binding surfaces; one near the mouth of the sterol-binding pocket and a distal site that can bind a second membrane.

Some of these abnormal metabolites are reconverted to normal metabolites by repair enzymes. which play therefore a role akin to the proofreading activities of DNA polymerases and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. An illustrative example of such repair enzymes is L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. which eliminates a metabolite abnormally made by a Krebs cycle enzyme. Mutations in L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase lead to L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. a leukoencephalopathy. Other examples are the epimerase and the ATP-dependent dehydratase that repair hydrated forms of NADH and NADPH; ethylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase. which eliminates an abnormal metabolite formed …,True,tvTdOhEAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,66,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10545-012-9571-1,12490993606893415832,/scholar?cites=12490993606893415832,,,0,0,0

The consideration of gene expression correlation over a time or tissue dimension has proved valuable in predicting gene function. Here. we consider correlations over a genetic dimension. In addition to identifying coregulated genes. the genetic dimension also supplies us with information about the genomic locations of putative regulatory loci. We calculated correlations among approximately 45.000 expression traits derived from 60 individuals in an F2 sample segregating for obesity and diabetes. By combining the correlation results with linkage mapping information. we were able to identify regulatory networks. make functional predictions for uncharacterized genes. and characterize novel members of known pathways. We found evidence of coordinate regulation of 174 G protein–coupled receptor protein signaling pathway expression traits.

The multifactorial causes of obesity include several genetic. dietary and lifestyle variables that together result in an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Dietary approaches to limit fat intake are commonly prescribed to achieve the hypocaloric conditions necessary for weight loss. But dietary fat restriction is often accompanied by increased carbohydrate intake. which can dramatically increase endogenous fatty acid synthesis depending upon carbohydrate composition. Since both dietary and endogenously synthesized fatty acids contribute to the whole-body fatty acid pool. obesity can therefore result from excessive fat or carbohydrate consumption.

Dichloroacetate (DCA) has recently been proposed as a novel and relatively non-toxic anti-cancer agent that can reverse the glycolytic phenotype in cancer cells through the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. We have examined the effect of DCA against breast cancer cells. including in a highly metastatic in vivo model. The growth of several breast cancer cell lines was found to be inhibited by DCA in vitro.

In the 10 years since the first knockout of the mouse p53 tumor suppressor gene (designated Trp53) was published. much has been learned about the contribution of p53 to biology and tumor suppression in the breast through the use of p53 transgenic and knockout mice. The original mice deficient in p53 showed no mammary gland phenotype. However. studies using BALB/c-Trp53-deficient mice have demonstrated a delayed involution phenotype and a mammary tumor phenotype. Together with other studies of mutant p53 transgenes and p53 bitransgenics. a greater understanding has been gained of the role of p53 in involution. of the regulation of p53 activity by hormones. of the effect of mouse strain and modifier genes on tumor phenotype. and of the cooperation between p53 and other oncogenic pathways. chemical carcinogens and hormonal stimulation in mammary tumorigenesis.
