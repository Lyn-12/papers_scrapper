The unique properties of these materials increase the likelihood that they will interfere with analytical techniques. which may contribute to this phenomenon. We tested the potential for: 1) nanoparticle intrinsic fluorescence/absorbance. 2) interactions between nanoparticles and assay components. and 3) the effects of adding both nanoparticles and analytes to an assay. to interfere with the accurate assessment of toxicity. Silicon. cadmium selenide. titanium dioxide. and helical rosette nanotubes each affected at least one of the six assays tested. resulting in either substantial over- or under-estimations of toxicity. Simulation of realistic assay conditions revealed that interference could not be predicted solely by interactions between nanoparticles and assay components. Moreover. the nature and degree of interference cannot be predicted solely based on our current understanding of nanomaterial behaviour. A literature survey indicated that ca. 95% of papers from 2010 using biochemical techniques to assess nanotoxicity did not account for potential interference of nanoparticles. and this number had not substantially improved in 2012.

PBP consists of two pyrene groups bridged by a bipyridyl spacer. and exhibits similar solubility and chromatographic properties to some fractions of asphaltenes. On the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance. steady state fluorescence. vapor pressure osmometry. solubility. and adsorption behavior studies. PBP gave self-association in solution. On the basis of these data and single crystal X-ray analysis. this behavior was attributed to π–π stacking interactions involving both pyrene rings and the bipyridine spacer. These results demonstrate that bridged aromatic species with up to four fused aromatic rings are capable of self-association in solution.,True,6xr9l5EAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,76,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ef700395g,6474171235712497678,/scholar?cites=6474171235712497678,,,0,0,0

We have developed solid state NMR sample cells for investigation of deformations of bone tissue components at loads up to several Mega Pascal. The size constraints of the NMR instrumentation limit the bone specimen diameter and length to be no greater than 2-3 mm and 30 mm respectively. Further. magic angle spinning (MAS) solid state NMR experiments require the use of non-metallic apparatus that can be rotated at kilohertz rates. These experimental constraints preclude the use of standard biomechanical measurement systems. In this paper we explore the use of quantum dot center of gravity measurement as a strain gage technology consistent with the constraints of solid state NMR.

1085992,Investigating the Effects of Age and Exercise on Bone Composition and the Impact of Composition on Mechanical Integrity.,2009,Nadder David Sahar,,,,,,Fractures are the most frequent health problem associated with bone and represent a significant clinical and economic burden.  Clinically. fracture risk is diagnosed by low bone mass and interventions to reduce fracture risk are designed to increase mass.  However. aging and interventions. like exercise. influence fracture risk by more than what changes in mass predict. indicating that exercise and aging alter skeletal integrity by altering tissue quality. not just quantity.  Currently. there is no clear understanding of how tissue quality contributes to skeletal integrity or how it can be altered by external influences.  Therefore. this study examined the hypothesis that exercise and aging in adult mice would alter bone composition leading to altered mechanical competence. even when adjusting for changes to bone size and shape.  Exercise significantly improved strength and resistance to fatigue-induced damage in young mice. but had no measured benefit in old mice.  In young mice. exercise also increased mineralization and decreased carbonate substitution.  Aging significantly reduced structural and tissue-level mechanical properties and increased mineral crystal size. carbonate substitution. and microcracking.  Compositional changes with exercise and aging occurred in pre-existing bone (determined by micro-CT and calcein labeling) and mechanical improvements were observed without significant increases in bone size. demonstrating that bone can adapt to external stimuli by altering tissue quality without requiring modeling or remodeling.

Here. we describe the use of Raman spectroscopy to extract quantitative orientation information from bone tissue. Bone tissue poses special challenges to the use of polarized Raman spectroscopy for measurement of orientation distribution functions because the tissue is turbid and birefringent. Multiple scattering in turbid media depolarizes light and is potentially a source of error. Using a Raman microprobe. we show that repeating the measurements with a series of objectives of differing numerical apertures can be used to assess the contributions of sample turbidity and depth of field to the calculated orientation distribution functions. With this test. an optic can be chosen to minimize the systematic errors introduced by multiple scattering events.

Our finding that matrix distortion involves changes in the position of (proline) is not unexpected. Proline and hydroxyproline are the most abundant amino acids in X. Y positions of the repeat gly-XY unit of collagen. The local conformation is determined by enthalpic forces stabilizing hydroxyproline and hydrogen bonding stabilizing proline position.

The ability to engineer proteins with novel regulation has applications in biosensors. selective protein therapeutics. and basic research. One approach to building proteins with novel switch properties is creating combinatorial libraries of gene fusions between genes encoding proteins that have the prerequisite input and output functions of the desired switch. These libraries are then subjected to selections and/or screens to identify those rare gene fusions that encode functional switches. Combinatorial libraries in which an insert gene is inserted randomly into an acceptor gene have been useful for creating switches. particularly when combined with circular permutation of the insert gene.

These double‐stranded breaks occur not only in the origin of replication near inverted repeats but also at a wide variety of locations throughout the plasmid. S1 nuclease exhibits this activity under conditions typically employed for the nuclease's single‐stranded nuclease activity. Thus. S1 nuclease digestion of plasmid DNA. unlike analogous digestion with DNaseI. effectively halts after the first double‐stranded break. This property makes easier the construction of large domain insertion libraries in which the goal is to insert linear DNA at a variety of locations throughout a plasmid. We used this property to create a library in which a circularly permuted TEM1 β‐lactamase gene was inserted throughout a plasmid containing the gene encoding …,True,A1ivkZwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,24,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.23224,7875550934261600205,/scholar?cites=7875550934261600205,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181043/,0,0,0

Switches can be built by the proper fusion of two proteins with the prerequisite input and output functions. However. the exact fusion geometry for switch creation. which typically involves insertion of one protein domain into the other. is difficult to predict. Based on our previous work developing protein switches using periplasmic binding proteins as input domains. we wondered whether there are “hot spots” for insertion of output domains and successful switch creation within this class of proteins. Here we describe directed evolution experiments that identified switches in which TEM‐1 beta‐lactamase (BLA) is inserted into the class I periplasmic binding proteins ribose binding protein (RBP). glucose binding protein (GBP). and xylose binding protein (XBP).

Different mechanisms can cause this inhibition and. in most cases. the use of classical enzymology approach is not sufficient to overcome this problem.

An approach towards achieving this goal is to leverage naturally occurring proteins that function through recognition of amino (N)-terminal amino acids (NAAs). One such protein. the N-end rule pathway adaptor protein ClpS. natively recognizes NAAs on a peptide chain. The native ClpS protein has a high specificity albeit modest affinity for the amino acid Phe at the N-terminus but also recognizes the residues Trp. Tyr. and Leu at the N-terminal position. Here. we employed directed evolution methods to select for ClpS variants with enhanced affinity and selectivity for two NAAs (Phe and Trp).

Because the genetic control of bone structure and function is both local- and gender-specific and because there is evidence of gender-specific effects associated with genetic deficiencies. it was hypothesized that the engineered deletion of the gene encoding bgn would result in a cortical bone mechanical phenotype that was bone- and gender-specific.

Despite collagen’s importance. little is known about its nanoscale morphology in tissues and how morphology relates to mechanical function. This study probes nanoscale structure and mechanical properties of collagen as a function of disease in native hydrated tendons. Wild type tendon and tendon from the Brtl/+ mouse model of Osteogenesis Imperfecta were investigated. An atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to image and indent minimally-processed collagen fibrils in hydrated and dehydrated conditions.

Animal models have confirmed that these changes compromise whole bone mechanical properties. Estimates from whole bone testing suggest that material properties are negatively affected. though tissue-level assessmentshavenot been conducted. Therefore. the goal of the present study was to examine changes in cortical bone at different length scales using a rat model with theprogressive development of CKD. At 30 weeks of age (∼75% reduction in kidney function). skeletally mature male Cy/+ rats were compared to their normal littermates. Cortical bone material propertieswere assessed with reference point indentation (RPI). atomic force microscopy (AFM). Raman spectroscopy.and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Bones from animals with CKD had higher (+18%) indentation distance increase and first cycle energy dissipation (+8%) as measured by RPI.AFM indentation revealed a broader distribution of elastic modulus values in CKD animals witha greater proportion of both higher and lower modulus values compared to normal controls. Yet. tissue composition. collagen morphology. and collagen cross-linking fail to account for these differences.

Inbred strain‐specific responses to external stimuli also exist. but the role of background strain in response to genetic deletion is not fully understood. Biglycan (bgn) deficiency impacts bone through negative regulation of osteoblasts. resulting in extracellular matrix alterations and decreased mechanical properties. Because osteoblasts from C3H/He (C3H) mice are inherently more active versus osteoblasts from other inbred strains. and the bones of C3H mice are less responsive to other insults. it was hypothesized that C3H mice would be relatively more resistant to changes associated with bgn deficiency compared with C57BL6/129 (B6;129) mice.

Other research in the literature indicates that increased mineral content. cross-sectional geometry and structural strength due to exercise can be maintained or increased after exercise ends for as long as 14 weeks.

However. most outcomes of these studies are restricted to changes in bone architecture and do not explore the mechanical implications of those changes. Herein. we studied both the mechanical and morphological adaptions of bone to three strain levels using a targeted tibial loading mouse model. We hypothesized that loading would increase bone architecture and improve cortical mechanical properties in a dose-dependent fashion. The right tibiae of female C57BL/6 mice (8 week old) were compressively loaded for 2 weeks to a maximum compressive force of 8.8N. 10.6N. or 12.4N (generating periosteal strains on the anteromedial region of the mid-diaphysis of 1700 με. 2050 με. or 2400 με as determined by a strain calibration). while the left limb served as an non-loaded control. Following loading. ex vivo analyses of bone architecture and cortical mechanical integrity were assessed by micro-computed tomography and 4-point bending. Results indicated that loading improved bone architecture in a dose-dependent manner and improved mechanical outcomes at 2050 με. Loading to 2050 με resulted in a strong and compelling formation response in both cortical and cancellous regions. In addition. both structural and tissue level strength and energy dissipation were positively impacted in the diaphysis. Loading to the highest strain level also resulted in rapid and robust formation of bone in both cortical and cancellous regions.

Catalyst testing has been carried out at two positions in the reactor; one where it is mixed with the feed and other. by placing it in a catalyst boat to allow vapour phase contact. The thermal experiments have been carried out at 300. 350. 400 and 450 °C and the catalytic experiments have been carried out at 350 °C. Bio-oil yields are lower in all cases of catalytic pyrolysis of wheat straw compared to thermal run. With wheat husk. most cases of catalytic pyrolysis produced more bio-oil than thermal run. The bio-oil has been characterised using Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) and 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) and bio-char using Fourier Transform-Infra Red spectroscopy (FT-IR).

Slow pyrolysis of cotton residue has been carried out under nitrogen atmosphere at temperatures of 300. 350. 400 and 450 °C. Maximum bio-oil yield of 38 wt% was obtained at 400 °C. The organic fraction of bio-oil has been characterised using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Bio-oil contains phenolic compounds which are mostly derived from lignin fraction. The bio-char characterisation using FT-IR. powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicate the aromatic structure of bio-char. The gas characterisation indicates that decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions have majorly occurred during pyrolysis.,True,bgH_pvAAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12649-015-9440-x,2224943212912619190,/scholar?cites=2224943212912619190,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bijoy_Biswas4/publication/282567497_Role_of_Reaction_Temperature_on_Pyrolysis_of_Cotton_Residue/links/5d43e195a6fdcc370a74476b/Role-of-Reaction-Temperature-on-Pyrolysis-of-Cotton-Residue.pdf,0,0,0
