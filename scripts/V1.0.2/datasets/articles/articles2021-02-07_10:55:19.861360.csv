70580,Signaling through scaffold. anchoring. and adaptor proteins,1997,Tony Pawson and John D Scott,278,,5346,2075-2080,American Association for the Advancement of Science,The process by which extracellular signals are relayed from the plasma membrane to specific intracellular sites is an essential facet of cellular regulation. Many signaling pathways do so by altering the phosphorylation state of tyrosine. serine. or threonine residues of target proteins. Recently. it has become apparent that regulatory mechanisms exist to influence where and when protein kinases and phosphatases are activated in the cell. The role of scaffold. anchoring. and adaptor proteins that contribute to the specificity of signal transduction events by recruiting active enzymes into signaling networks or by placing enzymes close to their substrates is discussed.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2618,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/278/5346/2075.abstract,18101002912438513293,/scholar?cites=18101002912438513293,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edita_Aksamitiene/post/Differences_between_adaptors_and_scaffolds_in_signaling/attachment/5cff1811cfe4a7968da9500b/AS%3A768439715110913%401560221713879/download/Signaling+through+Scaffold%2C+Anchoring+and+Adaptor+Proteins.pdf,0,0,0
70581,AKAP signalling complexes: focal points in space and time,2004,Wei Wong and John D Scott,5,,12,959-970,Nature Publishing Group,Multiprotein signalling networks create focal points of enzyme activity that disseminate the intracellular action of many hormones and neurotransmitters. Accordingly. the spatio-temporal activation of protein kinases and phosphatases is an important factor in controlling where and when phosphorylation events occur. Anchoring proteins provide a molecular framework that orients these enzymes towards selected substrates. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) are signal-organizing molecules that compartmentalize various enzymes that are regulated by second messengers.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1113,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm1527,12693891010417999858,/scholar?cites=12693891010417999858,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.240&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Here we show that homologues of proteins necessary for asymmetric cell division in Caenorhabditis elegans associate with each other in mammalian cells and tissues. mPAR-3 and mPAR-6 exhibit similar expression patterns and subcellular distributions in the CNS and associate through their PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains. mPAR-6 binds to Cdc42/Rac1 GTPases. and mPAR-3 and mPAR-6 bind independently to atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoforms. In vitro. mPAR-3 acts as a substrate and an inhibitor of aPKC.

70583,Phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD by mitochondria-anchored protein kinase A,1999,Hisashi Harada and Brian Becknell and Matthias Wilm and Matthias Mann and Lily Jun-shen Huang and Susan S Taylor and John D Scott and Stanley J Korsmeyer,3,Molecular cell,4,413-422,Cell Press,Signaling pathways between cell surface receptors and the BCL-2 family of proteins regulate cell death. Survival factors induce the phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD. a proapoptotic member. Purification of BAD kinase(s) identified membrane-based cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) as a BAD Ser-112 (S112) site-specific kinase. PKA-specific inhibitors blocked the IL-3-induced phosphorylation on S112 of endogenous BAD as well as mitochondria-based BAD S112 kinase activity. A blocking peptide that disrupts type II PKA holoenzyme association with A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) also inhibited BAD phosphorylation and eliminated the BAD S112 kinase activity at mitochondria. Thus. the anchoring of PKA to mitochondria represents a focused subcellular kinase/substrate interaction that inactivates BAD at its target organelle in response to a survival factor.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,750,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276500804694,9773423948998212370,/scholar?cites=9773423948998212370,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276500804694,0,0,0

For example. ‘A-kinase anchoring proteins’ (AKAPs) bind to the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to direct the kinase to discrete intracellular locations. Recently. functional studies aimed at disrupting AKAP–PKA complexes have demonstrated a role for anchored PKA in various cellular processes. including gene transcription. hormone-mediated insulin secretion and ion-channel modulation.

In neurons. adenosine 39. 59-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is localized at postsynaptic densities by association of its regulatory subunit with an A kinase anchor protein. AKAP79. Interaction cloning experiments demonstrated that AKAP79 also binds protein phosphatase 2B. or calcineurin (CaN). A ternary complex of PKA. AKAP. and CaN was isolated from bovine brain. and colocalization of the kinase and the phosphatase was established in neurites of cultured hippocampal neurons. The putative CaN-binding domain of AKAP79 is similar to that of the immunophilin FKBP-12. and AKAP79 inhibited CaN phosphatase activity.

Similarly. in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3′.5′-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein. AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme. protein kinase C (PKC). binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus. AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,617,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/271/5255/1589.abstract,12172075387877945374,/scholar?cites=12172075387877945374,,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/klauck_sci_1996_p1589.pdf,0,0,0

AKAPs are a group of structurally diverse proteins with the common function of binding to the regulatory subunit of PKA and confining the holoenzyme to discrete locations within the cell. This mode of regulation ensures that PKA is exposed to isolated cAMP gradients. which allows for efficient catalytic activation and accurate substrate selection. Several AKAPs coordinate multiple members of signaling cascades. effectively assembling upstream activators and downstream effectors within the same macromolecular complex. Consequently. AKAPs may serve as points of integration for numerous signaling pathways.

In most cases the net signaling effect is to activate protein kinases or phosphoprotein phosphatases. which. in turn. alter the phosphorylation state of cellular target proteins. Although both enzyme classes have been intensely researched since the late 1950s. it is still unclear how individual hormones activate the correct pool of kinase or phosphatase to trigger specific intracellular events. One explanation that has recently attracted attention is a “targeting hypothesis” proposing that phosphorylation events are controlled in part by where kinases and phosphatases are located in the cell (1). In accordance with this proposal. it has become apparent that intracellular targeting of both enzyme classes is determined by association with “targeting subunits” or “anchoring proteins.” While there have been several general reviews on this subject (1–3). this article will focus on subcellular targeting of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). 1,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,317,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/dellacqua_jbc_1997_p12881.pdf,12087769256551720986,/scholar?cites=12087769256551720986,,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/dellacqua_jbc_1997_p12881.pdf,0,0,0

The WAVE-associated GTPase activating protein called WRP is implicated in human mental retardation. and WAVE-1 knock-out mice have altered behavior. Neuronal time-lapse imaging. behavioral analyses. and electrophysiological recordings from genetically modified mice were used to show that WAVE-1 signaling complexes control aspects of neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Gene targeting experiments in mice demonstrate that WRP anchoring to WAVE-1 is a homeostatic mechanism that contributes to neuronal development and the fidelity of synaptic connectivity.

A hormone binds its receptor. the receptor activates adenylate cyclase via an intermediary G protein. and CAMP is liberated from the intracellular face of the plasma membrane. This first part is relatively straightforward. but the next two steps in the process require a more sophisticated level of molecular organization. First of all. CAMP activates the CAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by binding to the regulatory subunits (R) of the dormant PKA holoenzyme and causes the release of the active catalytic subunit (C). Then comes the mysterious part. Although PKA is a multifunctional enzyme with a broad substrate specificity. hormonal activation of the kinase somehow permits preferential phosphorylation of specific target substrates.

In this report we demonstrate that the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP-Lbc assembles an activation complex for the lipid-dependent enzyme protein kinase D (PKD). Using a combination of biochemical. enzymatic. and immunofluorescence techniques. we show that the anchoring protein contributes to PKD activation in two ways: it recruits an upstream kinase PKCη and coordinates PKA phosphorylation events that release activated protein kinase D. Thus. AKAP-Lbc synchronizes PKA and PKC activities in a manner that leads to the activation of a third kinase.

At the MAM. these chaperones control ER homeostasis but also play a role in the onset of ER stress-mediated apoptosis. likely through the modulation of ER calcium signaling. These opposing roles of MAM-localized chaperones suggest the existence of mechanisms that regulate the composition and the properties of ER membrane domains. Our results now show that the GTPase Rab32 localizes to the ER and mitochondria. and we identify this protein as a regulator of MAM properties. Consistent with such a role.

An attractive mechanism for expression of long term depression is the loss of surface AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazale-4-propionate) receptors at synapses. Here we show that a threshold level of NMDA receptor activation must be exceeded to trigger a stable loss of AMPA receptors from the surface of cultured hippocampal neurons.

AKAP79 brings together different combinations of enzyme binding partners to customize the regulation of effector proteins. In neurons. muscarinic agonists mobilize an AKAP79-anchored pool of PKC that phosphorylates the KCNQ2 subunit of the M channel. This inhibits potassium permeability to enhance neuronal excitability. Using a dual fluorescent imaging/patch-clamp technique. we visualized AKAP79-anchored PKC phosphorylation of the kinase activity reporter CKAR concurrently with electrophysiological changes in KCNQ2 channels to show that AKAP79 synchronizes both signaling events to optimize the attenuation of M currents.

Mechanistic understanding of this process is hampered by limited structural information on these macromolecular complexes. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) spatially constrain phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA). Electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions of type-II PKA-AKAP18γ complexes reveal hetero-pentameric assemblies that adopt a range of flexible tripartite configurations. Intrinsically disordered regions within each PKA regulatory subunit impart the molecular plasticity that affords an ∼16 nanometer radius of motion to the associated catalytic subunits. Manipulating flexibility within the PKA holoenzyme augmented basal and cAMP responsive phosphorylation of AKAP-associated substrates. Cell-based analyses suggest that the catalytic subunit remains within type-II PKA-AKAP18γ complexes upon cAMP elevation. We propose that the dynamic movement of kinase sub-structures. in concert with the static AKAP-regulatory subunit interface. generates a solid-state signaling microenvironment for substrate phosphorylation.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01319.001,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:otzGkya1bYkC,95,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01319,10660568462838606096,/scholar?cites=10660568462838606096,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01319.pdf,0,0,0

We now demonstrate that two alternatively spliced forms of mAKAP are expressed: mAKAPα and mAKAPβ. The longer form. mAKAPα. is preferentially expressed in the brain. mAKAPβ is a shorter form of the anchoring protein that lacks the first 244 amino acids and is preferentially expressed in the heart. The unique amino terminus of mAKAPα can spatially restrict the activity of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrate that simultaneous recruitment of PDK1 and ERK onto mAKAPα facilitates activation and release of the downstream target p90RSK.

AKAP79 facilitates PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser845 on GluR1 to potentiate AMPA receptor function (Colledge et al.. 2000). Likewise.

A burgeoning knowledge of compartmentalized cAMP signaling is revealing how the local control of signaling enzyme activity impacts upon disease. The aim of this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster is to highlight how misregulation of local cyclic AMP signaling can have pathophysiological consequences.

A key component is the aquaporin‐0 (AQP0) water channel whose permeability is tightly regulated in healthy lenses. Using a variety of cellular and biochemical approaches we have discovered that products of the A‐kinase anchoring protein 2 gene (AKAP2/AKAP‐KL) form a stable complex with AQP0 to sequester protein kinase A (PKA) with the channel. This permits PKA phosphorylation of serine 235 within a calmodulin (CaM)‐binding domain of AQP0.

70795,Coordination of cAMP signaling events through PKA anchoring,1999,John D Scott and Mark L DelľAcqua and Iain DC Fraser and Steven J Tavalin and Linda B Lester,47,,,175-207,Academic Press,Mechanisms must clearly exist to organize the correct repertoire of signaling molecules into coordinated units that allow only a subset of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) substrates to become phosphorylated. One mechanism involves the restriction of PKA to localized sites of action where it can only phosphorylate those substrates in its immediate vicinity. This is achieved in one of the two ways; compartmentalized accumulation of the second messenger cAMP or anchoring of the kinase to subcellular structures and organelles. This chapter describes the accumulating data. suggesting that the subcellular location of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is regulated in part. through association with a family of A-kinase anchoring proteins called AKAPs.

We sought to compare the immune response of pregnant women to H1N1 infection versus vaccination and to determine the extent of passive immunity conferred to the newborn.   Methods/Findings During the 2009-2010 influenza season. we enrolled a cohort of women who either had confirmed pH1N1 infection during pregnancy. did not have pH1N1 during pregnancy but were vaccinated against pH1N1. or did not have illness or vaccination. Maternal and umbilical cord venous blood samples were collected at delivery. Hemagglutination inhibition assays (HAI) for pH1N1 were performed. Data were analyzed using linear regression analyses. HAIs were performed for matched maternal/cord blood pairs for 16 women with confirmed pH1N1 infection. 14 women vaccinated against pH1N1. and 10 women without infection or vaccination. We found that pH1N1 vaccination and wild-type infection during pregnancy did not differ with respect to (1) HAI titers at delivery. (2) HAI antibody decay slopes over time. and (3) HAI titers in the cord blood.   Conclusions Vaccination against pH1N1 confers a similar HAI antibody response as compared to pH1N1 infection during pregnancy. both in quantity and quality.

70804,Subcellular targeting of kinases and phosphatases by association with bifunctional anchoring proteins,1995,VM Coghlan and ZE Hausken and JD Scott,23,,3,592-596,Portland Press Ltd.,Since the discovery by Sutherland and colleagues [l-31 of cyclic AMP as an intracellular second messenger for hormone-mediated events. considerable research has focused on understanding its action. A key step in this process was the discovery by Fischer and Krebs that cyclic AMP. M $+ and ATP were factors affecting the activity of phosphorylase b kinase [4]. which led to the discovery of a cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)[51. Since then. it has been demonstrated that 20 or more different hormones activate PKA through a common signalling pathway that elevates intracellular cyclic AMP [6-81.PKA is a multifunctional enzyme with a broad substrate specificity. It is therefore hard to imagine how the kinase is able to phosphorylate the correct target proteins rapidly and preferentially in response to activation by individual hormones. This is particularly true if one considers PKA as a soluble enzyme freely diffusing throughout the cytoplasm. Under these conditions. elevation of cyclic AMP concentration would cause an indiscriminate burst of phosphorylation. Thus a preferred hypothesis is that PKA is compartmentalized and individual hormones preferentially activate specific pools of kinase that are co-localized with substrate proteins (Figure 1). Consequently. the localization of PKA may be a key regulatory event in determining the intracellular sites of hormone action. Support for PKA compartmentalization is provided by three lines of evidence: different hormones activate specific PKA subtypes [9]. cyclic AMP accumulates in distinct cellular compartments [lo]. and PKA subunits are detected in different cellular compartments [11.121 …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC,32,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6357/5322731023e5cdd60169051869a451048b00.pdf,18333416390781051051,/scholar?cites=18333416390781051051,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6357/5322731023e5cdd60169051869a451048b00.pdf,0,0,0

Protein phosphorylation is a reversible process involving two classes of signalling enzymes: protein kinases. which catalyse the phospho-transfer reaction. and phosphoprotein phosphatases. which catalyse the dephosphorylation step [1. 2]. The activity of both enzyme classes is tightly regulated and responds to fluctuations in diffusible second messengers such as Ca2+. phospholipid and cAMP [2]. The predominant effect of cAMP is to activate the CAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). which modifies serine and threonine residues on substrate proteins [3]. Since PKA has a broad substrate specificity and is present in relatively high intracellular concentrations [4]. it is critical to restrict the activity of the enzyme and its substrate availability …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C,29,https://portlandpress.com/biochemsoctrans/article-abstract/24/4/986/93658,13021504240665736094,/scholar?cites=13021504240665736094,,,0,0,0

Reabsorption of water from the luminal fluid of the nephron occurs through aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water pores in principal cells that line the kidney-collecting duct.

NY,Synthesis of the second messenger cAMP activates a variety of signaling pathways critical for all facets of intracellular regulation. Protein kinase A (PKA) is the major cAMP-responsive effector. Where and when this enzyme is activated has profound implications on the cellular role of PKA. A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs) play a critical role in this process by orchestrating spatial and temporal aspects of PKA action. A popular means of evaluating the impact of these anchored signaling events is to biochemically interfere with the PKA–AKAP interface. Hence. peptide disruptors of PKA anchoring are valuable tools in the investigation of local PKA action.

A-kinase anchoring protein 220 (AKAP220) is a multivalent anchoring protein that can sequester a variety of signal transduction enzymes. These include protein kinase A (PKA) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Using a combination of molecular and cellular approaches we show that GSK3β phosphorylation of Thr-1132 on AKAP220 initiates recruitment of this kinase into the enzyme scaffold. We also find that AKAP220 anchors GSK3β and its substrate β-catenin in membrane ruffles. Interestingly. GSK3β can be released from the multienzyme complex in response to PKA phosphorylation on serine 9. which suppresses GSK3β activity. The signaling scaffold may enhance this regulatory mechanism. as AKAP220 has the capacity to anchor two PKA holoenzymes.

The PKA holoenzyme is targeted to specific subcellular sites through the interaction of the regulatory subunits with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). We previously reported that FSH regulates expression of AKAPs. In this report we examine the relationship between AKAP expression and cell shape. Granulosa cells cultured in the absence of FSH tend to spread and flatten. Cell spreading is accompanied by an increased expression of a 140-kDa AKAP. This spreading/flattening phenotype is independent of the specific extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin. polylysine. and gelatin) on which cells are plated.

70842,Therapeutic strategies for anchored kinases and phosphatases: exploiting short linear motifs and intrinsic disorder,2015,Patrick J Nygren and John D Scott,6,,,158,Frontiers,Phosphorylation events that occur in response to the second messenger cAMP are controlled spatially and temporally by protein kinase A (PKA) interacting with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Recent advances in understanding the structural basis for this interaction have reinforced the hypothesis that AKAPs create spatially constrained signaling microdomains. This has led to the realization that the PKA/AKAP interface is a potential drug target for modulating a plethora of cell-signaling events. Pharmacological disruption of kinase-AKAP interactions has previously been explored for disease treatment and remains an interesting area of research. However. disrupting or enhancing the association of phosphatases with AKAPs is a therapeutic concept of equal promise. particularly since they oppose the actions of many anchored kinases. Accordingly. numerous AKAPs bind phosphatases such as PP1. calcineurin (PP2B). and PP2A. These multimodal signaling hubs are equally able to control the addition of phosphate groups onto target substrates. as well as the removal of these phosphate groups. In this review. we describe recent advances in structural analysis of kinase and phosphatase interactions with AKAPs. and suggest future possibilities for targeting these interactions for therapeutic benefit.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C,21,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2015.00158/full,2780353962831438288,/scholar?cites=2780353962831438288,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2015.00158/full,0,0,0

Lorente de Nó (’81) recognized that the cortex of the nucleus (layers 1 and 2) bore a remarkable resemblance to the cerebellum. in both the structural characteristics of the cells and their organization. The chief organization of the nucleus is based on a concentric laminar arrangement of cells. their dendrites. and fiber systems. somewhat like a single cerebellar folium. A local cartesian framework can be imposed on the nucleus. where the principal axes are depth (perpendicular to the local surface). the striai axis (parallel to the long axis of the nucleus and to the unmyelinated parallel fibers in the molecular layer). and the transstriai axis (parallel to the isofrequency planes formed by the auditory nerve fibers).

Conformational flexibility in regions of intrinsic disorder within A-kinase anchoring protein 79 (AKAP79) delineates PP2B access to phosphoproteins. Structural analysis by negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) reveals an ensemble of dormant AKAP79-PP2B configurations varying in particle length from 160 to 240 Å. A short-linear interaction motif between residues 337–343 of AKAP79 is the sole PP2B-anchoring determinant sustaining these diverse topologies. Activation with Ca2+/calmodulin engages additional interactive surfaces and condenses these conformational variants into a uniform population with mean length 178 ± 17 Å. This includes a Leu-Lys-Ile-Pro sequence (residues 125–128 of AKAP79) that occupies a binding pocket on PP2B utilized by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin.

The protein kinase A–anchoring protein dAKAP1 compartmentalizes protein kinase A (PKA) and other signaling enzymes at the outer mitochondrial membrane and thereby controls mitochondrial function and dynamics. Modulation of these processes occurs in part through regulation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1).

We exploited the AKAP targeting concept to create genetically encoded platforms that restrain kinase inhibitor drugs at distinct subcellular locations. Local Kinase Inhibition (LoKI) allows us to ascribe organelle-specific functions to broad specificity kinases.

FLCs uniquely produce DNAJ-PKAc. a chimeric enzyme consisting of a chaperonin-binding domain fused to the Cα subunit of protein kinase A. Biochemical analyses of clinical samples reveal that a unique property of this fusion enzyme is the ability to recruit heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). This cellular chaperonin is frequently up-regulated in cancers. Gene-editing of mouse hepatocytes generated disease-relevant AML12DNAJ-PKAc cell lines. Further analyses indicate that the proto-oncogene A-kinase anchoring protein-Lbc is up-regulated in FLC and functions to cluster DNAJ-PKAc/Hsp70 sub-complexes with a RAF-MEK-ERK kinase module. Drug screening reveals Hsp70 and MEK inhibitor combinations that selectively block proliferation of AML12DNAJ-PKAc cells. Phosphoproteomic profiling demonstrates that DNAJ-PKAc biases the signaling landscape toward ERK activation and engages downstream kinase cascades. Thus. the oncogenic action of DNAJ-PKAc involves an acquired scaffolding function that permits recruitment of Hsp70 and mobilization of local ERK signaling.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:AFXcoJnoRH0C,9,https://elifesciences.org/articles/44187,5567676070751686907,/scholar?cites=5567676070751686907,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/44187.pdf,0,0,0

70905,Drugs that regulate local cell signaling: AKAP targeting as a therapeutic option,2021,Paula J Bucko and John D Scott,61,,,361-379,Annual Reviews,Cells respond to environmental cues by mobilizing signal transduction cascades that engage protein kinases and phosphoprotein phosphatases. Correct organization of these enzymes in space and time enables the efficient and precise transmission of chemical signals. The cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A is compartmentalized through its association with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). AKAPs are a family of multivalent scaffolds that constrain signaling enzymes and effectors at subcellular locations to drive essential physiological events. More recently. it has been recognized that defective signaling in certain endocrine disorders and cancers proceeds through pathological AKAP complexes. Consequently. pharmacologically targeting these macromolecular complexes unlocks new therapeutic opportunities for a growing number of clinical indications.

We identified a Caenorhabditis elegans RhoGEF protein. RHGF-2. as a binding partner of the C. elegans multi-PDZ domain scaffold protein MPZ-1 (MUPP1 in mammals). RHGF-2 exhibits significant identity to the mammalian RhoGEFs PLEKHG5/Tech/Syx and contains a class I C-terminal PDZ binding motif (SDV) that interacts most strongly to MPZ-1 PDZ domain eight. RHGF-2 RhoGEF activity is specific to the C. elegans RhoA homolog RHO-1 as determined by direct binding. GDP/GTP exchange and serum response element-driven reporter activity. rhgf-2 is an essential gene since rhgf-2 deletion mutants do not elongate during embryogenesis and hatch as short immobile animals that arrest development. Interestingly. the expression of a functional rhgf-2:: gfp transgene appears to be exclusively neuronal and rhgf-2 overexpression results in loopy movement with exaggerated body bends.

Restriction of enzyme location contributes to the fidelity of each cellular response. A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) target the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and other signalling enzymes to defined subcellular locations. We have developed a new strategy that combines RNA interference of the endogenous protein and replacement with AKAP79/150 forms unable to anchor selected binding partners. Using this approach we show that AKAP79/150 coordinates different enzyme combinations to modulate the activity of two distinct neuronal ion channels: AMPA-type glutamate receptors and M-type potassium channels. Utilization of distinct enzyme combinations in this manner provides a means to expand the repertoire of cellular events that the same AKAP modulates.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C,5,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171933506000069,13326033719219959682,/scholar?cites=13326033719219959682,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.422.2248&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

70955,A-Kinase-Anchoring Protein–Lbc Connects Stress Signaling to Cardiac Hypertrophy,2013,F Donelson Smith and John D Scott,33,Molecular and cellular biology,1,2-3,American Society for Microbiology Journals,Heart failure often occurs as a consequence of persistent trauma to the myocardium. Cardiovascular pathologies. including hypertension. valvular disease. atherosclerosis. and ischemia. can all lead to pressure overload and myocardial dysfunction. In the face of such stressors. the heart attempts to maintain normal contractile function by initiating a complex remodeling process involving the reexpression of developmental genes. This process leads to an increase in cardiac muscle mass commonly referred to as pathological cardiac hypertrophy. If trauma is persistent or severe. such compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed or become maladaptive and heart failure ensues. Stress signaling pathways play an important role in cellular responses to cardiotoxic insults such as mechanical shear and an overabundance of proinflammatory molecules.

PCHIS is a hybrid electronic-paper medical record system that is clinically useful to health care providers. The paper chart still contains the bulk of information but the key facts about any given patient (diagnoses. surgeries. medications. allergies) and about the process of care (frequency of visits. referral patterns. test ordering. etc.) are readily available in electronic form. These key data are easily coded. are quickly and simultaneously accessible in multiple locations. serve as an excellent chart substitute whenever the paper chart is unavailable. and can be retrieved for in-depth analysis at any time. whether for clinical. administrative. research. or quality assurance purposes. The process of care can be studied and. to some extent. can also be modified by the system. as demonstrated by the physician response to the reminder system within PCHIS. The medical record chart summary. mandated by Joint Commission for ambulatory patient charts. is easily provided in hard copy as well as electronically. Whereas physician compliance in providing data to the system was initially sporadic. physician support has increased tremendously as the system has become more clinically useful to them. It is a system that exists and functions well within a patchwork of multiple different medical information systems. It is a system with sufficient intrinsic flexibility that it can and will continue to evolve in response to the needs of physicians and administrators.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:w0odbtu79TwC,3,https://europepmc.org/article/med/10119974,15751317440795306393,/scholar?cites=15751317440795306393,,,0,0,0

NY,Classical physiological experiments identified cAMP as a diffusible intracellular secondary messenger capable of activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). These studies defined hormone-and location-specific patterns of PKA activation. suggesting that PKA signaling was compartmentalized. For example. in perfused rat cardiomyocytes. adrenergic stimulation selectively activates a pool of PKA isolated from certain fractions. while prostanoids predominately activate cytosolic PKA (Scott et al. 2013). The first AKAP to be identified. microtubuleassociated protein 2 (MAP2). was copurified with the PKA regulatory subunit subtype II (RII) from rat brain extracts. Over 50 additional AKAP family members have subsequently been identified (Fraser and Scott 1999; Scott et al. 2013). AKAPs are structurally diverse and share little primary sequence similarity. but are functionally similar and are classified by their ability to copurify with PKA catalytic activity from tissues (Langeberg and Scott 2015).,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:zUl2_INMlC4C,2,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/gabrovsek_and_bucko_EncySigol_2017_p1.pdf,7955957556022904277,/scholar?cites=7955957556022904277,,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/gabrovsek_and_bucko_EncySigol_2017_p1.pdf,0,0,0

Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers. Inc.. Atlanta. GA (United States),Manufactured products. such as fenestration systems and the materials comprising the systems. are often observed to degrade due to exposure to the elements of weather. While standard and nonstandard methods have been developed to provide a means of assessing the effect of weathering. questions often arise concerning the relationship of resultant test data with actual in-service performance. In view of the questions concerning the relevance of test data and the rapidly growing focus on quality assurance. there is strong interest in developing improved test protocols. This paper focuses on the key choices that must be made in the design of weathering tests and includes identification of the currently available methods used for weathering of fenestration systems and the primary shortcomings of those methods.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:8RAEygVn5_EC,2,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/211857,10575171859048917065,/scholar?cites=10575171859048917065,,,0,0,0

AChR clusters were observed from 16 – 72 hours after treatment when Z+ agrin was adsorbed to the surface of microparticles. but this time frame was extended to 120 hours and beyond when agrin was covalently linked to the microparticle surface. Similar AChR clustering was observed both when covalent agrin microparticles were allowed to settle from a culture medium suspension above a cell-seeded fibrin surface and when C2C12 cells were seeded on an agrin microparticle-containing fibrin surface. The latter microparticle delivery method enabled construction of 3D agrin-presenting fibrin scaffolds. which …",True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:AzKEL7Gb_04C,1,https://dspace.zsr.wfu.edu/handle/10339/57186,2836448415208124166,/scholar?cites=2836448415208124166,,https://dspace.zsr.wfu.edu/bitstream/handle/10339/57186/Scott_wfu_0248D_10761.pdf,0,0,0

Signal specificity is achieved through local activation of signaling enzymes that are anchored to subcellular organelles and membranes. In particular. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) coordinate and control cAMP responsive events. AKAPs were originally classified based on their ability to bind cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A; PKA). The activity of PKA is regulated by its two regulatory subunits. which from a dimer that binds to the two catalytic subunits. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory dimer dissociates the catalytic subunits and activates PKA. Anchoring of PKA by AKAPs constrains PKA activity to a relevant subset of potential substrates. Thus.

NY,Maintaining a steady balance between energy production and consumption is a cornerstone of all living cells. Failure to maintain this balance affects most. if not all. cellular activities as these processes are normally tightly coupled to the energy status of the cell. It is beginning to emerge that human diseases such as obesity. Type 2 diabetes. and even certain types of cancer may be linked to underlying defects in the regulation of energy balance. Since the evolution of eukaryotes. the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) system has played a pivotal role in maintaining energy homeostasis by regulating the enzymes that control flux through virtually every branch of metabolism. AMPK functions primarily as a fuel gauge monitoring the ratio of AMP to ATP. which can be regarded as a molecular read-out of cellular energy status. It becomes activated when energy utilisation overtakes energy production. and …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-6382-6_9,8019969209292040255,/scholar?cites=8019969209292040255,,,0,0,0

The myosin light chain kinases comprise a family of tissue-specific isozymes whose function is to phosphorylate one of the light chain components. the P- or DTNB-light chain. of myosin. Distinct isozyme forms of Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MLCK) have been identified in skeletal. cardiac and smooth muscle. In addition. MLCK has been detected in nonmuscle tisues such as brain. T-cells. platelets and cultured fibroblasts. All of the isozymes share several properties in common.

Functional upregulation of LTCCs under hyperglycemic conditions involves cAMP‐dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity. yet the mechanistic details of how these pathological phenomena promote vasoconstriction is unclear. Here. we report that a subpopulation of CaV1.2 channels is located within nanometer proximity of PKA catalytic subunits at the sarcolemma of native murine and human arterial myocytes. This organization requires selective scaffolding of PKA RIIα by A‐kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150; murine ortholog of human AKAP79).

Endothelial-dependent vasodilation by classic agents such as acetylcholine (ACh) depends on an elevation of EC Ca2+. and can act through the generation of nitric oxide (NO). An elevation of EC Ca2+ also activates small-and intermediate-conductance (SK and IK) potassium channels. This leads to endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (“EDH”). which is spread through gap junctions in specialized EC projections to adjacent smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to cause vasodilation of small resistance arteries and arterioles. and this pathway is responsible for the majority of the ACh-induced dilation in resistance arteries [1].

The scaffolding protein AKAP150 is a key regulator of calcineurin (CaN). a phosphatase known to modulate expression of the regulatory BKCa β1 subunit. Whether AKAP150 mediates BKCa channel suppression during hyperglycemia and diabetes is unknown.Objective: To test the hypothesis that AKAP150-dependent CaN signaling mediates BKCa β1 downregulation and impaired vascular BKCa channel function during hyperglycemia and diabetes.Methods and Results: We found that AKAP150 is an important determinant of BKCa channel remodeling. CaN/NFATc3 activation. and resistance artery constriction in hyperglycemic animals on high fat diet (HFD). Genetic ablation of AKAP150 protected against these alterations. including augmented vasoconstriction. D-glucose-dependent suppression of BKCa channel β1 subunits required Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels and mobilization of a CaN/NFATc3 signaling pathway. Remarkably. HFD mice expressing a mutant AKAP150 unable to anchor CaN resisted activation of NFATc3 and downregulation of BKCa β1 subunits. and attenuated HFD-induced elevation in arterial blood pressure.Conclusions: Our results support a model whereby subcellular anchoring of CaN by AKAP150 is a key molecular determinant of vascular BKCa channel remodeling. which contributes to vasoconstriction during diabetes.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/43030220/AKAP150_Contributes_to_Enhanced_Vascular20160224-26002-1sapynr.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43030220/AKAP150_Contributes_to_Enhanced_Vascular20160224-26002-1sapynr.pdf,0,0,0

Increased β‐ adrenergic signaling after myocardial infarction (MI) triggers activation of the Ca2+‐dependent phosphatase calcineurin and the transcription factor NFATc3. resulting in down‐regulation of voltage‐gated K+ (KV) channel in ventricular myocytes. Here we tested the hypothesis that AKAP150 targeting of calcineurin to the sarcolemma is required for NFATc3 activation and the subsequent down‐regulation of KV currents observed after MI. We found that ablation of AKAP150 decreased NFATc3 nuclear translocation and was protective against down‐regulation of KV currents after MI.

When individuals with autism. intellectual. and communication disabilities become victims of crime. communicating effectively with these individuals can present challenges to law enforcement. especially in a crisis situation when the need to communicate effectively is critical. A law enforcement officer’s general lack of understanding of and ability to communicate with individuals with disabilities puts those individuals at greater risk. The ability for law enforcement personnel to understand and communicate with individuals with autism. intellectual. and communication disabilities is a critical step in reducing victimization.

Prasad V …,2010,John D Scott and Carmen W Dessauer,,,,,,Spatiotemporal specificity of cAMP action is best explained by targeting protein kinase A (PKA) to its substrates by A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). At synapses in the brain AKAP79/150 incorporates PKA and other regulatory enzymes into signal transduction networks that include βadrenergic receptors. α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. We previously showed that AKAP79/150 clusters PKA with type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5) to assemble a negative feedback loop in which the anchored kinase phosphorylates AC5 to dynamically suppress cAMP synthesis. We now show that AKAP79 can associate with multiple AC isoforms. The N-terminal regions of AC 5. 6. and 9 mediate this protein-protein interaction. Mapping studies located a reciprocal binding surface between residues 77-108 of AKAP79. Intensity-and lifetime-based Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) demonstrated that deletion of AKAP7977-108 region abolished AC5/AKAP79 interaction in living cells. Addition of the AKAP7977-153 polypeptide fragment uncouples AC5/6 interactions with the anchoring protein and prevents PKA-mediated inhibition of AC activity in membranes. Use of the AKAP7977-153 polypeptide fragment in brain extracts from wild type and AKAP150-/-mice reveals that loss of the anchoring protein results in decreased AMPA receptor-associated AC activity. Thus we propose that AKAP79/150 mediates proteinprotein interactions that place AC5 in proximity to synaptic AMPA receptors.Localized activation of PKA triggers a plethora of intracellular signaling processes (1 …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:sJPMR1oEGYQC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fefb/b83886966e8fb436cdf143e9e22b59ad6111.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fefb/b83886966e8fb436cdf143e9e22b59ad6111.pdf,0,0,0

Recent studies have suggested that members of the IQ motif GTPase Activating Proteins (IQGAP) gene family are important modulators of the actin cytoskeleton that ultimately regulate processes such as polarity. cell migration and neurite outgrowth.

71148,Compartmentalization of Cyclic AMP Signalling,2006,JD Scott,34,Biochemical Society Transactions,part 4,,,Scaffolding proteins create order out of chaos. Multifunctional binding proteins such as the AKAPs (A-kinaseanchoring proteins) oversee the dynamic organization of signalling events by clustering activator proteins with kinases. phosphatases and phosphodiesterases and directing them toward their downstream effectors. This article will focus on the role of AKAPs in the spatial and temporal control of cAMP signalling events.Although the investigation of cAMP signalling has been underway for over 50 years. it was not until the early 1980s that the compartmentalized modulation of these events was appreciated. This concept developed from physiological experiments showing that stimulation of cAMP synthesis by different agonists produced distinct physiological outputs. even within the same cell. For example. adrenergic stimulation activated a particulate pool of PKA (protein kinase A or cAMP-dependent protein kinase) in cardiomyocytes. whereas stimulation with prostaglandin E1 activated a cytosolic pool of the enzyme [1]. These observations were compatible with previous evidence that the PKA holoenzyme. which consists of two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits. exists in two forms: a cytoplasmic type I PKA holoenzyme and a type II PKA holoenzyme that was considered to be particulate. This differential distribution of the PKA holoenzymes also implied that mechanisms were in place to segregate distinct cAMP signals. The development of fluorescent probes and advanced imaging techniques largely proved this hypothesis. For example. overexpressed rat olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. which have been modified to be …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:1xBWf43XMUgC,0,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/scott_biochem_soc_2006_p465.pdf,,,,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/scott_biochem_soc_2006_p465.pdf,0,0,0

Multiprotein signaling complexes create focal points of enzyme activity to disseminate the intracellular action of many hormones and neurotransmitters. The spatio-temporal activation of protein kinases and/or phosphatases is important in controlling where and when phosphorylaton events occur. Anchoring proteins and targeting subunits provide a molecular framework that orients protein kinases and phosphatases toward selected substrates. Prototypic examples of these “signal-directing molecules” are A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that sustain multicomponent signaling complexes of the cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) and G proteins and other enzymes.

AKAP79. is a multivalent anchoring protein that maintains the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. protein kinase C. and protein phosphatase-2B (PP2B/calcineurin) at the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses where it is recruited into complexes with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-subtype glutamate receptors. We have used cellular targeting of AKAP79 truncation and deletion mutants as an assay to map the PP2B-binding site on AKAP79.

So. on a recent flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong I read Protein Modules in Cellular Signaling. a compendium of 43 articles on various aspects of signal transduction. edited by Ludwig Heilmeyer and Peter Friedrich. This book focuses on recent advances in understanding the cellular signalling pathways that relay information from the cell surface to target proteins located at discrete sites within the cell. An enigmatic yet fundamental principle of signal transduction is that parallel signalling pathways operate with a common repertoire of enzymes to propagate diverse physiological responses. One explanation is that signalling cascades are highly organized into localized transduction units. each tailored to respond optimally to a particular signal.

The core of the model is the distribution of pinning and coercive energies due to the polycrystalline nature of the material. Also. because domain nucleation for thin-films seem to be surface dominant. and surface space-charges are usually present. the model assumes that the pinning energies are field activated due to surface screening effects. The model is based on the well known two-state cluster theory in statistical physics. Further results from the model include the log (t) dependence of fatigue as a direct consequence of a gaussian distribution of pinning energies. And. for the first time a theoretical description of the V'dependence of fatigue is also described.

71201,Down regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity at mitosis may involve phosphorylation of regulatory subunits by members of the CDK family,1996,LAMB Ned and SCOTT John and FERNANDEZ Anne,88,Biology of the Cell,1-2,73,No longer published by Elsevier,Inactivation of interphase events involving CAMP-dependent protein kinase plays an important role in activation of mammalian cells into mitosis. Overexpression of A-kin&se catalytic activity effectively compromises mitotic entry whereas an inactivation of the kinase through microinjection of specific peptide inhibitor induces morphological changes similar to those observed during early prophase. Inhibition of A-kinase also acts in a synergistic manner with cdc2 in the induction of lamin breakdown in mammalian cells. Whereas PKI is a potential candidate for inducing these changes. it is both highly sensitive to intracellular proteases and poorly expressed by either northern blotting or immunological methods. We have therefore examined the alternative possibility that A-kinase down regulation at mitosis is brought about by the endogenous regulatory subunits. We show that both RI or RI1 can be directly phosphorylated by different members of the cdk family at a site implicated in CAMP binding. Moreover. this phosphorylation can be detected in vivo and occurs coincidentally with mitotic entry. The microinjection of two mutant forms of RII. one mutated at the cdk phosphorylation site and the other mutated at both CAMP binding sites. induce effects on cell morphology and cytoskeleton similar to those observed with microinjection of PKI. Taken together. these data suggest that the inhibition of CAMP binding to the regulatory subunits via &-mediated direct phosphorylation of R subunits. may play an important role in the induction of mitosis in mammalian cells.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/48309799/S0248-4900_2897_2986859-120160825-6319-qpap9l.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48309799/S0248-4900_2897_2986859-120160825-6319-qpap9l.pdf,0,0,0

These involve load variations and system faults. That has to be sorted out before a power system engineer accepts MHD into his system. A major factor in power system planning is the availability of the power plant as determined by its reliability and maintenance needs. This availability depends on the reliability not only of the generator. but on the auxiliary and downstream components. as well as. the power inverters conditioning system. Another most important factor is the need to design the power conditioning and control system with a clear understanding of what the power system requires and what undesired conditions the power system imposes on it. MHD generator characteristics and power conditioning system performances must be matched to power system demands and characteristics. Within this context. the paper assesses design requirements relative to the following areas: steady state power supply; dynamic and transient conditions. functions of the power conditioning system.

Oxford University Press,This short paperback book relates animal behavior to ecology and the phenomena of population growth and regulation. Davis has deliberately omit-ted extensive treatment of individual behavior. and his first two chapters are essentially a very brief introduction to sensory phenomena. Chapter 3 discusses the changing factors in the habitat to which an animal must adjust. and Chapter 4 points out that animals. through their adaptive behavior and movement. are able to escape from the restric-tions of their habitats. and in general evolve toward controlling and modi-fying the environment. Chapter 5 takes up social behavior and the resultant organization of populations. chiefly with respect to territories and dominance hierarchies.All of this is essentially introductory to chapters on the regulation and survival of populations.

Another cause is. that the Excise has not. and still does not. avail itself sufficiently of the great and ascertained ad-vantages derived from the publication of the names and addresses of adulterators or sellers of adulterated articles. In proof of this statement. the fact may be cited. that in the course of a whole year scarcely a dozen cases of adulteration are brought by the Excise under the notice of the public.

September 23rd. full of years and honour. there passed away at the age of 75. George Cursham. MD Paris. FRCP Long will Dr. Cursham be mourned and his memory affectionately cherished by those who were admitted to the privilege of his intimate acquaintance. Dr. Cursham's high principle and unfailing rectitude. combined with his clear judgment. made him highly respected by his professional brethren. who must feel that one has gone forth from amongst them whose place will not easily be filled. Dr. Cursham was for many years Physician to the Brompton Consumption Hospital and to the Asylum for Female Orphans; he was also for some years Secretary to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. and held up to the time of his death the post of Inspector of Anatomy to the provincial schools.JOHN SCOTT. FRCS ED.. OF CULROSS. IT is the wish of some medical men to die in harness. but it is seldom that such is so fully carried out as in the sudden and sad death of Mr. John Scott of Culross. He went out on the morning of the 15th August apparently in good health. and had visited one or two of his patients and was on his way to see another. when he felt the first symptoms of the fatal seizure. After three such warnings he came out of his gig. told his boy not to leave him. and lay down by the road-side and died.

part of the letter written by Mr. West in your JOURNAL of the 8th inst. But. at the same time. there

PKC and protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin that regulates phosphorylation pathways underlying neuronal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) synaptic plasticity. AKAP79/150 postsynaptic targeting requires three N-terminal basic domains that bind F-actin and acidic phospholipids. Here we report a novel interaction of these domains with cadherin adhesion molecules that are linked to actin through β-catenin (β-cat) at neuronal synapses and epithelial adherens junctions. Mapping the AKAP binding site in cadherins identified overlap with β-cat binding; however. no competition between AKAP and β-cat binding to cadherins was detected in vitro. Accordingly. AKAP79/150 exhibited polarized localization with β-cat and cadherins in epithelial cell lateral membranes. and β-cat was present in AKAP-cadherin complexes …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:9LpHyFPp1DQC,0,https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/prev/20180314-aop/pdf/10.1091/mbc.e05-02-0134,,,,,0,0,0

While the repetition rate of the Quantel pump lasers in the final Gemini amplifier limits TA3 operations to 0.05 Hz. TA2 can be operated at 5 Hz. Until now TA2 has reduced the repetition rate to a maximum of 1 Hz because of the practical challenges of increasing to the full capability. In this report we address these issues and describe the first experimental campaign conducted with the full 5 Hz repetition rate.

The transmitted laser and electron beam generated in a laser-driven plasma wakefield accelerator are clearly observed to depend on the gas jet backing pressure. The spectral properties of these beams are seen to be smooth functions of the input parameters. when averaging over a set 49 shots for each value and employing gradual changes in pressure. This allows for detailed examination of the interaction physics. and can better reveal threshold behaviour and highly localised optima.

71262,AKAP150-dependent cooperative TRPV4 channel gating is central to,,Michael I Kotlikoff Hill-Eubanks and John D Scott and Luis F Santana and T Mark,,,,,,Endothelial cell dysfunction. characterized by a diminished response to endothelial cell–dependent vasodilators. is a hallmark of hypertension. TRPV4 channels play a major role in endothelial-dependent vasodilation. a function mediated by local Ca2+ influx through clusters of functionally coupled TRPV4 channels rather than by a global increase in endothelial cell Ca2+. We showed that stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on endothelial cells of mouse arteries exclusively activated TRPV4 channels that were localized at myoendothelial projections (MEPs). specialized regions of endothelial cells that contact smooth muscle cells. Muscarinic receptor–mediated activation of TRPV4 depended on protein kinase C (PKC) and the PKC-anchoring protein AKAP150. which was concentrated at MEPs. Cooperative opening of clustered TRPV4 channels specifically amplified Ca2+ influx at MEPs. Cooperativity of TRPV4 channels at non-MEP sites was much lower. and cooperativity at MEPs was greatly reduced by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ or AKAP150 knockout. suggesting that Ca2+ entering through adjacent channels underlies the AKAP150-dependent potentiation of TRPV4 activity. In a mouse model of angiotensin II–induced hypertension. MEP localization of AKAP150 was disrupted. muscarinic receptor stimulation did not activate TRPV4 channels. cooperativity among TRPV4 channels at MEPs was weaker. and vasodilation in response to muscarinic receptor stimulation was reduced. Thus. endothelial-dependent dilation of resistance arteries is enabled by MEP-localized AKAP150. which ensures the proximity of PKC to TRPV4 …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:1r-w4gtu6w8C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/43929362/AKAP150-dependent_cooperative_TRPV4_chan20160320-22940-1i1oex0.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43929362/AKAP150-dependent_cooperative_TRPV4_chan20160320-22940-1i1oex0.pdf,0,0,0

His discovery of protein phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism (with Edmond Fischer) touched all aspects of biomedical science and profoundly influenced therapeutic approaches now widely used in clinical care. Ed’s life story epitomizes his commitment to family and colleagues. excellence in research and service to the biochemical community. Ed Krebs was born in Lansing. Iowa. on June 6. 1918. the son of a Presbyterian minister and a schoolteacher. His father died suddenly when Ed was 15 and. at the height of the Great Depression. the family moved to Urbana. Ill.. for financial reasons. It was there that Krebs completed high school and earned a degree in chemistry from the University of Illinois in 1940. As an undergraduate. he became enamored with organic chemistry but eventually chose to become a physician. largely because he won a scholarship to attend Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The principal responsibility of a medical school during the war years was to train physicians for the armed forces. However. Krebs also was encouraged to participate in “medical research.” After graduating from medical school in 1943 and doing 18 months of residency training in internal medicine at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis. Krebs went on active duty as a medical officer in the Navy. After being discharged from the Navy in 1946. Krebs returned to St. Louis with plans of becoming an academic internist.

Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis. with approximately 50% of patients with compensated cirrhosis developing ascites over the course of 10 years. After developing ascites that necessitates hospitalization. the risk of mortality increases to 15% at 1 year and nearly 50% at 5 years. Complications following the development of ascites include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. dilutional hyponatremia. refractory ascites. hepatic hydrothorax. and hepatorenal syndrome.

Existing biomaterial technologies are not designed to provide physical guidance cues to regenerating axons–a design parameter that is known to be important in promoting neural regeneration [2]. We hypothesize that implantable biomaterial scaffolds can be patterned to provide optimal physical guidance cues for regenerating axons. To test this hypothesis. we have employed an embryonic chicken dorsal root ganglia (DRG) model to evaluate scaffold performance in vitro. Our key goal is to promote rapid axon growth through the scaffold. as swift reinnervation of targets lessens the likelihood of neuromuscular junction atrophy and permanent loss of function [3]. To this end. we have evaluated scaffold performance by quantifying maximum axon length.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:LdasjJ6CEcoC,0,http://www.termis.org/docs/abstracts/am2010/1098.pdf,,,,http://www.termis.org/docs/abstracts/am2010/1098.pdf,0,0,0

Both sPLA2s induced TNF-α and IL-6 release in a concentration-dependent manner by increasing their mRNA expression. This effect was independent of their enzymatic activity because 1) the capacity of sPLA2s to mobilize arachidonic acid from HLM was unrelated to their ability to induce cytokine production; and 2) two catalytically inactive isoforms of group IB sPLA2 (bromophenacyl bromide-inactivated human sPLA2 and the H48Q mutant of the porcine sPLA2) were as effective as the catalytically active sPLA2s in inducing cytokine production.

The much higher enzymatic activity of human group X sPLA2(hGX) compared with human group IIA sPLA2 (hGIIA) on phosphatidylcholine (PC)-rich vesicles is due in large part to the higher affinity of the former enzyme for such vesicles; this result also holds when vesicles contain cholesterol and sphingomyelin. The inclusion of anionic phosphatidylserine in PC vesicles dramatically enhances interfacial binding and catalysis of hGIIA but not of hGX. This is the result of the large number of lysine and arginine residues scattered over the entire surface of hGIIA. which cause the enzyme to form a supramolecular aggregate with multiple vesicles.

This review focuses on the description of a number of classes of rationally designed phospholipase A2 inhibitors. The development of a theoretical framework for the proper analysis of inhibitors is presented. Structural studies of phospholipase A2‐inhibitor complexes suggest how the lipolysis reaction is catalyzed. Finally. some recent results on the use of phospholipase A2 inhibitors in living cells and tissues are revealed.— Gelb. M. H.. Jain. M. K..

The sPLA2 found in honey bee venom is neurotoxic and binds to this receptor with high affinity. In this paper. we have used a number of mutants of bee venom sPLA2 produced in Escherichia coli to determine the structural elements of this protein that are involved in its binding to N-type receptors. Mutations in the interfacial binding surface. in the Ca2+-binding loop and in the hydrophobic channel lead to a dramatic decrease in binding to N-type receptors. whereas mutations of surface residues localized in other parts of the sPLA2 structure do not significantly modify the binding properties.

Trypanosoma cruzi. by blocking ergosterol biosynthesis at the level of inhibition of lanosterol 14α-demethylase. Tipifarnib is an inhibitor of human protein farnesyltransferase. We synthesized tipifarnib analogues that no longer bind to protein farnesyltransferase and display increased potency for killing parasites. This was achieved in a structure-guided fashion by changing the substituents attached to the phenyl group at the 4-position of the quinoline ring of tipifarnib and by replacing the amino group by OMe. Several compounds that kill Trypanosoma cruzi at subnanomolar concentrations and are devoid of protein farnesyltransferase inhibition were discovered.

Previously we showed that blocking PFT in the malaria parasite led to cell death and that THQ-based inhibitors are the most potent among several structural classes of PFT inhibitors (PFTIs). We have prepared 266 THQ-based PFTIs and discovered several compounds that inhibit the malarial enzyme in the sub- to low-nanomolar range and that block the growth of the parasite (P. falciparum) in the low-nanomolar range.

A novel pre-steady-state kinetic analysis with enzyme tightly bound to vesicles and with a substrate that undergoes slow intervesicle exchange establishes that pPAF-AH accesses its substrate from the aqueous phase and thus is not an interfacial enzyme.

The objective of this study was to identify genes differentially expressed in EIB and to understand the function of these genes in the biology of asthma.  Methodology/Principal Findings Genome-wide expression profiling of airway leukocytes and epithelial cells obtained by induced sputum was conducted in two groups of subjects with asthma with and without EIB (n = 7 per group). at baseline and following exercise challenge. Based on the results of the gene expression study. additional comparisons were made with a normal control group (n = 10).

These proteins were used in a cell- and membrane-free. Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) activation system derived from Xenopus laevis eggs to examine the contribution of the farnesyl group toward the activation of the kinase. Whereas non-farnesylated H-Ras is unable to activate MAP kinase. farnesylation of H-Ras alone. in the absence of further processing. is sufficient to cause the activation of MAP kinase in this system.

This situation is due perhaps to a longstanding research emphasis on developmental regulation in sporulating strains of B. subtilis and the popularly held belief that Escherichia coli is the paradigm for prokaryotic gene expression. However. research during the past few years on tryptophan biosynthesis (10. 19. 20) and de novo purine nucleotide synthesis (7) and initial studies on other biosynthetic pathways have uncovered features that distinguish gene organization and regulation in species of Bacillus from those in the Gram-negative enteric bacteria.

Mutants bind tightly to anionic vesicles. and active-site substrate and Ca2+ binding are not impaired.

Since they can be released by virtually any cell lineages and are retrieved in biological fluids. microparticles appear as potent biomarkers.
