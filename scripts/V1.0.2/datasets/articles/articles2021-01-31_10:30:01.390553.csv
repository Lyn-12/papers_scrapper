56754,AMPK in health and disease,2009,Gregory R Steinberg and Bruce E Kemp,89,,3,1025-1078,American Physiological Society,The function and survival of all organisms is dependent on the dynamic control of energy metabolism. when energy demand is matched to energy supply. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) αβγ heterotrimer has emerged as an important integrator of signals that control energy balance through the regulation of multiple biochemical pathways in all eukaryotes. In this review. we begin with the discovery of the AMPK family and discuss the recent structural studies that have revealed the molecular basis for AMP binding to the enzyme's γ subunit. AMPK's regulation involves autoinhibitory features and phosphorylation of both the catalytic α subunit and the β-targeting subunit. We review the role of AMPK at the cellular level through examination of its many substrates and discuss how it controls cellular energy balance. We look at how AMPK integrates stress responses such as exercise as well as nutrient and …,True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,1526,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/physrev.00011.2008,1773194987387231241,/scholar?cites=1773194987387231241,,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00011.2008,0

The hypercalcemia results from the actions of tumor factors on bone and kidney. We report here the isolation of full-length complementary DNA clones of a putative hypercalcemia factor. and the expression from the cloned DNA of the active protein in mammalian cells. The clones encode a prepro peptide of 36 amino acids and a mature protein of 141 amino acids that has significant homology with parathyroid hormone in the amino-terminal region.

56756,Protein kinase C contains a pseudosubstrate prototope in its regulatory domain,1987,Colin House and Bruce E Kemp,238,Science,4834,1726-1728,American Association for the Advancement of Science,The regulatory domain of protein kinase C contains an amino acid sequence between residues 19 and 36 that resembles a substrate phosphorylation site in its distribution of basic residue recognition determinants. The corresponding synthetic peptide (Arg19-Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala25-Leu-Arg-Gln-Lys-Asn-Val-His -Glu-Val-Lys-Asn36) acts as a potent substrate antagonist with an inhibitory constant of 147 +/- 9 nM. It is a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C and inhibits both autophosphorylation and protein substrate phosphorylation. Substitution of Ala25 with serine transforms the pseudosubstrate into a potent substrate. These results demonstrate that the conserved region of the regulatory domain (residues 19 to 36) of protein kinase C has the secondary structural features of a pseudosubstrate and may be responsible for maintaining the enzyme in the inactive form in the absence of allosteric activators such as …,True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1157,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/238/4834/1726.abstract,10652189477482402064,/scholar?cites=10652189477482402064,,,0

In the present study. we assessed whether the agonist-induced (Ca2+-dependent. high-output) activation of eNOS is associated with changes in the phosphorylation of Thr495 in the calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain. eNOS Thr495 was constitutively phosphorylated in porcine aortic endothelial cells and was rapidly dephosphorylated after bradykinin stimulation. In the same cells. bradykinin enhanced the phosphorylation of Ser1177. which was maximal after 5 minutes. and abolished by the CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor KN-93.

A greater fall in plasma glucose from baseline occurred during rHDL than during placebo (at 4 hours rHDL 2.60. 4; placebo 2.10. 3mmol/L; P 0.018). rHDL increased plasma insulin (at 4 hours rHDL3. 410.0; placebo 19.27. 4 pmol/L; P 0.034) and also the homeostasis model assessment ß-cell function index (at 4 hours rHDL18. 95.9; placebo8. 64.4%; P 0.025).

While insulin is known to activate ACC in several cell types. accompanied by changes in ACC phosphorylation. the mechanism underlying this activation has been obscure. In the present study. we have examined. in Fao hepatoma cells. the effects of insulin on ACC and AMPK activity. the latter measured with a synthetic peptide corresponding to one of the phosphorylation sites on ACC for AMPK.

Recent discoveries demonstrate that AMPK is activated primarily by rising ADP levels and not. as previously thought. by AMP. AMPK activation is dependent on ADP-controlled phosphorylation of Thr172 on its activation loop. a mechanism of protein regulation that represents an example of an allosterically regulated modification (ARM). AMPK embodies many features of an adenylate charge regulatory system envisaged by Atkinson. where anabolic and catabolic pathway regulation is modulated by adenine nucleotide ratios.

A complementary DNA representing a portion of the smaller 50-kilodalton subunit of the rat brain enzyme has been cloned and sequenced. The calmodulin-binding region has been identified and a synthetic analog prepared that binds calmodulin with high affinity in the presence of calcium. Like the 50-kilodalton kinase polypeptide. the concentration of the messenger RNA varies both neuroanatomically and during postnatal development of the brain. The broad tissue and species cross-reactivity of the complementary DNA suggests that the 50-kilodalton subunit found in rat brain is evolutionarily conserved and is the product of a single gene.,True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,186,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/237/4812/293.abstract,1693839901485220866,/scholar?cites=1693839901485220866,,,0

Many protein kinases exist as catalytically inactive or latent forms unless activated by the binding of a ligand or by covalent modification. such as phosphorylation. The inactive form of protein kinases results from the presence of an autoinhibitory region that masks the catalytic activity.

Several lines of evidence show that these changes are driven largely by impaired tissue mitochondrial metabolism. While exercise is associated with numerous health benefits. there is no evidence that it affects skin tissue or that endocrine muscle‐to‐skin signaling occurs. We demonstrate that endurance exercise attenuates age‐associated changes to skin in humans and mice and identify exercise‐induced IL‐15 as a novel regulator of mitochondrial function in aging skin.

AMPK is activated in response to rises in intracellular AMP or calcium‐mediated signalling and is responsible for phosphorylating a wide variety of substrates. Recent structural studies have revealed the architecture of the αβγ subunit interactions as well as the AMP binding pockets on the γ subunit. The α catalytic domain (1–280) is autoinhibited by a C‐terminal tail (313–335). which is proposed to interact with the small lobe of the catalytic domain by homology modelling with the MARK2 protein structure.

The method. named Predikin. identifies key conserved substrate-determining residues in the kinase catalytic domain that contact the substrate in the region of the phosphorylation site and so determine the sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site. Predikin was implemented originally as a web application written in Javascript. Here. we describe a new version of Predikin. completely revised and rewritten as a modular framework that provides multiple enhancements compared with the original. Predikin now consists of two components: (i) PredikinDB. a database of phosphorylation sites that links substrates to kinase sequences and (ii) a Perl module. which provides methods to classify protein kinases. reliably identify substrate-determining residues. generate scoring matrices and score putative phosphorylation sites in query sequences. The performance of Predikin as measured using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) graph analysis equals or surpasses that of existing comparable methods. The Predikin website has been redesigned to incorporate the new features. New features in Predikin include the use of SQL queries to PredikinDB to generate predictions. scoring of predictions. more reliable identification of substrate-determining residues and putative phosphorylation sites. extended options to handle protein kinase and substrate data and an improved web interface. The new features significantly enhance the ability of Predikin to analyse protein kinases and their substrates.

Activation of AMPK provides beneficial outcomes in fighting against metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Currently. there is no allosteric AMPK activator available for the treatment of metabolic diseases. and limited compounds are available to robustly stimulate cellular/tissue AMPK in a specific manner. Here we investigated whether simultaneous administration of two different pharmacological AMPK activators. which bind and act on different sites. would result in an additive or synergistic effect on AMPK and its downstream signaling and physiological events in intact cells.

The energy-sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of endothelial cell lipid metabolism. To test the hypothesis that bradykinin (BK) regulates AMPK and fatty acid oxidation in endothelium. stimulations of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) with bradykinin were performed. BK stimulation caused a 2.3-fold increase in AMPK activity (p < 0.05). Activation of AMPK by BK in BAECs was inhibited by STO-609. an inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK). which is a known kinase upstream of AMPK. BK stimulation of BAECs also increased phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and this was inhibited by both STO-609 and over expression of an adenovirus encoded AMPK dominant negative (Ad-AMPK-DN).

Animal and retrospective human studies indicate that Metformin treatment is neuroprotective in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). although the neuroprotective mechanism is unknown. numerous studies suggest the beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis may be through AMPK activation. In this study we tested whether or not AMPK activation in dopamine neurons was required for the neuroprotective effects of Metformin in PD. We generated transgenic mice in which AMPK activity in dopamine neurons was ablated by removing AMPK beta 1 and beta 2 subunits from dopamine transporter expressing neurons. These AMPK WT and KO mice were then chronically exposed to Metformin in the drinking water then exposed to MPTP. the mouse model of PD. Chronic Metformin treatment significantly attenuated the MPTP-induced loss of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) neuronal number and volume and TH protein concentration in the nigrostriatal pathway. Additionally. Metformin treatment prevented the MPTP-induced elevation of the DOPAC:DA ratio regardless of genotype. Metformin also prevented MPTP induced gliosis in the Substantia Nigra.

We used recombinant S100A1 to further characterize the interaction between the two proteins. Zn2+ enhanced the binding of Ca2+/S100A1 to twitchin kinase fragments (Kd < 50 nM) in assays using a BIAcore biosensor by reducing the S100A1 off rate. Other Ca2+‐binding proteins (S100A6. calmodulin. and the calmodulin‐like domain of Ca2+‐dependent protein kinase α) bound to the kinase but did not activate it.

MA,Whereas Ca2+ serves as the primary intracellular messenger for regulation of contraction in all types of muscle. the underlying molecular mechanisms are different. Striated muscles utilize troponin C as the Ca2+ receptor and contain an array of cell specific proteins involved in maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis. Phosphorylation reactions are important in regulation of contraction but phosphorylation of myosin light chains does not play a major role in force generation (Sweeney and Stull. 1990). Smooth muscles utilize calmodulin as the Ca2+ receptor and phosphorylation of myosin light chains is the rate-limiting reaction in contractility (Kamm and Stull. 1985).

According to this model. smMLCK is autoinhibited in the absence of Ca2+/CaM due to the interaction of a pseudosubstrate prototope. contained within the CaM binding/regulatory region. with the active site of the enzyme. Binding of Ca2+/CaM releases the autoinhibition and allows access of the protein substrate to the active site of the enzyme. resulting in phosphorylation of the myosin light chains.

Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations occur principally by Ca2+ influx through plasma membrane Ca2+ channels or through release from internal storage compartments (Fig. 1). The binding of Ca2+ to a calmodulin. a modulator protein found in all eukaryotic cells. leads to a conformation capable of binding to an inactive myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). This binding results in isomerization of MLCK to an active form. which subsequently phosphorylates serine 19 of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC). For myosin from smooth and nonmuscle cells. RLC phosphorylation markedly increases actin-activated myosin MgATPase activity. Myosin RLC phosphorylation plays a central role in many cellular processes. including initiation of smooth muscle contraction (Kamm and Stull. 1985a; Hartshorne. 1987). platelet aggregation (Sellers and Adelstein. 1987). endothelial cell retraction (Sheldon et al.. 1993). exocytosis (Choi et al.. 1994). and lymphocyte receptor capping (Kerrick and Bourguignon. 1984). In skeletal and cardiac muscle. the actin-activated myosin MgATPase activity is maximal. even in the absence of RLC phosphorylation. However. RLC phosphorylation by a unique MLCK appears to move the cross-bridge away from the thick filament backbone. leading to potentiation of skeletal muscle contraction (Sweeney et al.. 1993).

AMPK inhibits fatty acid synthesis and promotes fatty acid oxidation by phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1 at Ser79 and ACC2 at Ser212. Using mice with Ser79Ala/Ser212Ala knock-in mutations (ACC DKI) we find that inhibition of ACC phosphorylation leads to reduced appetite in response to fasting or cold exposure. At sub-thermoneutral temperatures. ACC DKI mice maintain normal energy expenditure and thermogenesis. but fail to increase appetite and lose weight. We demonstrate that the ACC DKI phenotype can be mimicked in wild type mice using a ghrelin receptor antagonist and that ACC DKI mice have impaired orexigenic responses to ghrelin. indicating ACC DKI mice have a ghrelin signaling defect.

Results Basal expression of activated AMPK. phosphorylayed at αThr172. was markedly reduced by 96% in AMPK-β1−/− mice. Acute renal ischaemia caused a 3.2-fold increase in α1-AMPK activity and a 2.5-fold increase in α2-AMPK activity (P<0.001) that was associated with an increase in AMPK phosphorylation of the AMPK-α subunit at Thr172 and Ser485. and increased inhibitory phosphorylation of the AMPK substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase.

Here. we investigated the protective effects in a 3-day unilateral ureteral obstruction (3dUUO) mouse model. Compared with controls. ureteral obstructed animals displayed increased tubular damage and inflammation. Metformin treatment attenuated inflammation. increased the anti-oxidative response and decreased tubular damage.

Km's are increased appreciably with analogues in which the N-terminal cluster of basic residues is reduced or where alanine is substituted for Arg238. Even more dramatic effects are elicited by alanine substitution of one of the adjacent serine residues. resulting in 20-fold to 800-fold increases in the Km's for the [Ala235] and [Ala236] S6 (229-239) variants. respectively.

In this study we show the energy-sensing kinase AMPK inhibits NKCC1 activity. Three separate AMPK activators (AICAR. Phenformin and A-769662) inhibited NKCC1 flux in a variety of nucleated cells. Treatment with A-769662 resulted in a reduction of NKCC1T212/T217 phosphorylation. and this was reversed by treatment with the non-selective AMPK inhibitor Compound C. AMPK dependence was confirmed by treatment of AMPK null mouse embryonic fibroblasts. where A-769662 had no effect on NKCC1 mediated transport.

The kinase mediates most. if not all. of the cellular functions of cAMP. Physiologically. the series of events leading to cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation begins with the binding of a hormone or other agent to a cell surface receptor. In many cases. the binding leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase and a consequential increase in the intracellular level of cAMP. In eukaryotes. the major. if not sole. cellular receptor of cAMP is the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The kinase is activated upon binding of cAMP to its regulatory subunits.

However. its underlying mechanism of action is not completely understood. In this study. we have shown that a level of metrnl increase in vitro under electrical-pulse-stimulation (EPS) and in vivo in exercise mice. suggesting that metrnl is an exercise-induced myokine. In addition. metrnl increases glucose uptake through the calcium-dependent AMPK pathway. Metrnl also increases the phosphorylation of HDAC5. a transcriptional repressor of GLUT4. in an AMPK-dependent manner. Phosphorylated HDAC5 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins and sequesters them in the cytoplasm. resulting in the activation of GLUT4 transcription. The intraperitoneal injection of recombinant metrnl improves glucose tolerance in mice with high fat-induced obesity or type 2 diabetes (db/db). but this is not seen in AMPK β1β2 muscle-specific null mice (AMPK β1β2 MKO).

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of cellular energetics and plays essential roles regulating macrophage lipid dynamics. Here. we investigated the consequences of atherogenic lipoprotein-induced foam cell formation on downstream immunometabolic signaling in primary mouse macrophages. A variety of atherogenic low-density lipoproteins (acetylated. oxidized. and aggregated forms) activated AMPK signaling in a manner that was in part due to CD36 and calcium-related signaling. In quiescent macrophages. basal AMPK signaling was crucial for maintaining markers of lysosomal homeostasis as well as levels of key components in the lysosomal expression and regulation network. Moreover. AMPK activation resulted in targeted upregulation of members of this network via transcription factor EB. However. in lipid-induced macrophage foam cells. neither basal AMPK signaling nor its activation affected lysosomal-associated programs.

The spectrum of liver pathology in NAFLD ranges from steatosis to more serious disorders. such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. fibrosis and chirrosis with increased risk of liver failure and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore. NAFLD is an important risk factor for chronic diseases. such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.Despite the prevalence and seriousness of complications. the only currently accepted treatment for NAFLD are lifestyle changes leading to weight reduction. However. these benefits are often mitigated by high attrition rates and weight gain rebound highlighting the need for novel pharmaceutical strategies to improve NAFLD. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy-sensing enzyme that is activated in response to energy stress. Once activated. AMPK promotes ATP-generating catabolic pathways and inhibits ATP-consuming anabolic pathways to restore energy balance. AMPK effects on lipid metabolism include the reduction of intracellular lipid levels through inhibition of de novo lipogenesis and promotion of fatty acid oxidation. AMPK activity is reduced in obesity and type 2 diabetes. the most common conditions associated with NAFLD. AMPK activation has therefore been proposed as an attractive strategy for the improvement of hepatic steatosis.

N-terminal myristoylation of the ?-subunit has been shown to suppress Thr172 phosphorylation. keeping AMPK in an inactive state. Here we use amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to investigate the structural and dynamic properties of the mammalian myristoylated and non-myristoylated inactivated AMPK (D139A) in the presence and absence of nucleotides. HDX MS data suggests that the myristoyl group binds near the first helix of the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain similar to other kinases. Our data. however. also shows that ATP.Mg2+ results in a global stabilization of myristoylated. but not non-myristoylated AMPK. and most notably for peptides of the activation loop of the ?-kinase domain. the autoinhibitory sequence (AIS) and the ?CBM. AMP does not have that effect and HDX measurements for myristoylated and non-myristoylated AMPK in the presence of AMP are similar. These differences in dynamics may account for a reduced basal rate of phosphorylation of Thr172 in myristoylated AMPK in skeletal muscle where endogenous ATP concentrations are very high. © The Author(s) 2016.,True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:wBLCggQE-ToC,0,https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/173974,,,,,0

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA. 87: 2284–2288. 1990). The calculated Mr is 107.534 whereas the estimate by SDS-PAGE is approximately 130.000. Gibson and Higgins (DNA Sequence (in press)) have recently reported the possibility of errors in the cDNA sequence for non-muscle MLCK and that the NH2-terminus of both it and smMLCK may extend beyond the reported coding region. The native smMLCK is NH2-terminally blocked. A CNBr peptide derived from smMLCK contains the NH2-terminal sequence Asp-Phe-Arg-Ala corresponding to residues 2 to 4 in the smMLCK sequence indicating that Met-1 is present. Using a limited thermolysin digest we isolated an NH.-terminally blocked peptide by reversed-phase HPLC. This thermolytic peptide had a mass of approximately 797 by time of flight mass spectrometry. Amino acid analysis and Edman sequencing of a CNBr-subfragment of the thermolytic peptide indicated that it had the composition and sequence.(Met)-Asp-Phe-Arg-Ala-Asn. with a calculated mass of 753. The difference in mass corresponds to the NH2-terminal Met being blocked by acetylation. The results demonstrate that the NH2-terminal sequence of smMLCK inferred from the reported cDNA sequence is correct and that the proposed initiating Met is not removed. but modified by O-NH2 acetylation of the translation product.(Mol Cell Biochem 127/128: 81–91. 1993),True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:1r-w4gtu6w8C,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BCroBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA81&dq=info:AWcRTKP9lNoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=UaIB3m7BKY&sig=_5F3Mt4tsauzyP7q9G4zvMkW46Q,,,,,0

Substrates of PKA appear to be involved with a wider range of biological processes than those of PKG. and some processes. such as nucleic acid metabolism. are more prevalent in PKG substrates. Protein crystal structures have revealed that protein kinases have extended grooves to accommodate the protein substrate sequence around the target phosphorylation site. Residues in the substrate sequence make contact with amino acid residues in the protein kinase substrate binding groove termed substrate-determining residues (SDRs). and so determine which substrates are preferred to bind to …,True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123741455001820,,,,,0

Their importance is further reflected in the fact that phosphorylation is the most abundant type of cellular regulation. affecting essentially every cellular process. including metabolism. growth. differentiation. motility. membrane transport. learning. and memory. Protein kinase can be regulated in diverse ways. ranging from transcriptional control through subcellular localization and recruitment of substrates. to structural and chemical modifications of the proteins themselves. The specificity in the cell is determined by a combination of “peptide specificity” of the kinase. substrate recruitment. and phosphatase activity.

Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) reverses obesity by promoting the preferential loss of white adipose tissue. We evaluated the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CNTF regulates adiposity. Obese mice fed a high fat diet were treated with saline (HFD) or recombinant CNTF for 10 days and adipose tissue was removed for analysis. Another group fed a HFD were pair fed (PF) to CNTF mice. In separate experiments 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with CNTF to examine metabolic responses and signaling. CNTF reduced adipose mass that resulted from reductions in adipocyte area and triglyceride content. CNTF treatment did not affect lipolysis but resulted in decreases in fat esterification and lipogenesis and enhanced fatty acid oxidation. The enhanced fat oxidation was associated with the expression of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor coactivator1α (PGC1α) and nuclear respiratory factor 1. increases in oxidative phosphorylation subunits and mitochondrial biogenesis as determined by electron microscopy. Studies in cultured adipocytes revealed that CNTF activates p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK). Inhibiting p38 activation prevented the CNTF-induced increase in PGC1α but not AMPK activation. Diminished food intake with PF induced similar decreases in fat mass but this was related to increased expression of uncoupling protein 1.

57292,BRADYKININ STIMULATED ACTIVATION OF AMPK IN ENDOTHELIAL CELLS: A NEW PATHWAY TO REVERSE ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION? 1510,2006,P MOUNT and S Venkatesan and N Lane and F Katsis and B KEMP and D POWER,11,Nephrology,,,,Endothelial dysfunction. the precursor of vascular disease. is associated with lipid accumulation within endothelial cells. The energy-sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates endothelial cell lipid metabolism by phosphorylating and inhibiting both HMGCoA reductase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC); rate limiting enzymes of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis respectively. Bradykinin (BK). the effector molecule of the kinin-kallikrein system. has multiple beneficial effects on endothelial cell function. To determine whether BK regulates AMPK in endothelium. stimulations of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) with BK were performed. BK (10-6 M) caused a marked increase in AMPK activity. which occurred within 30 secs and persisted for 30 mins (p< 0.05). Activation of AMPK by BK was observed with low BK concentrations (10-10 M. p< 0.05). consistent with this being in the physiological range.

57328,CELL AND MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY-Inhibition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator by novel interaction with the metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase,2000,Kenneth R Hallows and Viswanathan Raghuram and Bruce E Kemp and Lee A Witters and J Kevin Foskett,105,Journal of Clinical Investigation,12,1711-1722,[New York. etc.] American Society for Clinical Investigation.,The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-gated Cl- channel that regulates other epithelial transport proteins by uncharacterized mechanisms. We employed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the COOH-terminal 70 residues of CFTR to identify proteins that might be involved in such interactions. The alpha1 (catalytic) subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was identified as a dominant and novel interacting protein. The interaction is mediated by residues 1420-1457 in CFTR and by the COOH-terminal regulatory domain of alpha1-AMPK. Mutations of two protein trafficking motifs within the 38-amino acid region in CFTR each disrupted the interaction. GST-fusion protein pull-down assays in vitro and in transfected cells confirmed the CFTR-alpha1-AMPK interaction and also identified alpha2-AMPK as an interactor with CFTR.

NJ,The reversible phosphorylation of proteins by protein kinases is the most extensively used molecular mechanism regulating cellular functions in eukaryotes. Essentially all major cellular processes. including cell growth and differentiation. motility. metabolism. and communication between cells. are in some way regulated by protein phosphorylation (Fig. 1). It is estimated that approx 30% of all mammalian proteins exist in different phosphorylated forms. To finetune the cellular response to external or internal signals toward such a diversity of substrates. protein kinases themselves must be tightly regulated and be present in a sufficiently large number of diverse forms. It is therefore not surprising that the recent genome sequencing projects revealed that a large proportion of genes code for different protein kinase catalytic subunits.

With the recent explosive growth in the use of mass spectrometry in the structural analysis of proteins and peptides. this approach has also become the method of choice for the elucidation of post-translational modifications. including phosphorylation. Many developments have taken place since early studies using fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) in 1985 (1). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDITOF). electrospray ionization (ESI) triple quadrupole mass spectrometry and its low flow rate version. nano-ESI mass spectrometry. are currently the most widely used forms of instrumentation in these studies. They are both sensitive and highly precise. and this chapter will be confined to these instrumentation types. with which we have practical experience. Hybrid instruments eg Q-TOF (quadrupole time-of-flight) are now available. or in advanced stages of development. from several manufacturers. as well as both electrospray and MALDITOF instruments with Fourier transform detection at the frontiers of precision. Other mass spectrometric analytical methodologies. including ion-trap methods. have been applied to phosphorylation site analysis.

We have determined that PTHrP localizes to the nucleus at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and is transported to the cytoplasm when cells divide. PTHrP contains a putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (residues 61-94) similar to that of SV40 T-antigen. which may be implicated in the nuclear import of the molecule. We identified that Thr85 immediately prior to the NLS of PTHrP was phosphorylated by CDC2-CDK2 and phosphorylation was cell cycle-dependent.

57342,The specific cGMP-dependent protein kinase substrate stop protein. is phosphorylated in nerve terminals,1998,X Wang and PJ Robinson and K Mitchlhill and BE Kemp,9,Proceedings of the Australian Neuroscience Society,,88,,[en] Full text: cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) plays a key role to transducing cGMP action such as neurotransmission. learning and memory and neuronal differentiation. PKG achieves its function by phosphorylating its substrates. Despite its apparent importance. however. remarkably few specific PKG substrates in nerve terminals have been identified. We have demonstrated that there are more than 10 specific PKG substrates in nerve terminals (synaptosomes) of rat brain. Among them. we purified a 130 kDa (P130) protein and identified it as STOP (stable tubule-only polypeptide) protein by protein micro-sequencing. STOP binds to cold stable microtubules and prevents them from disassembly. STOP was phosphorylated by PKG on a serine residue in vitro but not by cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C. The phosphorylation of STOP by PKG only occurred at lower Mg 2+ concentration (1 mM) and not at 3 or 10 mM. STOP was also phosphorylated in living nerve terminals. as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. from 32 Pi-labeled synaptosomes using a synthetic peptide antibody we raised against rat brain STOP. The 32 Pi-labeled STOP from synaptosomes comigrated on SDS gels with purified STOP phosphorylated by PKG in vitro. Studies of the possible effect of cGMP analogues or nitric oxide donor on STOP phosphorylation and neurotransmission are underway. STOP represents the third identified nerve terminal PKG substrates (after G-substrate and DARPP-32) and hence may impact on our understanding of the role of cGMP signalling in neuronal function.

There are multiple genes for each subunit and the rat liver AMPK 1 and 2 catalytic subunits are associated with 1 and 1 noncatalytic subunits. We find that the isolated 1 subunit is N-terminally acetylated with no other posttranslational modification. The isolated 1 subunit is N-terminally myristoylated. Transfection of COS cells with AMPK subunit cDNAs containing a nonmyristoylatable 1 reduces. but does not eliminate. membrane binding of AMPK heterotrimer. The isolated1 subunit is partially phosphorylated at three sites. Ser24/25. Ser182. and Ser108. The Ser24/25 and Ser108 sites are substoichiometrically phosphorylated and can be autophosphorylated in vitro. The Ser-Pro site in the sequence LSSS182PPGP is stoichiometrically phosphorylated. and no additional phosphate is incorporated into this site with autophosphorylation. Based on labeling studies in transfected cells. we conclude that 1 Thr172 is a major. although not exclusive. site of both basal and stimulated 1 phosphorylation by an upstream AMPK kinase.The 5-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 1 isolated from liver consists of three subunits. the catalytic subunit (548 residues. Mr 62.497 63 kDa) and two noncatalytic subunits.(Mr 30.378 40 kDa) and(Mr 37.429 38 kDa)(1–3).

In addition. unregulated cAPK expression in vivo blocks ADH2 depression in an ADR1-dependent fashion in which ADR1c mutations display decreased sensitivity to unregulated cAPK activity. Taken together. these data have suggested that ADR1c mutations enhance ADR1 activity by blocking cAPK phosphorylation and inactivation of Ser-230. We have isolated and characterized an additional 17 ADR1c mutations. defining 10 different amino acid changes. that were located in the region defined by amino acids 227 through 239 of ADR1. Three observations. however. indicate that the ADR1c phenotype is not simply equivalent to a lack of cAPK phosphorylation. First. only some of these newly isolated ADR1c mutations affected the ability of yeast cAPK to phosphorylate corresponding synthetic peptides modeled on the 222 to 234 region of ADR1 in vitro. Second. we observed that strains lacking cAPK activity did not display enhanced ADH2 expression under glucose growth conditions. Third. when Ser-230 was mutated to a nonphosphorylatable residue. lack of cAPK activity led to a substantial increase in ADH2 expression under glucose-repressed conditions. Thus. while cAPK controls ADH2 expression and ADR1 is required for this control. cAPK acts by a mechanism that is independent of effects on …,True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:FsLZdJ3BAzkC,0,https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/pmc369592,,,,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc369592?pdf=render,0

57389,Histone 4 Phosphotransferase Activities in Proliferating Lymphocytes,,RUTHANN A MASARACCHIA and BRUCE E KEMP and DONAL A WALSH,,,,,,Two histone H4 phosphotransferase activities are observed in DE52 chromatography or sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of murine lymphosarcoma cell extracts. One of these enzymes (H4-Kinase-(I)) has been purified several thousandfold by ion exchange and Sephadex G-200 chromatography. H4 was the only phosphorylated product detected when an equimolar mixture of histones Hl. H2A. H2B. H3. and H4 was incubated with H4-Kinase-(I) and [+* PlATP. The phosphorylation rates of H2A. H2B. Hl. or H3 was~ 20% of that observed with H4. The apparent K... values for ATP and H4 were 69 and 16 PM. respectively. The molecular weight of H4-Kinase-(I). as estimated by gel filtration. is 102.000. consistent with an s~~.~ of 5.2 obtained from sucrose gradient centrifugation. H4-Kinase-(I) catalyzed the formation of 1.02 mol of phosphoserinelmol of H4. Peptides corresponding to the two amino acid sequences containing serine in H4 have been synthesized. The peptide Ac-Ser-Gly-Arg-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly (residues 1 to 7) was not a substrate for H4-Kinase-(I) when tested at concentration of up to 1 mu. In contrast. the second peptide containing residues 43 to 49 with an added COOH-terminal glycine (ie Val-Lys-Arg-lle-Ser-Gly-Leu-Gly) was phosphorylated with an apparent K. of 35 pm. It is concluded that H4-Kinase-(1) specifically phosphorylates Ser-47 in Histone H4. The second H4-phosphotransferase(H4-Kinase-(II)) was partially purified by ion exchange chromatography and ammonium sulfate precipitation. H4-Kinase-(II) phosphorylated the H4 peptide containing Ser-1 (residues 1 to 7) but not the H4 peptide containing Ser-47 (residues 43 to …,True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:17ZO-CJnx_8C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bruce_Kemp/publication/22939322_Histone_4_phosphotransferase_activities_in_proliferating_lymphocytes_Partial_purification_and_characterization_of_an_enzyme_specific_for_Ser-47/links/5cb6d69f92851c8d22f0c4fe/Histone-4-phosphotransferase-activities-in-proliferating-lymphocytes-Partial-purification-and-characterization-of-an-enzyme-specific-for-Ser-47.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bruce_Kemp/publication/22939322_Histone_4_phosphotransferase_activities_in_proliferating_lymphocytes_Partial_purification_and_characterization_of_an_enzyme_specific_for_Ser-47/links/5cb6d69f92851c8d22f0c4fe/Histone-4-phosphotransferase-activities-in-proliferating-lymphocytes-Partial-purification-and-characterization-of-an-enzyme-specific-for-Ser-47.pdf,0

57392,Germline deletion of AMP-activated protein kinase subunits reduces bone mass without altering osteoclast differentiation or function,,Julian MW Quinn and Shanna Tam and Natalie A Sims and Hasnawati Saleh and Narelle E McGregor and Ingrid J Poulton and John W Scott and Matthew T Gillespie and Bruce E Kemp and BJW van Denderen,,,,,,Since AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays important roles in modulating metabolism in response to diet and exercise. both of which influence bone mass. we examined the influence of AMPK on bone mass in mice. AMPK is an heterotrimer where the subunit anchors the catalytic and regulatory subunits. Germline deletion of either AMPK 1 or 2 subunit isoforms resulted in reduced trabecular bone density and mass. but without effects on osteoclast (OC) or osteoblast (OB) numbers. as compared to wild-type littermate controls. We tested whether activating AMPK in vivo would enhance bone density but found AICA-riboside treatment caused a profound loss of trabecular bone volume (49.5%) and density and associated increased OC numbers. Consistent with this. AICA-riboside strongly stimulated OC differentiation in vitro. in an adenosine kinase-dependent manner. OCs and macrophages (unlike OBs) lacked AMPK 2 subunit expression. and when generated from AMPK 1/ mice displayed no detectable AMPK activity. Nevertheless. AICA-riboside was equally effective at stimulating OC differentiation from wildtype or 1/ progenitors. indicating that AMPK is not essential for OC differentiation or the stimulatory action of AICA-riboside.

57398,Regulation Of Transcription And Regulatory Networks For Muscle Growth,,A Reverter,,,,,,The advent of microarray gene expression technology has provided animal scientists with an unprecedented ability to profile the transcriptional changes during skeletal muscle growth. With respect to meat quality. most of the effort has concentrated on the understanding of fat and energy metabolism (reviewed by Hausman et al.(2009)). Graugnard et al.(2009) explored the network among 31 genes associated with aspects of adipogenesis and energy metabolism in bovine skeletal muscle and in response to two distinct diets. Also. Freyssenet (2007) reviewed the roles that energy-sensing molecules and mitochondria have in the regulation of gene expression in muscle. However. other mechanisms such as cell cycle. glycolysis. extra-cellular matrix. ribosomal proteins and the immune system play a significant role in development. and this role can work in a tissue-specific manner.Hudson et al.(2009a) reported various functional modules underpinning the transcriptional regulation of bovine skeletal muscle. The authors integrated a total of six gene co-expression networks. each developed using the PCIT algorithm (Reverter and Chan (2008)). and proposed a Module-to-Regulator heuristic by which those transcription factors (TF) with the highest average absolute correlation co-expression with the genes present in each module are deemed to be the relevant regulators. However. this Module-to-Regulator approach failed to capture some well-known regulators of muscle fibre type composition. and the use of more sophisticated methods such as the differential wiring approach of Hudson et al.(2009b) or the Regulatory Impact Factor (RIF) metrics of …,True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:wKETBy42zhYC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/42113356/Regulation_of_transcription_and_regulato20160204-3411-ye8zs.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42113356/Regulation_of_transcription_and_regulato20160204-3411-ye8zs.pdf,0

It has also been demonstrated that myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2) binding activity is necessary for regulation of the GLUT-4 gene in skeletal muscle (Thai et al.. 1998). In the basal state. MEF-2 is believed to be inhibited by the class II histone deacetylases (HDACs). an association that is broken by phosphorylation of HDACs and their subsequent nuclear export. Association of MEF-2 with coactivators possessing histone acetylase (HAT) activity is thought to be mediated by the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) pathway. Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT. resulting in its nuclear translocation where it recruits co-activators possessing HAT activity to MEF-2 allowing maximal MEF-2 DNA binding.

This method utilizes 4 N methanesulfonic acid containing 0.2% 3-(2-aminoethyl)indole. rather then 6N HCl as a catalyst for hydrolysis. The hydrolysis is carried out in vacuo (20 mu) at 115 degrees for 22 to 72 hours. Half-cystine is determined as S-sulfocysteine by treating the hydrolysate with dithiothreitol followed by an excess of tetrathionate. The values of all amino acids. including tryptophan and half-cystine. were close to the expected theoretical values for the proteins examined. The method has the advantage that the neutralized hydrolysate can be applied directly to an ion exchange column.

Recent studies have shown that exosomes are also found in vivo in body fluids such as blood. urine. amniotic fluid. malignant ascites. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. synovial fluid. and breast milk. While the biological function of exosomes is still unclear. they can mediate communication between cells. facilitating processes such as antigen presentation and in trans signaling to neighboring cells. Exosome‐like vesicles identified in Drosophila (referred to as argosomes) may be potential vehicles for the spread of morphogens in epithelia.

Overexpression of IL‐6 has been implicated in the pathology of a number of diseases including multiple myeloma. rheumatoid arthritis. Castleman's disease. psoriasis. and post‐menopausal osteoporosis. Hence. selective antagonists of IL‐6 action may offer therapeutic benefits. IL‐6 is a member of the family of cytokines that includes interleukin‐11. leukemia inhibitory factor. oncostatin M. cardiotrophin‐1. and ciliary neurotrophic factor. Like the other members of this family. IL‐6 induces growth or differentiation via a receptor‐system that involves a specific receptor and the use of a shared signaling subunit. gp130.

Most exported proteins require a conserved motif (RxLxE/Q/D). termed the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL) or vacuolar targeting sequence (VTS). for targeting beyond the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and into the host cell; however. the precise role of this motif in export is poorly defined. We used transgenic P. falciparum expressing chimeric proteins to investigate the function of the PEXEL motif for export. The PEXEL constitutes a bifunctional export motif comprising a protease recognition sequence that is cleaved. in the endoplasmic reticulum. from proteins destined for export. in a PEXEL arginine‐ and leucine‐dependent manner. Following processing. the remaining conserved PEXEL residue is required to direct the mature protein to the host cell …,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC,172,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00864.x,16486897186352600967,/scholar?cites=16486897186352600967,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00864.x,0

In addition. our findings were compared with two previous reviews covering cases from 1971 to 2004.

We now describe the molecular cloning of cDNA corresponding to murine p160. The P160 gene is located on mouse chromosome 11. and related sequences are found on chromosomes 1 and 12. The predicted p160 protein is novel. and in agreement with previous studies. we find that the corresponding 4.5-kb mRNA is ubiquitously expressed.

Albumin has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) since it can bind to and transport amyloid beta (Aβ). the causative agent of AD; albumin is also a potent inhibitor of Aβ polymerization. Despite evidence of non-hepatic transcription of albumin in many tissues including kidney and pancreas. non-hepatic synthesis of albumin at the protein level has been rarely confirmed. In a pilot phase study of Human Brain Proteome Project. we found evidence that microglial cells in brain may synthesize albumin. Here we report. for the first time. the de novo synthesis of albumin in human microglial cells in brain. Furtherore. we demonstrate that the synthesis and secretion of albumin from microglial cells is enhanced upon microgial activation by Aβ1–42- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treatment.

Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a key mediator of many oxidative stress responses. involving GAPDH nuclear translocation and induction of cell death. We report here that GAPDH interacts with the telomerase RNA component (TERC). inhibits telomerase activity. and induces telomere shortening and breast cancer cell senescence.

Amino acid sequences of four peptides obtained after isolation of the protein on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels were completely homologous to sequences occurring within subunit E of barley vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase. Nucleotide sequence data of cloned cDNAs from both Yd2 and non-Yd2 barley varieties showed an amino acid change arising from a single-base-pair polymorphism. This was predicted to result in the shift in isoelectric point used previously to differentiate the protein in Yd2 and non-Yd2 barleys.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent an integral facet of intercellular communication largely through the transfer of functional cargo such as proteins. messenger RNAs (mRNAs). microRNA (miRNAs). DNAs and lipids. EVs. especially exosomes and shed microvesicles. represent an important delivery medium in the tumour micro-environment through the reciprocal dissemination of signals between cancer and resident stromal cells to facilitate tumorigenesis and metastasis. An important step of the metastatic cascade is the reprogramming of cancer cells from an epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype (epithelial–mesenchymal transition.

LLC,Podoplanin (PDPN) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays crucial roles in embryonic development. the immune response. and malignant progression. Here. we report that cells ectopically or endogenously expressing PDPN release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain PDPN mRNA and protein. PDPN incorporates into membrane shed microvesicles (MVs) and endosomal-derived exosomes (EXOs). where it was found to colocalize with the canonical EV marker CD63 by immunoelectron microscopy.

57603,Contribution of cells undergoing epithelial–mesenchymal transition to the tumour microenvironment,2013,Rommel A Mathias and Shashi K Gopal and Richard J Simpson,78,,,545-557,Elsevier,Human cancer mortality is predominantly determined by the spread of tumour cells from a primary to secondary anatomical location. The metastatic cascade follows tumour cell dissemination. passage through the blood and/or lymphatic system. and colonisation at a distant site. Increased cell motility of cancer cells at the leading tumour edge has been attributed to the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) which facilitates their release and invasiveness. Mechanisms behind cancer cell dissemination and homing of metastatic cells to a secondary site remain largely unknown. However. certain cancers have a propensity to metastasise to particular organs. and one possible explanation is the seed and soil hypothesis. which is predicated on circulating tumour cells settling in favourable conditions.

It binds ferrotransferrin from serum and endocytoses it into an acidic nonlysosomal intracellular compartment where iron is released. but in which apotransferrin remains tightly bound to its receptor. Recycling of the apotransferrin-receptor complex to the cell surface is associated with a return to neutral pH and concomitant loss of affinity of apotransferrin for its receptor. Apotransferrin is then free to leave the cell and initiate a new cycle. We have exploited this cycle in a novel method for the purification of the receptor for transferrin.

AChE purified from eel or foetal bovine serum possesses proteolytic activity in addition to esterase activity. The presence of trypsin-like and metallocarboxypeptidase-like activities associated with AChE accounts for its ability to convert enkephalin peptide precursors into enkephalins. Several lines of evidence indicate that AChE's trypsin-like activity is an integral component of the molecule and that it is activated by autolysis. Incubation of affinity-purified eel AChE generated several fragments of low relative molecular mass (Mr). One of these low Mr fragments (Mr = 25.000 Da. 25K) cleaved from the 70K form of AChE. possessed considerable sequence similarity to the N-terminal sequence of pancreatic trypsin.

57662,The major colonic cell mitogen extractable from colonic mucosa is an N terminally extended form of basic fibroblast growth factor,1991,Edouard C Nice and Louis Fabri and Robert H Whitehead and Robert James and Richard J Simpson and Antony W Burgess,266,Journal of Biological Chemistry,22,14425-14430,Elsevier,Colonic growth factors (CGFs) were extracted from porcine intestinal epithelium and mucosa. Under acidic conditions. very little mitogenic activity (as assayed using murine 3T3 fibroblasts and a human colonic cell line) was extractable. However. by extracting at neutral or slightly alkaline pH. significant mitogenic activity for both the murine fibroblasts and human colonic carcinoma cell line could be detected. CGFs are present throughout the intestine and cecum. The epithelial mucosa of the distal colorectal region appeared to contain mitogens which were more potent for the colonic cells than the 3T3 fibroblasts. Purification of CGFs from the colonic mucosa required removal of associated mucin by pH precipitation prior to chromatographic fractionation. It was then possible to develop a complete purification (390.000-fold) scheme for the major CGF. an 18-kDa protein which bound to heparin-Sepharose.

This study aims to identify miRNA profiles of shed microvesicles (sMVs) and exosomes (Exos) secreted from the isogenic colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines SW480 and SW620 and evaluate their ability to predict CRC. Deep sequencing of miRNAs in parental cell lysates (CLs) and highly-purified sMVs and Exos was performed. We focused on miRNAs enriched in EVs and dysregulated miRNAs in metastatic cells (SW620) relative to primary cancer cells (SW480). We investigated the ability of EV miRNA signatures to predict CRC tumours using 594 tumours (representing different pathological stages) and 11 normal samples obtained from TCGA. In SW480 and SW620 cells we identified 345 miRNAs. of which 61 and 73 were upregulated and downregulated in SW620-CLs compared to SW480-CLs. respectively. Selective distribution of cellular miRNAs into EVs results in distinct miRNA signatures for sMVs and Exos in each cell line. Cross cell line comparisons of EV miRNA profiles reveal a subset of miRNAs critical in CRC progression from primary carcinoma to metastasis. Many miRNAs non-detectable (<5 TPM) in CLs were significantly enriched (>1000 TPM) in secreted EVs. Strikingly. miR-7641 which is non-detectable in SW480-CL but upregulated in SW620-CL is highly enriched in EVs secreted from both cell lines. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that EV miRNA profiles can be used to predict CRC tumours with ~96% accuracy.

The growth stimulatory activity of pMC5 on the mouse hybridoma cell line 7TD1 was <0.05% of mIL‐6. whereas pMC5H and mIL‐6 were equipotent.

HIV-1 binding and fusion with the DC membrane results in low level de novo infection that can also be transferred to T lymphocytes at a later stage. We have previously reported that HIV-1 can induce partial maturation of iMDDCs at both stages of trafficking. Here we show that CD45+ microvesicles (MV) which contaminate purified HIV-1 inocula due to similar size and density. affect DC maturation. de novo HIV-1 infection and transfer to T lymphocytes. Comparing iMDDCs infected with CD45-depleted HIV-1BaL or matched non-depleted preparations. the presence of CD45+ MVs was shown to enhance DC maturation and ICAM-1 (CD54) expression. which is involved in DC∶T lymphocyte interactions. while restricting HIV-1 infection of MDDCs. Furthermore. in the DC culture HIV-1 infected (p24+) MDDCs were more mature than bystander cells. Depletion of MVs from the HIV-1 inoculum markedly inhibited DC∶T lymphocyte clustering and the induction of alloproliferation as well as limiting HIV-1 transfer from DCs to T lymphocytes.

Biosensor technology is ideally suited for examining in real time the role of phosphorylation on protein–protein interactions in signaling pathways. We have developed processes for on-chip phosphorylation of immobilized receptors on biosensor surfaces. These processes have been used to analyze E-cadherin/β-catenin interactions. Phosphorylation of the intracellular domain (ICD) of E-cadherin modulates its affinity to β-catenin and consequently the strength of cell–cell adhesion.

Disulfide-bonded peptides were identified by altered mobility on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography in the presence or absence of dithiothreitol and subjected to amino acid sequencing. Peptides containing more than one disulfide bond were subjected to further proteolysis and disulfide-bonded subfragments identified and sequenced. The three disulfide bonds are CYS13-CYS135. CYS19-CYS132 and CYS61-164 and the first and third of these are clearly homologous to the two disulfide bonds in oncostatin M. The spatial organization of the cysteine residues in the predicted four α-helical bundle structure of LIF (Bazan.

The human urinary proteome can reflect the status of the microenvironment of the urinary system and is an ideal source for clinical diagnosis of urinary system diseases. Our previous work used proteomics to identify 1643 high-confidence urinary proteins in the urine from a healthy population. Here. we used bioinformatics to construct a cancer-associated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network comprising 16 high-abundance urinary proteins based on the urinary proteome database. As a result. platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) was selected for further validation as a candidate biomarker for NMIBC diagnosis and prognosis. Although the levels of urinary PDGFRB showed no significant difference between patients pre- and post-surgery (n = 185. P>0.05). over 3 years of follow-up. urinary PDGFRB was shown to be significantly higher in relapsed patients (n = 68) than in relapse-free patients (n = 117. P<0.001). The levels of urinary PDGFRB were significantly correlated with the risk of 3-year recurrence of NMIBC. and these levels improved the accuracy of a NMIBC recurrence risk prediction model that included age. tumor size. and tumor number (area under the curve. 0.862; 95% CI. 0.809 to 0.914) compared to PDGFR alone.

Despite of accumulating evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction underlies the pathogenesis of TDP-43–related ALS. the roles of wild-type TDP-43 in mitochondria are unknown. Here. we show that the small TDP-43 population present in mitochondria binds directly to a subset of mitochondrial tRNAs and precursor RNA encoded in L-strand mtDNA.

57722,Genomics and proteomics in stem cell research: the road ahead,2010,Sung-Min Ahn and Richard Simpson and Bonghee Lee,43,,1,1,Korean Association of Anatomists,Stem cell research has been widely studied over the last few years and has attracted increasing attention from researchers in all fields of medicine due to its potential to treat many previously incurable diseases by replacing damaged cells or tissues. As illustrated by hematopoietic stem research. understanding stem cell differentiation at molecular levels is essential for both basic research and for clinical applications of stem cells. Although multiple integrative analyses. such as genomics. epigenomics. transcriptomics and proteomics. are required to understand stem cell biology. proteomics has a unique position in stem cell research. For example. several major breakthroughs in HSC research were due to the identification of proteins such as colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) and cell-surface CD molecules. In 2007. the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) and the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) launched the joint Proteome Biology of Stem Cells Initiative.

57742,The c-myb negative regulatory domain,1996,TJ Gonda and D Favier and P Ferrao and EM Macmillan and R Simpson and F Tavner,,,,99-109,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,It is becoming increasingly clear that c-myb plays an essential role in controlling the proliferation and differentiation of haemopoietic cells. While this has been suggested for some time based on the preferential expression of myb in immature haemopoietic cells and the decrease in its expression on differentiation1.2. more recent loss-of-function studies have provided additional confirmation. Disruption of c-myb by gene targeting results in an abrupt failure of the foetal haemopoietic system to develop in mouse embryos3. while anti-sense oligonucleotides inhibit proliferation of both normal haemopoietic progenitor cells and transformed haemopoietic cell lines (eg ref. 4).

Evidence was presented to indicate that. in the mouse. IL-6 not only supports the growth of plasmacytomas in vitro. but also that it significantly enhances tumor progression in vivo. Analysis of the response of normal mouse B cells to IL-6 revealed the existence of a unique synergy between IL-6 and IL-1. The results obtained with T cells also highlighted the remarkable effects of the IL-1-IL-6 combination. In several experimental systems. including the generation of allogeneic cytolytic T cell responses. it appeared that accessory cells could be completely replaced by IL-1 and IL-6. whereas either cytokine used by itself was completely inactive. Analysis of the mode of action of IL-6 in T cell activation demonstrated the existence of two distinct mechanisms: induction of IL-2 biosynthesis and enhancement of T cell responsiveness to IL-2 and IL-4. Finally. it was reported that IL-6 is essential only during the early phases of T cell activation. thus indicating as far as T cells are concerned that IL-6 must be considered as a competence factor.,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC,14,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2786695,4161077569617694331,/scholar?cites=4161077569617694331,,,0

Despite these important functions. the regulatory mechanism underlying Chtop expression remains undetermined. Using Chtop-expressing human cell lines. we demonstrate that Chtop expression is controlled via an autoregulatory negative feedback loop whereby Chtop binds its own mRNA to retain intron 2 during splicing; a premature termination codon present at the 5΄ end of intron 2 leads to nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA. We also show that Chtop interacts with exon 2 of Chtop mRNA via its arginine-glycine-rich (RG) domain. and with intron 2 via its N-terminal (N1) domain; both are required for retention of intron 2.

However. the generation of phosphoinositides is not sufficient for insulin action. and it has been suggested that insulin regulation of glucose metabolism may involve both PI3K-dependent and -independent pathways. the latter being insulin specific. To test this hypothesis. we have designed a phosphoprotein screen to study insulin-specific phosphoproteins that may be either downstream or in parallel to PI3K. Nineteen insulin-regulated phosphospots were detected in the cytosol and high speed pellet fractions. only six of which were significantly regulated by platelet-derived growth factor.

57786,Studies in Wool Yellowing Part XIX: Improved Stability of Fluorescent-Brightened Fabrics to Simulated Sunlight,1968,AS Inglis and RJ Simpson,38,Textile Research Journal,2,109-117,Sage Publications,The effects of modifications of thiourea-formaldehyde treatment of bleached and unbleached wool fabrics have been studied with regard to the protection against uv radiation damage. Pretreatment of bleached fabric with stannous chloride improves the shrink resistance of the wool but causes some yellowing. Pretreatment with aluminum sulfate does not affect the color of the wool and improves the setting and insectproofing properties. Aluminum sulfate also acts as a mordant for the fluorescent brightening agent. A comparison of reducing agents used during the application of brightening agent shows that sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate is slightly superior to zinc formalde hyde sulfoxylate when wet wool is exposed to uv radiation. The concentration of formaldehyde has an important influence on the protection conferred by thiourea- formaldehyde during short reaction times.

While there are some molecular markers for this process. including the down-regulation of E-cadherin. our understanding of plasma membrane (PM) and associated proteins involved in EMT is limited.  To specifically explore molecular alterations occurring at the PM. we employed the cationic colloidal silica isolation technique to purify PM fractions from epithelial MDCK cells during Ras/TGF-β-mediated EMT.  Proteins in the isolated membrane fractions were separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE and subjected to nano-LC-MS/MS-based protein identification.  In this study. the first membrane protein analysis of an EMT model. we identified 805 proteins. and determined their differential expression using label-free spectral counting.  These data reveal that MDCK cells switch from cadherin-mediated to integrin-mediated adhesion following Ras/TGF-β-mediated EMT.  Thus. during the EMT process. E-cadherin. claudin 4. desmoplakin. desmoglein-2 and junctional adhesion molecule A were down-regulated. while integrins α6β1. α3β1. α2β1. α5β1. αVβ1 and αVβ3. along with their extracellular ligands collagens I. and V. and fibronectin. had increased expression levels.

57792,Micropreparative protein isolation from polyacrylamide gels following detection by high-resolution dynamic imaging: application to microsequencing.,1991,LD Ward and RJ Simpson,4,Peptide research,3,187-193,,Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is a high-resolving technique for separating proteins. Until recently. its use as a micro-preparative method for isolating microgram amounts of protein in a form suitable for structural analysis was limited by the difficulty in recovering material from the polyacrylamide matrix. This problem has been largely overcome by the development of chemically inert membranes that retain proteins after electroblotting from the polyacrylamide gel. The immobilized proteins are suitable for chemical identification by direct microsequence analysis. Nevertheless. the overall recoveries of proteins using this electrotransfer/blotting approach are low (28%-30%). This paper describes a phase-contrast technique that allows the visualization of proteins during the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This approach is suitable for the quantitative detection of proteins. Since no fixing/staining step is employed. proteins can be recovered in high yield (50%-65%). by passive elution. in a form suitable for microsequence analysis.

Here. we describe the large-scale purification of sMVs released from primary (SW480) and metastatic (SW620) human isogenic colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines using a combination of differential ultracentrifugation and isopycnic iodixanol density centrifugation. The yield of SW480-sMVs and SW620-sMVs was 0.75 mg and 0.80 mg. respectively. Both SW480-/SW620-sMVs are heterogeneous in size (100–600 nm diameter) and exhibit identical buoyant densities (1.10 g/mL). In contrast to exosomes. sMVs are ALIX−. TSG101−. CD63− and CD9−.

Here. we describe the development of an efficient and inexpensive method for parallel cloning. induction. and cell lysis to produce multiple fusion proteins in Escherichia coli using a 96-well format. Molecular cloning procedures. used in this HTP system. require no restriction digestion of the PCR products. All target genes can be directionally cloned into eight different fusion protein expression vectors using two universal restriction sites and with high efficiency (> 95%). To screen for well-expressed soluble fusion protein. total cell lysates of bacteria culture (∼ 1.5 mL) were subjected to high-speed centrifugation in a 96-tube format and analyzed by multiwell denaturing SDS-PAGE. Our results thus far show that 80% of the genes screened show high levels of expression of soluble products in at least one of the eight fusion protein constructs.

Varying degrees of success have been achieved using optical pyrometers or high-temperature thermocouples; however. none of these appear to be a panacea. A literature survey1-10 revealed a virtual lack of thermocouple drift data for this temperature and pressure range. This information void was unduly complicating many types of tests in which temperature control was important. In order to prevent every experiment from becoming a thermometry test. a facility was constructed and tests were restricted to those operating conditions and to commercially available noble-and refractory-metal thermocouples. The results. though limited in scope. have increased our knowledge of thermocouple performance and should be instrumental in the design of future experiments.It was beyond the scope of this work to study in detail the criteria for selection and application of high-temperature thermocouples to attain maximum thermoelectric stability. 11 Rather. in the scope of these tests. it was decided to select a few test materials. to rely on some of the reported test results to circumvent the cause of thermoelectric instability. and to obtain useful design information.,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:urP0JZOBBUsC,6,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EjlJAQAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA36&dq=info:GDpOKFJUq2YJ:scholar.google.com&ots=s3LvEkJHkl&sig=3Viop5ln0PBugB2BiubA4oQ6FIw,7398099524726438424,/scholar?cites=7398099524726438424,,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EjlJAQAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA36&dq=info:GDpOKFJUq2YJ:scholar.google.com&ots=s3LvEkJHkl&sig=3Viop5ln0PBugB2BiubA4oQ6FIw,0

We show that BRD2 is required for the recruitment of the MYST-type acetyltransferase KAT7 to rDNA loci. resulting in enhanced local acetylation of histone H4. In addition. LYAR binds a complex of BRD4 and KAT7. which is then recruited to rDNA independently of the BRD2-KAT7 complex to accelerate the local acetylation of both H4 and H3.

These perturbations manifest by changing cellular protein profiles. which. in turn. alter the quantitative relationship of tissue-specific proteins shed into the tissue/organ microenvironment. Such altered protein expression profiles in body fluids constitute molecular signatures or fingerprints that reflect the original perturbation of cellular networks.

When carcinomas become invasive. cancer cells either degrade BM or reprogram stromal fibroblasts to breach BM barrier and lead invasion of cancer cells into surrounding tissues in a process called fibroblast‐led invasion. However. tumor‐derived factors orchestrating fibroblast‐led invasion remain poorly understood. Here it is shown that although early‐stage primary colorectal adenocarcinoma (SW480) cells are themselves unable to invade Matrigel matrix. they secrete exosomes that reprogram normal fibroblasts to acquire de novo capacity to invade matrix and lead invasion of SW480 cells. Strikingly. cancer cells follow leading fibroblasts as collective epithelial‐clusters. thereby circumventing need for epithelial to mesenchymal transition. a key event associated with invasion.

VAMP8 and VAMP7 in B16 melanoma cells,2001,Nick Wade and Nia J Bryant and Lisa M Connolly and Richard J Simpson and J Paul Luzio and Robert C Piper and David E James,,Journal of Biological Chemistry,,,American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Syntaxin 7 is a mammalian t-SNARE involved in membrane transport between late endosomes and lysosomes. The aim of the present study was to use immunoaffinity techniques to identify proteins that interact with Syntaxin 7. We reasoned that this would be facilitated by the use of cells producing high levels of Syntaxin 7. Screening of a large number of tissues and cell lines revealed that Syntaxin 7 is expressed at very high levels in B16 melanoma cells. Moreover. the expression of Syntaxin 7 increased in these cells as they underwent melanogenesis. From a large scale Syntaxin 7 immunoprecipitation. we have identified six polypeptides using a combination of electrospray mass spectrometry and immunoblotting. These polypeptides corresponded to Syntaxin 7. Syntaxin 6. mVti1b. α-SNAP. VAMP8. VAMP7 and the PP1M phosphatase regulatory subunit. We also observed partial co-localization between Syntaxin 6 and Syntaxin 7. between Syntaxin 6 and mVti1b. but not between Syntaxin 6 and the early endosomal t-SNARE Syntaxin 13. Based on these. and previously reported data. we propose that Syntaxin 7/mVti1b/Syntaxin 6 may form discrete SNARE complexes with either VAMP7 or VAMP8 to regulate fusion events within the late endosomal pathway and that these events may play a critical role in melanogenesis. by guest. on January 30. 2013 www. jbc. org,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:9c2xU6iGI7YC,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_James13/publication/266059408_Syntaxin_7_complexes_with_mVti1b_Syntaxin_6_VAMP8_and_VAMP7_in_B16_melanoma_cells/links/56fb011e08aef6d10d9052ab.pdf,1151089518342343953,/scholar?cites=1151089518342343953,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_James13/publication/266059408_Syntaxin_7_complexes_with_mVti1b_Syntaxin_6_VAMP8_and_VAMP7_in_B16_melanoma_cells/links/56fb011e08aef6d10d9052ab.pdf,0

Different protein species of β‐catenin have been shown to exist in the cell and the relative proportions of these species are altered upon stimulation of cells with Wnt‐3a (Gottardi and Gumbiner. 2004). In order to determine whether posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of β‐catenin underlie these different protein species. we have used 2DE separation and immunoblotting with an antibody specific for β‐catenin. High‐resolution separation of differentially modified species of β‐catenin in 2DE required the addition of ASB‐16. a zwitterionic detergent that can solubilise integral membrane proteins. ASB‐16 was also necessary for focussing of other armadillo repeat proteins. such as γ‐catenin and p120‐catenin. 2DE using ASB‐16 allowed detection of a previously unreported …,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:qE4H1tSSYIIC,2,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/elps.201100671,18110083266881846586,/scholar?cites=18110083266881846586,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45078459/Solubilisation_of_the_armadillo-repeat_p20160425-9849-e85yo9.pdf,0

57891,Role of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography in protein isolation and purification,2003,C David Carr and RL Moritz and RJ Simpson,,"Purifying proteins for proteomics: A laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York",,179-208,,Identification OF LARGE NUMBERS OF PROTEINS by mass spectrometry (MS) and database searching requires significant separation of proteins or of peptides resulting from enzymatic digests prior to MS analysis (for details. see Chapter 8 of Simpson 2003). The number of proteins present in a typical cellular sample range from a few thousand to tens of thousands (see Chapter 1). When these proteins are digested enzymatically. the number of resulting peptides can be from a few tens of thousands to greater than a million. Clearly. mass spectrometers cannot distinguish between such large numbers of peptides. Hence. prefractionation of either the protein sample or the resultant peptide mixture is essential to identify the proteins being studied. Historically. protein samples were fractionated according to isoelectric point and molecular weight by two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis (see Simpson 2003 and Chapter 16 in this volume). Although this approach is still commonly used. chromatographic techniques are increasingly being used to achieve even higher levels of fractionation prior to MS analysis. Because of its very high resolving power. reversed-phase-high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) now has a central role in fractionation of complex polypeptide samples prior to MS analysis. RP-HPLC is usually combined with other techniques in the purification of protein and peptides. Ion-exchange chromatography. affinity chromatography. and related techniques are often used prior to reversed-phase separations to remove major impurities or to selectively isolate and/or concentrate the target molecules (for a discussion on …,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:w7CBUyPWg-0C,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4378248032591143151&hl=en&oi=scholarr,4378248032591143151,/scholar?cites=4378248032591143151,,,0

57898,An improved injection system for on. line liquid chromatographs: an application for high sensitivity phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analysis,1989,GEOFFREY S BEGG and RICHARD J SIMPSON,2,Techniques in Protein Chemistry,,79,Academic Press,"Twenty one years have elapsed since the first instrument for performing automated amino acid sequence analysis was described by Edman and Begg [1]. During the intervening period we have witnessed many improvements in both instrumentation [2] and identification of phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)—amino acids using HPLC [3] which now permit amino acid sequence information to be obtained at low picomole levels. For instance in 1967. approximately 10 nanomole of PTH-amino acid derivative was required for unambiguous identification whereas today this task can be performed using low picomole quantities (approximately 5 picomole). This has been largely due to the advent of microbore column (2.1 mm id) HPLC. One of the shortcomings of the first commercial automated sequencers introduced in 1970 and indeed in the more recent"" gas—phase"" sequencer described by Hewick et a1.[2] in 1981 was the failure to appreciate the extent of heat destruction of labile PTH-amino acids (eg. carboxymethyl—Cys.—Lys.—Asp.-Met.—Trp.—Gln.—Thr and-Ser). Considerable improvements in this area were made with on-line PTH—amino acid analysis [4].

KGaA,Cancer can be viewed as the endpoint of a series of genetic and epigenetic alterations in a cell or group of cells [7. 8]. Like many cancers. CRC is a heterogeneous disease resulting from mutations to genes such as p53. Ras or Apc. but which can also contain a variety of other mutations to genes such as MLH1 [9–11] or B-raf [12] capable of modulating tumor phenotype and outcome [6. 13](Fig. 7.2). Two forms of genetic instability. chromosomal instability (CIN). and microsatellite instability (MIN). have been described in CRC [14]. CIN tumors have a wide variation in chromosome number (ie their karyotypes are aneuploid with whole or large pieces of chromosomes continuously gained or lost)[15]. Although thought to involve a single dominant event (eg mutation in a gene important or chromosomal segregation [16]). the molecular events underpinning CIN are not fully understood.,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C,1,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/3527601562#page=129,8856848679007656581,/scholar?cites=8856848679007656581,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean-Charles_Sanchez/publication/226155579_Biomedical_Applications_of_Proteomics/links/02bfe50f08f7bc477e000000/Biomedical-Applications-of-Proteomics.pdf#page=129,0
57915,Protein Chromatography on Hydroxyapatite,2004,Richard J Simpson,,"Purifying Proteins for Proteomics: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York",,337-354,,KEY GOAL IN ANY PROTEIN PURIFICATION STRATEGY is to combine techniques that exploit different separation principles in order to achieve the greatest possible purification using the smallest number of steps (see Chapter 2). In general. combinations of separation techniques such as ion-exchange Chromatography (Chapter 6). hydrophobic Chromatography (Chapter 9). affinity Chromatography (Chapter 10). metal chelate affinity Chromatography (Chapter 12). size-exclusion Chromatography (Chapter 7). and reversed-phase Chromatography (Chapter 8) offer the most robust and straightforward approaches to designing a protein purification strategy. This is due to the fact that these separation methods are based on wellcharacterized and predictable principles. For a variety of reasons. hydroxyapatite Chromatography (HAP) has achieved only marginal popularity as a separation method for the purification of proteins. It has unpredictable chromatographic behavior. a relatively low sample loading capacity. and difficult handling properties. For these reasons. HAP is often referred to as a last resort purification method. However. because its modes of protein adsorption and desorption can differ significantly from techniques such as ion-exchange Chromatography. it is often possible to achieve fractionation using HAP when other conventional separation techniques have failed. In this chapter. the basic separation principles of HAP are discussed. along with a description of a number of applications. Two protocols are described.

Addition of a specific gastrin receptor antagonist. Proglumide. inhibits growth of these gastrin RIN cells in the absence of serum. These data suggest that gastrin acts as an autoceine growth factor for this islet cell line. The cis acting DNA elements determining gastrin gene transcription in islet cells were studied by transient expression of gastrin reporter genes transfected into RIN cell lines. Analysis of deletion mutants showed that only 80bp of 5'flanking DNA and the first exon were required for full expression in RIN cells. Gel retardation assays reveal that RIN cell nuclear extracts contain proteins which specifically bind to these gastrin promoter sequences but not to the insulin promoter.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Microbore column (≤ 2.1 mm i.d.) chromatography is an essential technique for purifying and manipulating (e.g. desalting. concentrating) low microgram quantities of proteins and peptides for microsequence analysis using presently available commercial sequencers (Simpson and Nice. 1987 a.b; Simpson et al.. 1988). Compared to their conventional column (4.6 mm i.d.) counterparts. microbore columns offer enhanced mass sensitivity (5–50 ng protein) and decreased peak volumes (40–60 µl) without any striking diminution of resolution. In this paper. the utility of microbore chromatography for high sensitivity peptide mapping is considered using the complete structure determination of murine interleukin-6 (IL6) as an example.

57945,Comparative protein and RNA analyses of extracellular vesicle subtypes: functional insights,2016,Maoshan Chen and Rong Xu and Alin Rai and David Greening and Richard J Simpson,,,,2-2,日本プロテオーム学会 (日本ヒトプロテオーム機構),EV annotation is a vexed question given that EVs have been variously classified based on cellular origin. biological function and/or mechanism of biogenesis. These concerns are widely discussed in the international EV community and stress the need for standardized nomenclature. In broad terms two predominant EV subtypes exist: 100-1000 nm diameter microvesicles (shed microvesicles. sMVs; membrane blebs) and 30-100 nm diameter exosomes. sMVs are generated by directly outward budding from the plasma membrane while exosome biogenesis involves the early/late endosomal pathway and the inward budding of multivesicular body (MVB) luminal membranes to form intraluminal vesicles (ILVs); MVBs then traffic to and fuse with the plasma membrane whereupon they release their ILV contents into extracellular space (exosomes). Given that most EV functional studies are undertaken using ill-defined (heterogeneous) EV preparations it is very difficult to ascribe function to a specific EV subtype? this may have possible ramifications in EV therapeutics design. especially in the event of possible EV-subtype-associated clinical side effects. These issues have engendered great interest in establishing how many naturally-occurring EV subtypes there are. and improving EV isolation methodologies. In this lecture I will provide an overview of EV subtype classification. including methods used for their isolation and characterization. Our recent findings show that human colon cancer-derived EVs have specific protein and RNA (mRNA. splice-variant mRNA. miRNA. and lncRNA) profiles that allow their discrimination.

TGF-β signalling is widely known for its role in cancer metastasis and is associated with cell migration in whole cell populations. Findings We extend these findings by investigating the role of TGF-β signalling in promoting migration and motility by imaging the signalling activity in live. individual MDA-MB-231 cancer cells utilizing a novel Smad3 Td-Tomato reporter adenovirus. Here we find that not all MDA-MB-231 cancer cells have similar TGF-β mediated Smad3 transcription activity and display at least two distinct migratory populations. Importantly. Smad3 activity was significantly higher within migratory cells compared to non-migrated cells in wound healing and transwell assays. Furthermore. time-lapse experiments showed that MDA-MB-231 cells displaying Smad3 activity moved faster and a greater distance compared to cells not displaying Smad3 reporter activity. Interestingly. despite being more motile than cells with undetectable levels of Smad3 activity. high Smad3 activity was detrimental to cell motility compared to low and medium level of Smad3 activity. Conclusions We have developed a method enabling real-time visualization of TGF-β signalling in single live cells. Breast cancer cell motility and migration is driven by sub-populations of cells with dynamic TGF-β-Smad3 activity. Those sub-populations may be responsible for tumor invasion and metastasis.,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:sfsSB7lKuh0C,0,http://gooa.las.ac.cn/external/share/1132194,,,,http://gooa.las.ac.cn/external/share/1132194,0

IL-6 exerts these multiple effects by binding to a heterodimeric cell surface receptor comprising at least two subunits; an 80-kDa glycoprotein referred to as IL-6R and a 130-kDa glycoprotein called gp-130 (2). Binding of IL-6 to the IL-6R is low affinity whereas its binding to the IL-6R/gp-130 complex is of high affinity (2). Crosslinking studies suggest that the high affinity receptor complex is formed by IL-6 interacting simultaneously with both IL-6R and gp-130 (3). The interaction between the IL-6R and gp-130 occurs extracellularly since it has been demonstrated that a soluble form of the human IL-6R (sh IL-6R). a truncated derivative which lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic region of the molecule. can potentiate the IL-6 response on target cells (2). Similarly. the shLL-6R/IL-6 complex can stimulate cells which fail to express the IL-6R but have gp-130 on their surface. Gp-130 has been shown to be responsible for transmission of the IL-6 signal as well as that of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). IL-11 and oncostatin-M (4. 5).Site-directed mutagenesis has been used extensively to identify the binding sites on IL-6 for both IL-6R and gp-130. The quantitative interpretation of these experiments has been difficult since many of the mutants were neither purified to homogeneity nor characterized.

57951,A New Family of Protein Kinases Containing a Double Leucine,2013,Donna S Dorow and Lisa Devereux and Richard J Simpson,,Methods in Protein Structure Analysis,,369,Springer Science & Business Media,Protein kinases play critical roles in the regulation of cellular processes. They control many of the pathways leading to the biochemical and morphological changes associated with cellular growth and division (Dunphy and Newport. 1988; Morgan et al.. 1989). They also serve as growth factor receptors and signal transducers and have been implicated in cellular transformation and malignancy (reviewed by Hunter and Karin. 1992; Posada and Cooper. 1992; Birchmeier et al.. 1993).While protein kinases vary widely in their primary structures. each contains a catalytic domain of 250-300 amino acids. consisting of 11 highly conserved motifs or subdomains separated by areas of reduced conservation (Hanks et al.. 1988). The presence of these motifs within a new sequence is strongly predictive of protein kinase activity. Specificity of a protein kinase can also be predicted by the sequence of two of the motifs (VIB and VIII) in which different residues are conserved in either the tyrosine or ser-ine/threonine specific kinases (Hunter. 1991). Within the two subgroups. protein kinases with similar substrates or modes of activation cluster into families (Hanks et al.. 1988) whose members share a higher degree of catalytic domain sequence identity with each other than with the entire protein kinase specificity class. Recently. several protein kinases with specificity for both tyrosine and serine/threonine have been reported (eg. Featherstone and Russell. 1991; Stern et al.. 1991; Ben-David et al.. 1991). however. they do not form a distinct family grouping on the basis of catalytic domain sequence identity.

57964,Proteomic Analysis of Exosomes Derived from SW480 Colon Cancer Cells with Functionally Restored Full-Length Adenomatous Polyposis Coli,2008,JWE Lim and EA Kapp and RL Moritz and MJ Layton and RJ Simpson,,J Proteomics,,,,When full-length wild-type APC (a tumor suppressor protein in CRC) is functionally restored into SW480 colon cancer cells (SW480APC). a less tumourigenic phenotype is observed with the re-distribution of β-catenin and E-cadherin to the cell periphery where they form functional adherens junctions (1). SW480APC cells also showed reduced TCF/LEF transcriptional signaling. lower proliferation rates. reduced cell migration and a reduced ability to form colonies in soft agar. Interestingly. its inability to establish xenograft in nude mice while maintaining growth in vitro highlighted critical contribution from the tumor cell microenvironment in vivo. Here. we performed a differential proteomic analysis of exosomes (ie secreted 30-100nm microvesicles) using a 1-DE/LC/MSMS approach to identify potential secreted biomarkers associated with APC. In total. more than 600 proteins were identified. including many previously described exosomal proteins involving in adhesion. MVBs biogenesis. signaling and trafficking. We also identified a Wnt signaling secreted antagonist. Dickkopfrelated protein 4 (Dkk-4). to be uniquely expressed in SW480APC cells by MS. immunoblotting. immunogold-EM. RT-PCR and microarray. To our best knowledge. this is the first report linking Dkk-4 with APC protein together in content and being localized in exosomes. We hypothesize that overexpression of Dkk-4 could provide a synergistic effect to further inhibit Wnt signaling extracellularly in conjunction with expression of functional APC and also its presence in exosomes may associated with long-range signaling in cell-to-cell communication.,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:MNNNGtAgD4EC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eugene_Kapp2/publication/247918732_Proteomic_Analysis_of_Exosomes_Derived_from_SW480_Colon_Cancer_Cells_with_Functionally_Restored_Full-Length_Adenomatous_Polyposis_Coli/links/00b4952afb4e036501000000/Proteomic-Analysis-of-Exosomes-Derived-from-SW480-Colon-Cancer-Cells-with-Functionally-Restored-Full-Length-Adenomatous-Polyposis-Coli.pdf,,,,,0

Many membrane associated proteins are overexpressed in disease (eg cancer). and the ectodomains proteolytically shed. Several clinically used biomarkers have membranous origin including. CEA in colorectal cancer and PSA in prostate cancer. For this reason membrane proteomes are of interest in the field of biomarker discovery. As part of the AOHUPO membrane protein initiative. we report a solubility-based phase separation of liver microsomes. using the nonionic detergent Triton X-114. The aqueous (detergent-depleted). detergent. and pellet (insoluble) fractions were obtained and subjected to SDS-PAGE in combination with LC-MS/MS.Using a false discovery rate of 1%. a total of 666 proteins were identified from the three phases. and classified with respect to Gene Ontology and Swissprot annotation. In addition. proteins unique to each fraction were analysed with respect to hydropathy and number of transmembrane spanning helices using the predictive algorithms GRAVY and TMHMM respectively. Interestingly. over 70% of proteins identified in the detergent phase were categorised as membrane according to Swissprot annotation.

57966,DIGE Analysis of Ras-Transformed Fibroblast Cell-Derived Exosomes,2008,H Ji and N Erfani and BJ Tauro and EA Kapp and H Zhu and RL Moritz and JWE Lim and RJ Simpson,,J Proteomics,,,,Ras is a small GTP binding protein. Specific point mutations can lead to a constant activation of Ras molecule. Over expression of mutated Ras molecule induced morphological transformation of NIH3T3 cells in culture and these transformed cells had the ability to induce tumors in nude mice. The activation mutations in Ras molecule play a significant role in tumor formation and development. The critical role of Ras signaling in human cancer is proved by the fact that it is one of the most highly mutated genes in human cancer. with approximately 90% incidence of activating mutation in pancreatic cancer. 50% in colon and 30% in many other types.Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (30-90 nm) that are secreted by cells upon fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. The molecular composition of exosome reflects their origin in endosomes as intraluminal vesicles. Recent studies have demonstrated that these vesicles apply a broad array of inhibitive effects on the immune system. such as blocking of signaling. proliferation. cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis in immune cells.,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:dFKc6_kCK1wC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/31954897/JPBS2.318.pdf,,,,,0

57980,Pharmacoproteomics: Strategies for Identifying New Diagnostic and Prognostic Markers for Colorectal Cancer,2007,Richard J Simpson,,,,1-1,日本プロテオーム学会 (日本ヒトプロテオーム機構),Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death in the Western World. Early detection is the single most important factor influencing outcome of CRC patients. If identified while the disease is still localized CRC is treatable. To improve outcomes for CRC patients there is a pressing need to identify biomarkers for the early detection (diagnostic markers). prognosis (prognostic indicators). tumor responses (predictive markers) and disease recurrence (monitoring markers). Despite recent advances in the use of genomic analysis for risk assessment. in the area of biomarker identification genomic methods have yet to produce reliable candidate markers for CRC. For this reason. attention is now being directed towards protein chemistry or proteomics as an analytical tool for biomarker identification. Here. we discuss various proteomics technologies with reference to how they may contribute to CRC biomarker discovery. One such strategy uses a combination of continuous free flow electrophoresis (FFE) in the first dimension. a liquid-based IEF technique. followed by rapid RP-HPLC (1-6 min/analysis) in the second dimension. Imaging software has been developed to present the FFE/RP-HPLC data in a virtual 2D format. Demonstration of the method is presented using proteome analysis of human plasma and urine specimens. Additionally. we describe strategies for analyzing the ‘secretome’of human CRC cell lines. the human platelet membrane proteome. tissue interstitial fluid from tumor-derived human colon carcinoma cell line xenografts. and a proteomics approach for analyzing the effect of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs on human …,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:qmtmRrLr0tkC,0,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jhupo/2007/0/2007_0_1/_article/-char/ja/,,,,,0

57987,Concentrating Acrylamide Gel Spots,2006,Richard J Simpson,2006,Cold Spring Harbor Protocols,28,pdb. prot4585,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,This protocol describes a method for concentrating gel bands or spots excised from 1D or 2D acrylamide gels. Several replicate protein bands (or spots) are often required to provide sufficient material for sequencing. In these situations. it is necessary to excise several stained protein bands or spots from the gels and pre-concentrate them prior to electroblotting for amino-terminalsequencing or internal sequence analysis following in-gel proteolytic (or chemical) fragmentation. In the method described below. concentration is done by re-electrophoresis of the gel pieces in a simple SDS-PAGE gel poured in a single conventional glass Pasteur pipette.,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:-7ulzOJl1JYC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/09e3/3892d7f14340a1498f0bd923e6bc22605164.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/09e3/3892d7f14340a1498f0bd923e6bc22605164.pdf,0

Peptide mapping. electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. and automated N-and C-terminal sequencing identified a peptide (“tag” peptide).-Ala-Ala-Asn-Asp-Glu-Asn-Tyr-Ala-Leu-Ala-Ala-COOH. encoded by a small metabolically stable RNA of E. coli (10Sa RNA) attached to truncated C termini of the recombinant protein. A mutant strain of E. coli in which the chromosomal 10Sa RNA gene (ssrA) is disrupted does not produce this C-terminal modification. confirming that the tag peptide originates from the ssrA gene.Recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli occasionally contain structural modifications that restrict their useful-ness as therapeutic drugs or reagents for structure-function relationship studies.

First. the interaction of sIL-6R with IL-6 covalently attached to the biosensor-chip was characterized from the dependence of the surface plasmon resonance response upon the concentration of receptor injected into the biosensor.  A binding constant for the interaction between sIL-6R and IL-6 was then determined from the biosensor response observed for mixtures of IL-6 and receptor.  A binding constant of 5    10     7     M     -     1     has been obtained for the interaction of sIL-6R with two equivalent and independent sites on an essentially dimeric IL-6 preparation produced using the pUC vector system. and also for the interaction of sIL-6R with a monomeric IL-6 preparation that was univalent in its interaction with receptor.,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:Br1UauaknNIC,0,https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-5388e397-42d0-3995-bdb3-1a3495218439,,,,,0

These receptors are heterooligomeric proteins forming chloride channels which are gated by GABA and allosterically regulated by benzodiazepines. It is well established that chronic (several days) exposure of cortical neurons to GABA reduces the density of ligand binding sites of GABAA receptors (Hablitz et al.. 1989). a phenomenon known as down regulation. Accompanying this process are persistent losses both of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents and C1-currents evoked by applied GABA. In order to investigate the downregulation of GABAA receptor polypeptides from the neuronal surface. we have utilized the impermeant cleavable labeling reagent 3. 3'-dithiopropionyl 1-sulfosuccinimidyl l'-glycyltyrosine ([125I] DPSgt)(Bretscher and Lutter. 1988) in combination with quantitative …,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:EPG8bYD4jVwC,0,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01898855,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Boris_Gorovits/publication/256999994_MPSA_short_communications/links/5a955f4baca2721405683372/MPSA-short-communications,0

Sialidases are common in these animals. but are irregularly distributed among microbial species or even strains. Bacteria possessing sialidase generally have close contact with animals. These observations make sialidases interesting subjects for evolutionary studies. Bacterial sialidases are very variable in terms of their molecular and enzymic properties. However. a common origin of sialidases is indicated by comparison of the primary structures deduced from cloned and sequenced bacterial sialidase genes. Homology is mainly based on conserved and repeated sequences (1). From sequence alignments. 23 amino acids were found to be conserved in 11 sialidase proteins.

Indeed. the enormous amount of information obtained from 2D gels has encouraged the development of computerised gel scanners in order to analyse the data for tabulation in a protein database (2. 3). Although the weakness of this approach has been the difficulty in identifying protein spots of interest. recent advances in protein sequencing technology now permits protein identification by direct sequence analysis (4).

This problem was largely overcome by on-line PTH-amino acid analysis (Machleidt et al.. 1980). In spite of the advantages of on-line PTH-amino acid analysis several shortcomings still exist in the commercial sequencers (Applied Biosystems Inc.. models 470A and 477A equipped with model 120A PTH-amino acid analyser). The percentage of sample injected onto the HPLC column is< 50% while the remainder is transferred to a non-refrigerated fraction collector where labile PTH-amino acids decrease due to destruction. A second difficulty is maintaining parameters (flow rate. time) which control the transfer of liquid from the conversion flask of the sequencer into the sample loop of the HPLC injection valve.",True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:1Aeql8wG3wEC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9345300952275698104&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

Because this molecule also supported the in vitro growth of mouse plasmacytomas.” it was provisionally designated interleukin-HP1 (HP1). An identical molecule subsequently was purified from virally infected fibroblasts.'A plas-macytoma growth factor previously identified by R. Nordanº in supernatants of macrophage cell line P388D1 also turned out to be identical with the T cell and fibroblast product.'a This work was supported in part by the Belgian State-Prime Minister's Office-Science Policy Programming (Grant No. 82/87-39). dResearch assistant with the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique.

Peptide mapping of subnanomole quantities of protein introduces a number of manipulative problems (eg desalting after reduction and alkylation. concentration and bufferexchange into solvents suitable for subsequent enzymic digestion protocols. multi-step chromatographic purification protocols) which are readily solved by microbore chromatography. In our laboratory we have relied heavily on microbore chromatography protocols for the structural characterization of rat epidermal growth factor. ovine basic fibroblast growth factor. murine leukemia inhibitory factor. murine granulocyte colony stimulating factor and more recently. murine (IL6)(Simpson et al.. 1985; 1987; 1988).Elucidation of the complete structure of IL6 was determined on less than 2 nmol (40 pg) of starting material at a speed comparable to that of recombinant DNA methodologies. Details of our study on murine IL6 are presented as examples of microbore chromatography (Fig. 1). To avoid losses. enyzmic digests were routinely performed in the presence of a non-ionic detergent (eg 0.02%(w/v) Tween 20. Pierce Surfactant-AMPS 20) and buffer-changes of HPLC fractions (typically. containing TFA-acetonitrile) were affected by diluting the fractions with an appropriate buffer (eg aq NH4HCO3) containing 0.01%(w/v) Tween 20. Highly-charged peptides which are not retained on conventional RP-HPLC systems (eg Fig. IB) and elute with the column breakthrough were isolated using small pore size packings (eg ODS-Hypersil) and …,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:w1MjKQ0l0TYC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5907039323098909990&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

We have previously reported the advantages of short (less than 10cm). microbore (less than 2 mm id) HPLC columns for the high sensitivity detection (5-10 ng) and preparation of subnanomole quantities of proteins and polypeptides in small volumes (less than 100 ul) suitable for microsequence analysis.In this communication we are reporting the further use of microbore column technology for:(1) Sample concentration.(II) desalting and buffer-exchange.(III) analytical and preparative peptide mapping.(IV) assessing sample purity and aromatic amino acid content (in conjunction with diode-array detection) and high sensitivity amino acid analysis.

Boston. MA,Epidermal growth factor (EGF). first isolated by Cohen(l) in 1962 from adult mouse submaxillary glands. is a single-chain polypeptide of 53 residues with three disulfide bonds(2.3). It is a potent stimulator of cellular proliferation (4.5) and inhibitor of gastric acid secretion(6). Although the chemical and biological properties of EGF have been studied extensively over the past 20 years (for reviews see 7–9) a detailed understanding of its three-dimensional structure is still not known. The lack of success with tertiary structure studies (e.g. X-ray crystallography NMR) may. in part. be attributable to the N-terminal heterogeneity encountered with many EGF preparations; this heterogeneity has been studied in detail for two forms of mouse EGF which differ by a lack of one N-terminal residue(10.11).,True,8gICzg4AAAAJ:t-hv7AR41mYC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-1787-6_4,,,,,0

The strategies investigated included: the addition of a denaturing co-solvent (dimethylsulfoxide. DMSO). alteration of the thermocycling temperature profile. and manual post-analysis sequence editing. The data was analyzed by both Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems Division (PE/ABD) and phred basecalling programs and then evaluated by several different methods. The study showed that the addition of DMSO can improve the number of correct basecalls and the number of bases with high confidence levels. especially if the sequence obtained using the manufacturer’s recommended conditions was of poor quality. Altered thermocycling temperature protocols can be helpful. but the impact is not as reproducible as the effect of DMSO. Manual editing produced significant improvements in the number of correct basecalls for this GC-rich template. Most of the data was produced using dye-terminator chemistry with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase.

It focuses on the analysis of the metallome. a term encompassing both metals bound to biomolecules within the cell membrane and metals either free or bound in interstitial fluids [1]. Analysis of metal ions bound to low abundant proteins requires an element specific detector of particularly high sensitivity. An ICP-MS is capable of detecting most elements important to biology (including P. S. Se. Si) at sub-ppb levels [2]. making it the ideal analytical tool for the trace detection of metals bound to proteins. By connecting size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to ICP-MS. the proteins in the sample can be separated based on molecular size. allowing for the detection of elements in specific protein mass fractions.

Although DARPins are already very stable molecules. molecular dynamics simulations. equilibrium denaturation experiments. structural studies. and recent NMR experiments suggested that the unfolding of the original C-terminal capping repeat (C-cap). taken from a natural ankyrin repeat protein. limits the stability of the initial DARPin design.

Based on the analysis of over 200 X-ray structures representing more than 100 non-redundant VH domain sequences. we have come to the conclusion that the marked structural variability of the VH framework 1 region is caused by three residues: the buried side-chain of H6. which can be either a glutamate or a glutamine residue. the residue in position H7. which may be proline only if H6 is glutamine. and by H9 (H10 according to a new consensus nomenclature). which has to be either glycine or proline if H6 is a glutamate residue.

A'selectively infective phage'consists of two components. a filamentous phage particle made non-infective by replacing its N-terminal domains of gene3 protein (g3p) with a ligand-binding protein. and an'adapter'molecule in which the ligand is linked to those N-terminal domains of g3p which are missing from the phage particle. Infectivity is restored when the displayed protein binds the ligand and thereby attaches the missing N-terminal domains of g3p to the phage particle.

One of the most potent selection technologies for such applications is ribosome display. It works entirely in vitro. and this has two important consequences. First. since no transformation of any cells is required. libraries with much greater diversity can be handled than with most other techniques. Second. since a library does not have to be cloned and transformed. it is very convenient to introduce random errors in the library by PCR-based methods and select improved binders.

In affinity maturation experiments. binders with the highest affinities in the library are typically isolated through selections for decreased off rate using a suitable selection platform (e.g. phage display or ribosome display). In such experiments. the library is initially exposed to biotinylated antigen and the binding reaction is allowed to proceed. A large excess of unbiotinylated antigen is then added as a competitor to capture the vast majority of rapidly dissociating molecules; the slowly dissociating library members can subsequently be rescued by capturing the biotin-carrying complexes. To optimize the parameters for such affinity maturation experiments. we performed both deterministic and stochastic simulations of off-rate selection experiments using different input libraries.

Since both domains. each engineered for stability and folding efficiency. could now be obtained in native and soluble form by themselves. fluorescence spectra of VH and VL in unfolded. folded and associated states can be reported. VH and VL only associate when they are native. and the stability of the heterodimer is strongly increased in the presence of antigen. VH rapidly folds into an hyperfluorescent intermediate. and the native state is reached in two parallel. proline-independent reactions.

Both prolyl-peptide bonds which are cis in the native state affect the refolding kinetics of long-term denatured protein.

Introduction of heavy chain framework mutations previously found to improve the folding of a related antibody led to improved folding of T15 fragments and improved physiology of the host E.coli cells. Manipulation of the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of the framework-mutated forms of T15 further improved folding and bacterial host physiology. but no improvement was seen in the wild type. suggesting the existence of a hierarchy in sequence positions leading to aggregation.

While antibodies represent a well-established tool to study protein interactions of extracellular domains and secreted proteins. as well as in fixed and permeabilized cells. they usually cannot be functionally expressed in the cytoplasm of living cells. Non-immunoglobulin protein-binding scaffolds have been identified that also function intracellularly and are now being engineered for synthetic biology applications. Here we used the Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) scaffold to generate binders to fluorescent proteins and used them to modify biological systems directly at the protein level.

To obtain statistically meaningful results. a large number of unbinding trajectories are calculated; they involve a total simulation time of more than 200 ns. Simulations are carried out with a time-dependent perturbation and in the presence of a constant force. The two techniques. which provide complementary information. induce unbinding by favoring an increase in the distance between the ligand and the antibody. This distance is an appropriate progress variable for the dissociation reaction and permits direct comparison of the unbinding forces in the simulations with data from atomic force microscopy (AFM). The time-dependent perturbation generates unfolding pathways that are close to equilibrium and can be used to reconstruct the mean force; i.e …,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC,49,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283601951034,5611452674212933850,/scholar?cites=5611452674212933850,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.18.9999&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

We investigated the energetic consequence of restoring the disulfide bond and the nature of residue H6 (Glu or Gln). which is poised to interact with Ser H92 in the recombinant scFv fragment obtained from this antibody. In the scFv fragment derived from this antibody. the stabilizing effect of Gln H6 over Glu was found to be as large as the effect of reintroducing the disulfide bond.

Many of them have been developed to bind to folded proteins. yet cellular networks for signaling and protein trafficking often depend on binding to unfolded regions of proteins. This type of binding can thus be well described as a peptide–protein interaction. In this review. we compare different peptide-binding scaffolds. highlighting that armadillo repeat proteins (ArmRP) offer an attractive modular system. as they bind a stretch of extended peptide in a repeat-wise manner. Instead of generating each new binding molecule by an independent selection. preselected repeats – each complementary to a piece of the target peptide – could be designed and assembled on demand into a new protein. which then binds the prescribed complete peptide.

Properties such as antigen binding constants. urea denaturation curves and expression of soluble scFv fragments were identical with those of the parental fragment with the (Gly4Ser)3 linker.

When beta-lactamase is diluted from this complex into denaturant solution. its unfolding rate is identical to that from the native state. while the unfolding rate from the molten globule state is too fast to be measured. Electrospray mass spectrometry shows that the rate of proton exchange in beta-lactamase in the complex at 48 degrees C is slower than in the absence of GroEL at the same temperature. and resembles the exchange of the native state at 25 degrees C. Similarly. the final number of protected deuterons is higher in the presence of GroEL than in its absence.

Moreover. they can be used to determine the molecular properties that cell surface proteins must fulfill to act as receptors for viral glycoproteins. Here we show that LVs pseudotyped with receptor-targeted Nipah virus (NiV) glycoproteins effectively enter into cells when they use cell surface proteins as receptors that bring them closely enough to the cell membrane (less than 100 Å distance). Then. they were flexible in receptor usage as demonstrated by successful targeting of EpCAM.

NiV-LVs could be produced at up to two orders of magnitude higher titers compared to their MV-based counterparts and were at least 10.000-fold less effectively neutralized than MV glycoprotein pseudotyped LVs by pooled human intravenous immunoglobulin. An important finding for NiV-LVs targeted to Her2/neu was an about 100-fold higher gene transfer activity when particles were targeted to membrane-proximal regions as compared to particles binding to a more membrane-distal epitope.

When ATP and GroES were added after the labeling pulse. refolding of CypA could be accelerated to rates comparable to the amide proton exchange.

Modern high-throughput methods for drug discovery require working with pure protein. but this has been a challenge for GPCRs. and thus the success of screening campaigns targeting soluble. catalytic protein domains has not yet been realized for GPCRs. Therefore. most GPCR drug screening has been cell-based. whereas the strategy of choice for drug discovery against soluble proteins is HTS using purified proteins coupled to structure-based drug design. While recent developments are increasing the chances of obtaining GPCR crystal structures. the feasibility of screening directly against purified GPCRs in the unbound state (apo-state) remains low.

DARPins are interesting molecules for HIV envelope inhibitor design. as their high-affinity binding differs from that of antibodies. DARPins in general prefer epitopes with a defined folded structure. We probed whether this capacity favors the selection of novel gp120-reactive molecules with specificities in epitope recognition and inhibitory activity that differ from those found among neutralizing antibodies. The preference of DARPins for defined structures was notable in our selections. since of the four gp120 modifications probed as selection targets. gp120 arrested by CD4 ligation proved the most successful.

58900,Ribosome display of mammalian receptor domains,2005,Bernhard Schimmele and Nico Gräfe and Andreas Plückthun,18,Protein Engineering Design and Selection,6,285-294,Oxford University Press,Many mammalian receptor domains. among them a large number of potential therapeutic target proteins. are highly aggregation-prone upon heterologous expression in bacteria. This severely limits functional studies of such receptor domains and also their engineering towards improved properties. One of these proteins is the Nogoreceptor. which plays a central role in mediating the inhibition of axon growth and functional recovery after injury of the adult mammalian central nervous system. We show here that the ligand binding domain of the Nogoreceptor folds to an active conformation in ternary ribosomal complexes. as formed in ribosome display. In these complexes the receptor is still connected. via a C-terminal tether. to the peptidyl tRNA in the ribosome and the mRNA also stays connected.

Therapies that target EGFR can promote the dimerization of EGFR with other ErbB receptors. which is associated with the development of drug resistance. Understanding how interactions among ErbB receptors alter EGFR biology could provide avenues for improving cancer therapy. We found that EGFR interacted directly with the CYT1 and CYT2 variants of ErbB4 and the membrane-anchored intracellular domain (mICD). The CYT2 variant. but not the CYT1 variant. protected EGFR from ligand-induced degradation by competing with EGFR for binding to a complex containing the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl and the adaptor Grb2.

We report here that the massive overproduction of even such ""benign"" proteins can cause surprisingly efficient promoter deletions in the expression plasmid. leading to the growth of only non-producers. when expression is not well repressed in the newly transformed bacterial cell. Because deletion is so facile. it might impact on high-throughput protein production. e.g. for structural genomics. where not every expression parameter will be monitored. We studied the high-level expression of several robust non-toxic proteins using a T5 promoter under lac operator control. Full induction leads to no significant growth retardation. We compared expression from almost identical plasmids with or without the lacI gene together in strains expressing different levels of LacI. Any combination without net overexpression of LacI led to an efficient promoter deletion in the plasmid. although the number of growing colonies and even the plasmid size – all antibiotic-resistant non-producers – was almost normal. and thus the problem not immediately recognizable. However. by assuring sufficient repression during the initial establishment phase of the plasmid. deletion was completely prevented. The deletions in the insufficiently repressed system are caused entirely by the burden of high-level translation. Since the E. coli Dps protein. known to protect DNA against stress in the stationary phase. is accumulated in the deletion mutants. the mutation may have taken place during a transient stationary phase.

The way the integrase is provided on a separate plasmid closely mimicks expression of the integrase from a λ. lysogen.

58907,Escherichia coli producing recombinant antibodies,1993,A Pluckthun,19,,,233,CRC Press,Antibodies are a target of very diverse biotechnological interest. They are used widely in the laboratory. and hardly any branch of biology or biochemistry can do without them; be it for qualitative assays (eg. Western blots. microdiffusion tests. or immunohistology). quantitative assays (radioimmunoassays (RIAs) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)]. or immunoaffinity purification of compounds of interest. Even in organic chemistry. there has been interest in employing antibodies directed to suitably designed transition state analogs as catalysts [1–3]. In medicine. antibodies are of pivotal importance in diagnostics. generally in ELISA formats. In therapy. antibodies have been used as well. mostly still experimentally. and especially in the field of tumor therapy and diagnostics. there is currently great interest in antibody-based reagents [4]. For all these applications. different molecular properties of the antibodies are considered important. and different fragments may thus be appropriate. With the exception of whole antibodies. most of them can now be advantageously prepared in Escherichia coli in functional form (see Refs. 5. 6). As all these applications have special needs. many antibody-based products had already been designed before the advent of gene technology. In most cases. manipulation of the structure was still carried out by proteolysis and chemical cross-linking. Here. the real advantage of recombinant DNA technology and bacterial expression sets in: not only can the antibody be produced reliably with comparatively little work in bacteria. but. with almost no extra effort after cloning. its gene can be modified.

Because of the high similarity between JNK1. JNK2 and JNK3. it is very difficult to generate small-molecule inhibitors with this discriminatory power. Thus. we have recently selected protein binders from the designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) library which were indeed isoform-specific inhibitors of JNK1 with low nanomolar potency. Here we provide the structural basis for their isotype discrimination and their inhibitory action. All our previous attempts to generate crystal structures of complexes had failed.

Computational methods to determine the thermodynamically stable conformation of complexes from the structure of the binding partners. such as RosettaDock. might potentially emerge to become a promising alternative to traditional structure determination methods. However. while models virtually identical to the correct experimental structure can in some cases be generated. the main difficulty remains to discriminate correct or approximately correct models from decoys. This is due to the ruggedness of the free-energy landscape. the approximations intrinsic in the scoring functions. and the intrinsic flexibility of proteins. Here we show that molecular dynamics simulations performed starting from a number top-scoring models can not only discriminate decoys and identify the correct structure. but may also provide information on an initial map of the free energy landscape that elucidates the binding mechanism.,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:kUhpeDhEZMUC,9,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006182&rev=2,6783070917310834262,/scholar?cites=6783070917310834262,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006182&rev=2,0

While many of these versatile small proteins can be expressed both in the intracellular and extracellular milieu in cultured cells and in living organisms. they can also be functionalized by fusing them to different protein domains in order to regulate or modulate their target proteins in diverse manners. For example. protein binders have been employed to degrade. trap. localize or enzymatically modify specific target proteins.

Therefore. most computational design efforts so far have been directed toward creating proteins that recapitulate existing folds. Here we present a strategy centered upon the design of novel intramolecular interfaces that enables the construction of a target fold from a set of starting fragments. This strategy effectively reduces the amount of computational sampling necessary to achieve an optimal sequence. without compromising the level of topological control. The solenoid architecture has been a target of extensive protein design efforts. as it provides a highly modular platform of low topological complexity.

An essential prerequisite for such a technology is a dArmRP geometry that matches the peptide bond length. To this end. we determined a large set (n = 27) of dArmRP X-ray structures. of which 12 were previously unpublished. to calculate curvature parameters that define their geometry. Our analysis shows that consensus dArmRPs exhibit curvatures close to the optimal range for modular peptide recognition.

From today's perspective. it is fair to conclude that this promise has been realized in two areas of the three. As research tools. MAbs have been invaluable: their ability to selectively bind and localize specific antigens. detect and identify new ligands and their receptors. and agonize and/or antagonize specific molecular interactions continues to provide a useful and enabling technology to basic research endeavors. Similarly. MAbs have demonstrated enormous practical impact as diagnostic tools. Recent advances in clinical diagnostic medicine continue to rely heavily on the use of MAb-based reagents for detecting and localizing antigens of clinical import. In contrast. however. MAbs have not proven to have major impact on human disease therapy. With the single exception of an immunosup pressive MAb against the T-cell antigen. CD3. MAbs have as yet found few meaningful applications as therapeutic agents. During the 1980s. a set of technologies to clone. modify and express genes encoding MAbs was developed. These breakthroughs permitted MAbs to be genetically engineered which consequently gave them the potential to greatly enhance their therapeutic utility as well as significantly expand their research and diagnostic applications.

This myriad of functions is accomplished by their modular interactions with downstream intracellular transducers. such as heterotrimeric G proteins and arrestins. Assembling a specific GPCR–G protein pair as a purified complex for their structural and functional investigations remains a challenging task. however. because of the low affinity of the interaction. Here. we optimized fusion constructs of the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein and engineered versions of rat Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1). coexpressed and assembled in vivo with Gβ and Gγ. This was achieved by using the baculovirus-based MultiBac system. We thus generated a functional receptor–G protein fusion complex. which can be efficiently purified using ligand-based affinity chromatography on large scales. Additionally. we utilized a purification method based on a designed ankyrin repeat protein tightly binding to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP-DARPin) that may be used as a generic approach for a large-scale purification of GPCR–G protein fusion complexes for which no ligands column can be generated.

We recently demonstrated that complementary N‐ and C‐terminal fragments of dArmRPs form high‐affinity complexes that resemble the structure of the full‐length protein. and that these complexes bind their target peptides. We now demonstrate that dArmRPs can be split such that the fragments assemble only in the presence of a templating peptide. and that fragment mixtures enrich the combination with the highest affinity for this peptide. The enriched fragment combination discriminates single amino acid variations in the target peptide with high specificity.

They are based on single-chain Fv fragments with a flexible hinge region from mouse IgG3 and an amphiphilic helix fused to the C-terminus of the antibody fragment. The sequence of the helix was taken either from that of a four-helix bundle design or a leucine zipper. optionally extended with a short cysteine containing peptide. To investigate the folding and assembly process of antibody fragments in E. coli. co-expression experiments with proline cis-trans-isomerase and disulfide isomerase were carried out. These folding steps do not appear to be limiting the folding process in E. coli.Recent advances in the bacterial expression technology of antibodies (Pliickthun. 1991). PCR cloning of antibody libraries (Orlandi et al.. 1989) and library screening with the phage display technology (Marks et al.. 1991) are decisive steps along a path to antibodies based almost entirely on molecular biology and biotechnology. This account will address the question of which antibody fragments are compatible with functional expression in E. coli. and by what folding mechanism they achieve the native state.

Previous studies suggested that the chaperone activity of FkpA is independent of its PPIase activity (Ramm and Pluckthun. 2000. 2001) as it is also observed for proteins devoid of cis-prolines. Overexpression of FkpA suppresses the formation of inclusion bodies from a defective folding variant of the maltose-binding protein and promotes the reactivation of denaturated citrate synthase (Arie et al.. 2001). Coexpression of FkpA can dramatically improve functional periplasmic production of single-chain fragments of antibodies. even those not containing cis-prolines (Bothmann and Pluckthun. 2000). The folding-assisting function of FkpA is hypothesized to be due to its interaction with early folding intermediates preventing their aggregation. and its ability to reactivate inactive proteins. possibly by binding to partially unfolded species (Ramm and Pluckthun. 2000). Amino acid sequence alignment and homology modelling indicated that the FkpA dimer is comprised of two domains. the N-terminal dimerization domain and the C-terminal FK506-binding domain (FKBP). The high PPIase enzymatic activity towards proteins (among the highest in bacteria) and the chaperone function of the dimeric FkpA are suggested to be mechanistically related and confined to the FKBP domain (Ramm and Pluckthun. 2001). Nevertheless. protein binding and the occupation of the active site can be independent. and thus these two functions are not identical.

Like all icosahedral dsDNA bacteriophages. the morphogenesis of bacteriophage λ proceeds through the assembly of an empty prohead. which is subsequently filled with DNA. The shell of the procapsid is composed mainly from gpE. DNA packaging is accompanied by expansion of the shell and binding of the 109 amino-acid protein gpD. The binding sites for gpD are created or exposed only after the prohead expands (Imber et al.. 1980). gpD is not required for prohead assembly itself but is essential if a full-length genome is to be stably accommodated in the λ capsid. Thus. it is believed that gpD is necessary for stabilizing the capsid. In addition.

The association of bio-physical conditions with movement patterns of large marine predators has been demonstrated in diverse taxa. However. obtaining subsurface data that are spatio-temporally relevant to the decisions made by benthically-foraging species can be challenging. Between 2009 and 2015. grey seals were captured on Sable Island. Nova Scotia. Canada during summer and fall and instrumented with high-resolution archival GPS tags. These tags recorded location data as well as depth (m). temperature (°C). and light level measurements during dives. until animals returned to the haulout site to breed. Hidden Markov models were used to predict apparent foraging along movement tracks for 79 individuals (59 females. 20 males) every 3 h. In situ measurements were used to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration (mg m− 3) and temperature within the upper-water column (50 m) and temperature and depth at the bottom of dives. As chlorophyll-a could only be estimated from 10:00 to 14:00 AST for dive depths ≥50 m. we formulated two generalized linear mixed-effects models to test the association of predicted grey seal behavioural states with oceanographic conditions and phytoplankton biomass: the first representing conditions of the upper-water column likely to influence primary productivity. and a second model including environmental conditions encountered by grey seals at the bottom of dives. when seals were more likely to be foraging.

If this could be done in a manner dependent on a cell surface receptor. two layers of specificity would be obtained: one for the cell type and the other for the cytosolic target. Bacterial protein toxins have naturally evolved such systems. Anthrax toxin consists of a pore-forming translocation unit (protective antigen (PA)) and a separate protein payload. When engineering PA to ablate binding to its own receptor and instead binding to a receptor of choice. by fusing a designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin). uptake in new cell types can be achieved. Prepore-to-pore conversion of redirected PA already occurs at the cell surface. limiting the amount of PA that can be administered and thus limiting the amount of delivered payload. We hypothesized that the reason is a lack of a stabilizing interaction with wild-type PA receptor. We have now reengineered PA to incorporate the binding domain of the anthrax receptor CMG2. followed by a DARPin. binding to the receptor of choice. This construct is indeed stabilized. undergoes prepore-to-pore conversion only in late endosomes. can be administered to much higher concentrations without showing toxicity. and consequently delivers much higher amounts of payload to the cytosol.

A longstanding design approach uses genetic fusion to join protein homo-oligomer subunits via α-helical linkers to form more complex symmetric assemblies. but this method is hampered by linker flexibility and a dearth of geometric solutions. Here. we describe a general computational method that performs rigid three-body fusion of homo-oligomer and spacer building blocks to generate user-defined architectures. while at the same time significantly increasing the number of geometric solutions over typical symmetric fusion. The fusion junctions are then optimized using Rosetta to minimize flexibility. We apply this method to design and test 92 dihedral symmetric protein assemblies from a set of designed homo-dimers and repeat protein building blocks. Experimental validation by native mass spectrometry. small angle X-ray scattering. and negative-stain single-particle electron microscopy confirms the assembly states for 11 designs. Most of these assemblies are constructed from DARPins (designed ankyrin repeat proteins). anchored on one end by α-helical fusion and on the other by a designed homo-dimer interface. and we explored their use for cryo-EM structure determination by incorporating DARPin variants selected to bind targets of interest.

Although several structures have been solved for GPCR-G protein complexes. structural studies of the complex in a physiological lipid membrane environment are lacking.

A frequently cited family of methods employs phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases) to attach probes. provided as conjugates of Coenzyme A. This method appears attractive. as only short peptide tags genetically fused to the protein of interest are needed as conjugation sites. Here. we describe observations we made when evaluating such protocols for delicate single-molecule applications where we require a particular combination of dyes. low background binding or low labeling of other proteins. and a high degree of labeling.   Results When we tested a PPTase-acceptor peptide couple with several experimental protocols and various CoA conjugates for labeling of a protein on the cell surface. we noticed substantial non-specific labeling. For the first time. we provide here a quantification of the non-specific fraction of the signals obtained using appropriate controls. We further present evidence that this background is due to CoA-dye conjugates entering the cell. where they may be covalently attached to endogenous proteins. However. when studying cell-surface proteins. most fluorescent readouts require that labeling is strictly limited to the protein of interest located at the cell surface. While such data have so far been missing in the literature. they suggest that for applications where labeling of unwanted molecules would affect the conclusions. researchers need to be aware of this potential non-specificity of PPTase methods when selecting a labeling strategy.

The consensus version recognises alternating arginines and lysines. with one dipeptide per repeat. For generating new binding specificities. the rapid and robust analysis by crystallography is key. Yet. we have previously found that crystal contacts can strongly influence this analysis. by displacing the peptide and potentially distorting the overall geometry of the scaffold.

To shield the peptide-binding surface from crystal contacts. we rigidly fused two DARPins to the N-and C-terminal repeat of the dArmRP and linked the two DARPins by a disulfide bond.

59074,Rapid Selection of High-affinity antibody scFv fragments using ribosome display,2018,Birgit Dreier and Andreas Plückthun,,,,235-268,Humana Press. New York. NY,Ribosome display has proven to be a powerful in vitro selection and evolution method for generating high-affinity binders from libraries of folded proteins. It works entirely in vitro. and this has two important consequences. First. since no transformation of any cells is required. libraries with much greater diversity can be handled than with most other techniques. Second. since a library does not have to be cloned and transformed. it is very convenient to introduce random errors in the library by PCR-based methods and select improved binders. Thus. a true directed evolution. an iteration between randomization and selection over several generations. can be conveniently carried out. e.g.. for affinity maturation. either on a given clone or on the whole library. Ribosome display has been successfully applied to antibody single-chain Fv fragments (scFv). which can be selected not only for specificity but also for …,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:JH5k92_tO-AC,2,https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-8648-4_13,11166027572137290999,/scholar?cites=11166027572137290999,,,0

Because some membrane proteins are notoriously unstable at room temperature. and available LCPs undergo transformation to lamellar phases at low temperatures. development of stable low-temperature LCPs for biophysical studies of membrane proteins is called for. Monodihydrosterculin (MDS) is a designer lipid based on monoolein (MO) with a configurationally restricted cyclopropyl ring replacing the olefin.

Cell-based assays complement traditional biochemical and biophysical methods. as they allow for molecular interaction analysis. mode of action studies and even drug screening processes to be performed under physiologically relevant conditions. In most cellular assays. biomolecules are usually labeled to achieve specificity. In order to overcome some of the drawbacks associated with label-based assays. we have recently introduced cell-based molography as a biosensor for the analysis of specific molecular interactions involving native membrane receptors in living cells. Here. we expand this assay to cytosolic protein-protein interactions. First. we created a biomimetic membrane receptor by tethering one cytosolic interaction partner to the plasma membrane. The artificial construct is then coherently arranged into a two-dimensional pattern within the cytosol of living cells. Thanks to the molographic sensor. the specific interactions between the coherently arranged protein and its endogenous interaction partners become visible in real-time without the use of a fluorescent label. This method turns out to be an important extension of cell-based molography because it expands the range of interactions that can be analyzed by molography to those in the cytosol of living cells.,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:xii_ZKWM4-0C,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13462,16468515866682580843,/scholar?cites=16468515866682580843,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13462,0

Although latent infection of long-lived CD4+ T cells contributes to viral persistence. the finding of low-level replication in elite controllers suggests a more active sanctuary where productively infected cells are shielded from immune destruction.Methods: We used flow cytometric cell sorting to isolate cell populations from lymph nodes (LN) obtained from rhesus macaques (RM) with chronic SIVmac239/251 infection and varying SIV replication set-points. ranging from progressive infection to elite control. In selected RM. LN biopsies were obtained before and after in vivo CD8+ cell depletion with monoclonal antibody M-T807R1. Sorted populations were quantified for replication-competent SIV by inductive co-culture and for SIV RNA by qRT-PCR.Results: In all SIV-infected RM. the frequency of SIV+ cells …,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:uUvzmPk0f8oC,1,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/aid.2013.1500,702296422836442613,/scholar?cites=702296422836442613,,,0

While the periplasmic E. coli disulfide isomerase DsbA is required for this assembly. its functional over-expression does not significantly change the folding limit. Similarly. the functionally over-expressed E. coli proline cistrans isomerase does not change the amount of all but one of the antibody fragments. not even if DsbA is over-expressed as well. Therefore. aggregation steps in the periplasm appear to compete with periplasmic folding. and they may occur before disulfide formation and/or proline cis-trans isomerization takes place and be independent of their extent.,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:CMvovTBb2okC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Achim_Knappik/publication/15434680_The_Effect_of_Folding_Catalysts_on_the_In_Vivo_Folding_Process_of_Different_Antibody_Fragments_Expressed_in_Escherichia_coli/links/0912f5069e17411558000000/The-Effect-of-Folding-Catalysts-on-the-In-Vivo-Folding-Process-of-Different-Antibody-Fragments-Expressed-in-Escherichia-coli.pdf,18388243481779576482,/scholar?cites=18388243481779576482,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Achim_Knappik/publication/15434680_The_Effect_of_Folding_Catalysts_on_the_In_Vivo_Folding_Process_of_Different_Antibody_Fragments_Expressed_in_Escherichia_coli/links/0912f5069e17411558000000/The-Effect-of-Folding-Catalysts-on-the-In-Vivo-Folding-Process-of-Different-Antibody-Fragments-Expressed-in-Escherichia-coli.pdf,0

The course of auxin transport is defined by the polar subcellular localization of the PIN proteins. a family of auxin efflux transporters. However. little is known about the composition and regulation of the PIN protein complex. Here. using blue‐native PAGE and quantitative mass spectrometry. we identify native PIN core transport units as homo‐ and heteromers assembled from PIN1. PIN2. PIN3. PIN4 and PIN7 subunits only.

59109,Probing the Conformation States of Neurotensin Receptor 1 Variants by NMR Site‐Directed Methyl Labeling,2020,Inguna Goba and David Goricanec and Dominik Schum and Matthias Hillenbrand and Andreas Plückthun and Franz Hagn,,ChemBioChem,,,,G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key players in mediating signal transduction across the cell membrane. However. due to their intrinsic instability. many GPCRs are not suitable for structural investigations. Various approaches have been developed in recent years to remedy this situation. ranging from the use of more native membrane mimetics to protein-stabilization methods. The latter approach typically results in GPCRs that contain various numbers of mutations. However. probing the functionality of such variants by in vitro and in vivo assays is often time consuming. In addition. to validate the suitability of such GPCRs for structural investigations. an assessment of their conformation state is required. NMR spectroscopy has been proven to be suitable to probe the conformation state of GPCRs in solution. Here. by using chemical labeling with an isotopelabeled methyl probe. we show that the activity and the conformation state of stabilized neurotensin receptor 1 variants obtained from directed evolution can be efficiently assayed in 2D NMR experiments. This strategy enables the quantification of the active and inactive conformation states and the derivation of an estimation of the basal as well as agonistinduced activity of the receptor. Furthermore. this assay can be used as a readout when re-introducing agonist-dependent signaling into a highly stabilized. and thus rigidified. receptor by mutagenesis. This approach will be useful in cases where low production yields do not permit the addition of labeled compounds to the growth medium and where 1D NMR spectra of selectively 19F-labeled receptors are not sufficient to resolve signal …,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:wkm4DBaukwsC,0,https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1585066/file.pdf,,,,https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1585066/file.pdf,0

59111,Escherichia coil Producing Recombinant Aodtodies,2020,Andreas Plückthun,,Recombinant Microbes for Industrial and Agricultural Applications,,,CRC Press,Antibodies are a target of very diverse biotechnological interest. They are used widely in the laboratory. and hardly any branch of biology or biochemistry can do without them; be it for qualitative assays (eg. Western blots. microdiffusion tests. or immunohistology). quantitative assays [radioimmunoassays (RIAs) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)]. or im-munoaffinity purification of compounds of interest. Even in organic chemistry. there has been interest in employing antibodies directed to suitably designed transition state analogs as catalysts [1. 2 and 3]. In medicine. antibodies are of pivotal importance in diagnostics. generally in ELISA formats. In therapy. antibodies have been used as well. mostly still experimentally. and especially in the field of tumor therapy and diagnostics. there is currently great interest in antibody-based reagents [4]. For all these applications. different molecular properties of the antibodies are considered important. and different fragments may thus be appropriate. With the exception of whole antibodies. most of them can now be advantageously prepared in Escherichia coli in functional form [see Refs. 5. 6]. As all these applications have special needs. many antibody-based products had already been designed before the advent of gene technology. In most cases. manipulation of the structure was still carried out by proteolysis and chemical crosslinking. Here. the real advantage of recombinant DNA technology and bacterial expression sets in: not only can the antibody be produced reliably with comparatively little work in bacteria. but. with almost no extra effort after cloning. its gene can be modified.In this …,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:IHkkN1K1AlAC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2615378837822101489&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

These modules could then be reassembled in any desired order to bind to. in principle. arbitrary sequences. thereby circumventing any new rounds of selection.

Here. we generate two synthetic protein binder tools manipulating different parameters of Decapentaplegic (Dpp). a morphogen thought to control Drosophila wing disc patterning and growth by dispersal; while HA trap blocks Dpp dispersal. Dpp trap blocks Dpp dispersal and signaling in the source cells. Using these tools. we found that while posterior patterning and growth require Dpp dispersal. anterior patterning and growth largely proceed without Dpp dispersal. We show that dpp transcriptional refinement from an initially uniform to a localized expression and persistent signaling in transient dpp source cells render the anterior compartment robust to blocking Dpp dispersal. Furthermore. neither Dpp dispersal nor signaling is critical for lateral wing growth.

In situ production of protein-based therapeutics by tumour cells provides an attractive alternative to treatment with repeated high bolus injections. as secretion by the tumour itself could provide high local concentrations that act in a paracrine fashion over an extended duration. For this purpose. we have developed a non-oncolytic adenoviral delivery system that allows for targeting of Ad5 to discrete cell types by redirecting viral tropism to cell surface biomarkers through the use of interchangeable adapters. Furthermore. we recently described the engineering of a protein-based ‘shield’ that is coated on the Ad5 capsid. which. together with the retargeting adapters. allows for improved tumour specificity and prevention of viral clearance. To test this delivery strategy in vivo. SCID-beige mice bearing orthotopic BT474 xenografts were treated with three doses of either a cancerspecific. non-replicative Ad5 that encodes a secreted anti-HER2 antibody. trastuzumab. in its genome. or with the protein therapeutic itself (Herceptin®). We have employed state-of-the-art whole tumour clearing and imaging with confocal microscopy at high spatial resolution in 3D to assess biodistribution. and large volumetric imaging has revealed that the secreted therapeutic diffuses significantly throughout the tumour leading to a therapeutic effect and delayed tumour outgrowth.

Unlike conventional methodologies.non-degeneracy permits equal representation of all encoded amino acids and effectively eliminates termination codons from saturated positions. We have previously described both ‘MAX’ randomisation. which saturates physically separated codons and ‘ProxiMAX’ randomisation. which saturates contiguous codons. Both allow the additional advantage of encoding only required amino acids without reference to codon sequence. but their methodologies are quite different. Whilst MAX randomisation employs a manual process of selectional hybridisation between individual oligonucleotides and a conventionally-randomised template. ProxiMAX relies on saturation cycling; repeated cycles of blunt-ended ligation. Type IIS restriction and PCR amplification. MAX randomisation is thus typically employed in the research laboratory to engineer active sites of enzymes (or α-helices within other proteins). whilst ProxiMAX is now a chiefly commercial. automated process employed in antibody engineering. Here we present the application of MAX randomisation to engineer libraries of Armadillo Repeat Proteins (ArmRPs). α-helical proteins that selectively bind extended peptides. We have utilised the MAX randomisation technique to engineer ArmRPs for the generation of gene libraries encoding multiple repeat modules. saturating seven positions and encoding between 4 and 18 amino acids within each location. achieving excellent correlation between the design and observed specifications …,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:MGPUR4WVBMEC,0,http://publications.aston.ac.uk/id/eprint/41643/,,,,,0

We investigated whether alternative recognition motifs selected for ligand binding from synthetic libraries of Designed Ankyrin Repeat proteins (DARPins) could be incorporated into CARs. As proof of principle. we linked a DARPin (DARPin E01) specific for EGFR to the CAR signaling domain and compared anti-tumor function with a high affinity CAR containing the Cetuximab scfv. which recognizes an overlapping epitope. Our in vitro results show that DARPin CARs designed with flexible linkers and with short and long spacer domains exhibit specific cytotoxicity. cytokine secretion and proliferation against EGFR+ targets that is comparable to the Cetuximab CAR.

Despite large progress in instrumentation and screening throughput. many proteins still resist yielding diffraction-quality crystals. To overcome this bottleneck. strategies like homology screening. fragmentation. surface entropy reduction. and synthetic symmetrization have been introduced. but they all require genetic manipulation of the target protein. Only the binding of crystallization aids. such as Fab fragments or nanobodies circumvent this limitation. We have developed a modular approach for crystallization aids that extends the initial concept in several ways. adding molecular dimension and surface composition as new screening variables.

Since both approaches are elaborate and require the availability of sufficient amounts of stable target molecules we are developing a modular system that allows a rational design of peptide recognition modules.

Following up with analyses of other proteins. Teytelman et al. discovered that highly expressed loci were always enriched in ChIP peaks. regardless of which protein was pulled down.

59166,Synthetic Antibodies with a Known Three-Dimensional,2012,A Plückthun and A Skerra and R Glockshuber and J Stadimuller,39,Protein Structure and Protein Engineering,,123,Springer Science & Business Media,Antibodies constitute promising targets for investigating proteinligand interactions. since the overall folding of the domains seems to be quite independent of the structure of the binding site. Several three-dimensional structures of antibody Fab fragments have been determined and their common features have been compared (Kabat 1978; Amzel and Poljak 1979; Davies and Metzger 1983). More recently. structures of complexes consisting of Fab fragment and protein antigen (Amit et al. 1986; Colman et al. 1987; Sheriff et al. 1987) were solved and have brought to light again the question of conformational changes in the antigen and antibody (Marquart and Deisenhofer 1982; Huber and Bennett 1987). The common structural feature of all antibody domains is a sandwich of antiparallel 8-sheets. The architecture of the vari-able domains is characterized by a framework of fairly constant resi-dues (arranged in the 8-sheets) linked by three hypervariable loops (complementarity determining regions. CDR) per chain. These hypervariable loops contain the residues that make contact with the antigen.Since the framework structure is fairly well conserved between antibodies. the loop conformations as the decisive factor in determining the specificity have been the subject of theoretical studies. Several approaches to the prediction of loop conformations have been taken. including conformational search procedures combined with energy minimization or molecular dynamics (Chothia et al. 1986; Fine et al. 1986; Shenkin et al. 1987; Bruccoleri and Karplus 1987). and structural ho-mology searches (de la Paz et al. 1986; Chothia et al. 1986; TA Jones and …,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:zwpXiJ37cpgC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ow_pCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA123&dq=info:8x-gmIEk9G8J:scholar.google.com&ots=hKFnZDQIVf&sig=fbLO-4d8iwxr4EOGgRVza07eDtw,,,,,0

59173,3.2 Engineering aggregation resistance in IgG by two independent mechanisms: lessons from comparison of Pichia pastoris and mammalian cell expression,2012,Jonas V Schaefer and Andreas Plückthun,,Folding and Aggregation of IgGs-Influence of Mutations and Expression Systems,,65,Universität Zürich,Aggregation is an important concern for therapeutic antibodies. since it can lead to reduced bioactivity and increase the risk of immunogenicity. In our analysis of immunoglobulin G molecules (IgGs) of identical amino acid sequence but produced either in mammalian cells (HEK293) or the yeast Pichia pastoris. dramatic differences in their aggregation susceptibilities were encountered. The antibodies produced in Pichia were much more resistant to aggregation under many conditions. a phenomenon found to be mainly caused by two factors. First. the mannose-rich glycan of the IgG from Pichia. while slightly thermally destabilizing the IgG. strongly inhibited its aggregation susceptibility. compared to the complex mammalian glycan. Second. on the Pichia produced IgGs amino acids belonging to the αfactor pre-pro sequence were left at the N-termini of both chains. These additional residues proved to considerably increase the temperature of the onset of aggregation and reduced the aggregate formation after extended incubation at elevated temperatures. The attachment of these residues to IgGs produced in cell culture confirmed their beneficial effect on the aggregation resistance. Secretion of IgGs with native N-termini in the yeast system became possible after systematic engineering of the precursor proteins and the processing site. Taken together. the present results will be useful for the successful production of full-length IgGs in Pichia pastoris. give indications on how to engineer aggregation-resistant IgGs and shed new light on potential biophysical effects of tag sequences in general.,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:G36d5HCDkJYC,0,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/68828/1/20121469.pdf#page=73,,,,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/68828/1/20121469.pdf#page=73,0

Hence my talk will focus on the strengths and weaknesses of vectors for use in vivo. considering both areas of local application (eg. to treat known local tissue targets such as the retina) and systemic delivery (to access widespread and dispersed targets). Because gene therapy is increasingly becoming regarded as a regular pharmaceutical approach (albeit where the active component chances its molecular form following arrival at the target site) it is important to assess pharmacological aspects of the agents being developed.

Auf den ersten Blick unerwartet. und ohne dass ihm selbst das damals bewusst gewesen sein kann. hat er auch ein intellektuelles Gerüst geliefert. mit dem der Mensch Biomoleküle optimieren kann. In den letzten Jahren ist diese evolutionäre Strategie zu einer wichtigen Quelle von biopharmazeutischen Wirkstoffen geworden. Aber erst kürzlich konnte man Technologien entwickeln. die effizient genug sind. um das evolutionäre Potenzial optimal zu nutzen. und die Evolution im Reagenzglas ermöglichen. Wir werden deshalb ohne Zweifel eine weitere rasante Beschleunigung dieses Fortschritts sehen. Die Grundlage für diese Technologien bilden Darwins sorgfältige Beobachtungen der Natur. insbesondere auf seiner fünf Jahre dauernden Reise mit der HMS Beagle. Sie führten ihn zu einer umfassenden Theorie über die Vielfalt der Lebensformen. Sein Hauptwerk von 1859 On the origin of species by means of natural selection erklärt die Aufspaltung der Organismen in verschiedene Arten und ihre Entwicklung als Folge von Variation und natürlicher Selektion (Abb. 1). Der entscheidende Punkt–nicht immer genügend betont–der evolutionären Strategie in der Natur ist die immer wiederkehrende Abfolge von Veränderung (Diversifizierung) und Auswahl (Selektion) der geeignetsten Varianten. Es ist ein zyklischer Prozess (Abb. 1d). Das heisst. die Evolution benutzt die Politik der kleinen Schritte. derer es allerdings sehr viele braucht.

59182,ESGCT 2010 Oral Presentations,2010,Toni Cathomen and T VandenDriessche,21,HUMAN GENE THERAPY,,1358-1396,,Effective gene therapy requires robust delivery of the desired genes into the relevant target cells. long-term gene expression. and minimal risks of secondary effects. The development of efficient and safe non-viral vectors would greatly facilitate clinical gene therapy studies. However. non-viral gene transfer approaches typically result in only transient gene expression in most primary cells. The use of non-viral gene delivery approaches in conjunction with the latest generation transposon technology based on Sleeping Beauty (SB) or piggyBac transposons may potentially overcome some of these limitations. In particular. a large-scale genetic screen in mammalian cells yielded novel hyperactive SB transposases. resulting in robust and stable gene marking in vivo after hematopoietic reconstitution with cord bloodderived CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in mouse models. Moreover. the first-in-man clinical trial has recently been approved to use redirected T cells engineered with SB for gene therapy of B-cell lymphoma. Finally. induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) could be generated after genetic reprogramming with transposons encoding reprogramming factors. Moreover. transposons can be used to ‘‘coax’’the differentiation of iPS into transplantable cell types. These recent developments underscore the emerging potential of transposons in gene therapy applications and induced pluripotent stem generation for regenerative medicine.(VandenDriessche et al..

From the recorded holograms. the three-dimensional shape of the molecules can numerically be reconstructed. The experimental setup as well as the numerical reconstruction of low energy electron holograms from individual bio-molecules shall be discussed. Since most biological objects are transparent for electrons they introduce only a phase shift to the incident electron wave. We present a method to not only retrieve the absorbing (as most known methods do) but also the phase properties of the object wave.

Low protein presentation on phage might be caused by premature cytoplasmic folding. leading to inefficient translocation into the periplasm. As translocation is an intermediate step in phage assembly. we tested the display levels of a range of proteins using different translocation pathways by employing different signal sequences. Directing proteins to the cotranslational signal recognition particle (SRP) translocation pathway resulted in much higher display levels than directing them to the conventional posttranslational Sec translocation pathway. For example. the display levels of designed ankyrin-repeat proteins (DARPins) were improved up to 700-fold by simply exchanging Sec-for SRP-dependent signal sequences. In model experiments this exchange of signal sequences improved phage display from tenfold enrichment to> 1.000-fold enrichment per phage display selection round. We named this method ‘SRP phage display’and envision broad applicability. especially when displaying cDNA libraries or very stable and fast-folding proteins from libraries of alternative scaffolds.Phage display is an in vitro selection method that allows polypeptides with desired properties to be extracted from large collections of variants1. 2. Most commonly. filamentous phages. such as f1. M13 and fd. that infect Escherichia coli are used for phage display.

59197,Directed Evolution of a G-Protein Coupled Receptor,2006,Casim A Sarkar and Andreas Plueckthun,,The 2006 Annual Meeting,,,,G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of transmembrane receptors. serving to transfer cues from the extracellular space into eukaryotic cells. This relay of information is often mediated by the binding of extracellular ligands to these receptors. which in turn initiate intracellular signaling cascades via associated intracellular G-proteins. In addition to constituting approximately 1% of mammalian genomes. members of the GPCR superfamily also represent the targets for more than 50% of all pharmaceutical agents. Despite their critical biological and clinical importance. the only high-resolution structure available is that of bovine rhodopsin. which. unlike most GPCRs. is naturally abundant. Most naturally or heterologously expressed GPCRs do not yield quantities necessary for performing detailed biophysical studies. so protein expression is currently a major bottleneck in obtaining detailed three-dimensional structures. An attractive idea for increasing the expression level of a GPCR is to perform directed evolution on the sequence; however. to date. most techniques for performing directed evolution have been confined to soluble biomolecules. Here. we present a novel approach that extends this powerful method to the engineering of integral membrane proteins. We have used directed evolution to increase the heterologous expression level of a GPCR and also to engineer its ligand-binding selectivity. Interestingly. several of the mutations that arose from these screens were unexpected and these will be discussed in the context of GPCR folding and function.,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:7Hz3ACDFbsoC,0,https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2006/techprogram/P67875.HTM,,,,,0

Crystallographic analysis of the scFv in its antigen-bound and free state showed that only few mutations. which do not make direct contact to the antigen. lead to a 500-fold affinity improvement over its potential germ line precursor. These results suggest that the affinity optimization of very high affinity binders is achieved by modulating existing interactions via subtle changes in the framework rather than by introducing new contacts.

The consequences of choosing Fab or scFv fragments. the properties of suitable expression vectors or the influence of the E. coli strain have been extensively summarized elsewhere (Plückthun et al. 1996). Even when paying attention to all these components and experimental conditions. it has become clear that the yield of recombinant antibody fragments is variable and these variations are a direct consequence of their primary sequences (Wörn and Plückthun 2001).

We have now investigated the properties of FkpA in vitro. The peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity of FkpA was found to be among the highest of any such enzyme with a protein substrate. yet FkpA is not able to enhance the proline-limited refolding rate of the disulfide-free hu4D5-8 scFv fragment. probably due to inaccessibility of Pro-L95. Nevertheless. the yield of the soluble and functional scFv fragment was dramatically increased in vitro in the presence of FkpA. Similar effects were observed for an scFv fragment devoid of cis-prolines. We are thus forced to conclude that the observed folding-assisting function is independent of the isomerase activity of the protein.

Md.: Waverly Press,The epithelial glycoprotein-2 is abundantly expressed on many solid tumors and is a suitable target for antibody-based therapy. In the present study. an antiepithelial glycoprotein-2 single-chain Fv (scFv) was derived from the hybridoma MOC31 by phage display. Despite its high affinity (KD = 3.9 X 10-9 M). however. this antibody fragment failed to significantly enrich at lung tumor xenografts in mice. mostly because of its insufficient thermal stability. To overcome this limitation. the antigen-binding residues of the MOC31 scFv fragment were grafted onto the framework of the highly stable and well-folding anti-c-erbB2 scFv 4D5. Further modification of the resulting 4D5 MOC-A. which was performed by transferring eight additional residues of the heavy chain variable domain core of the parent MOC31 antibody. produced 4D5 MOC-B. resulting in increased serum stability at 37degreeC and also significantly improved …,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:-nhnvRiOwuoC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2983899922437895693&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

59225,Studying Protein Structure and Function by Directed Evolution,1998,Andreas Plückthun,,,,37-57,Springer. Boston. MA,Directed molecular evolution is a powerful strategy for investigating the structure and function of proteins. When a function. such as ligand binding. can only be carried out by the native state of the protein. the biological selection for this function can be used to improve structural properties of the protein. Thus. thermodynamic stability and folding efficiency. which is the ability to avoid aggregation during folding. can be optimized. Three methods of selection are reviewed: phage display. selectively infective phages (SIP) and ribosome display. a cell-free method. Examples for optimizing antibody stability are discussed. In one case. antibodies have been generated under evolutionary pressure. which are stable in the absence of any disulfide bond. in the other case. a kink in the first strand of the beta-sandwich of kappa domains has been optimized.,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:LgRImbQfgY4C,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-4895-9_4,,,,,0

All three methods gave evidence for the occurrence of a major kinetic intermediate during the refolding of the denatured. oxidized scFv fragment.  This intermediate is formed within the first 30 s of folding and comprises exchange-protected amide protons of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids. most of which are localized within the inner β-sheet of the V     L     domain.  Some of these amino acids are extremely conserved among different antibodies. suggesting the potential to form a kinetic intermediate in the folding reaction to be a conserved feature during the evolution of antibody variable domains.  The absence of a stable intermediate in VH suggests that aggregation problems are mainly caused by folding intermediates this domain.  From mutagenesis studies. based on sequence comparisons of antibodies giving large differences infolding efficiency. residues could be elucidated which (i) improve the percentage of folded antibody in vitro and in E. coli and (ii) which play a role in the lysis of the bacterial host expressing the antibodies.  The role of these and further amino acids in a variety of antibody frameworks has been investigated.

Its pH-dependent misfolding to a nonnative form. which is not an aggregate. is not prevented by GroE. From these results. a model is proposed. in which the crucial role of GroE consists of allowing the change from I to I to take place in the complex.

To investigate the physical basis of possible protein stabilization strategies. the effect of substitutions of glycine residues by alanine in helical regions was determined. One Gly to Ala substitution (G316A) located in the central core of the subunit was found to strongly stabilize the protein. while the other mutations are neutral or destabilize the protein. The effect seen for the stabilizing mutant in irreversible heat denaturation correlates with the first transition in folding equilibrium experiments that is observable by fluorescence. but not with the one detected by circular dichroism measurements or in dilution-induced dissociation experiments. The stabilizing effect of a Gly to Ala substitution therefore does not seem to be caused by an entropic effect on the unfolded state.

This reaction has been shown to proceed by a two-step mechanism where the intron catalyzes transesterification reactions at specific phosphodiester bonds. with conservation of the total number of bonds [1]. Self-splicing requires only an exogenous guanosine co-factor. and no external energy source. One prediction of this mechanism is that the reaction should be readily reversible. A related reaction. cyclization of the excised intron RNA. was previously shown to be reversible [2]. We have demonstrated that the self-splicing reaction of the Tetrahymena Group I intron is fully reversible in vitro [3]. Incubation of ligated exon RNA with the linear intron in the absence of guanosine produces a molecule containing the splice site sequences of the precursor RNA. 5'exon sequences which can pair with sequences …,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:0CzhzZyukY4C,0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100648/,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00325711.pdf,0

In addition. certain NMR experiments require protonated methyl groups in the presence of a perdeuterated background. All these requirements are most easily satisfied when using Escherichia coli as the expression host. Here we describe a workflow. starting from a temperature-stabilized mutant of the α1B-adrenergic receptor. obtained using the CHESS methodology. into an even more stable species. in which flexible parts from termini were removed and the intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) was stabilized against proteolytic cleavage. The yield after purification corresponds to 1–2 mg/L of D2O culture. The final purification step is ligand-affinity chromatography to ensure that only well-folded ligand-binding protein is isolated. Proper selection of detergent has a remarkable influence on the quality of NMR spectra. All optimization steps of sequence and detergent are monitored on a small scale by monitoring the melting temperature and long-term thermal stability to allow for screening of many conditions. The stabilized mutant of the α1B-adrenergic receptor was additionally incorporated in nanodiscs. but displayed slightly inferior spectra compared to a sample in detergent micelles.

59275,Christiane Schaffitzel. Christian Zahnd. Patrick Amstutz,,Beatrice Luginbuhl and Andreas Pluckthun,,,,,,Ribosome display is a method for selecting and further evolving functional proteins for their properties of interaction. It is performed completely in vitro and does not involve living cells at any step (Hanes and Phickthun 1997). This method has two main advantages over most other selection methods. First. the screening of very large libraries with up to 10 14 members is possible. In contrast. other selection methods such as phage display (Winter et al. 1994; Smith 1985). the yeast two-hybrid system (Fields and Song 1989; Chien et al. 1991). or cell-surface display methods (Georgiou et al. 1993; Boder and Wittrup 1997) all necessarily involve transformation steps in which the original library is introduced into cells. This step limits the size of the library by the transformation efficiency. which is about 10 9 to 10 10 per microgram of DNA in E. coli (Dower and Cwirla 1992) and about---10 7 per microgram of DNA in yeast. Second. there is a built-in evolution during the ribosome display selection procedure. During the many PCR amplification steps that are part of the ribosome display protocol. low-fidelity DNA polymerases that introduce mutations are usually used. In most cases. the mutations are detrimental. However. in some cases. a beneficial mutation is introduced randomly that improves the stability or affinity of the displayed protein. leading to a selection advantage of this clone in the subsequent ribosome display cycle. Thus. the sequence space sampled is not limited by the initial size of the library applied to ribosome display. and diversification can be easily introduced during subsequent selection rounds if low-fidelity polymerases are used.

Oliver Middendorp. Patrick Amstutz. Urs Lüthi. Andreas Plückthun & Alcide Barberis β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1) is a membrane bound protease. One distinct cleavage product. a peptide. is responsible for the formation of amyloid plaques and thus is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease I (De Strooper & Konig. 1999; Lin et al.. 2000; Vassar et al.. 1999). In collaboration with ESBAtech AG (Schlieren. Switzerland) this project aims to generate AR protein based inhibitors. In analogy to the selection of APH inhibitors. a two-step procedure was applied. first selecting a pool of binders by ribosome display. which is subsequently screened for inhibitors in an in vivo setup. We performed four ribosome-display selection rounds against BACE1 (as described in Binz et al.(Binz et al.. 2004)) and obtained pools of BACE1-binding AR proteins (see Fig. 1). These pools were further subjected to an in vivo screening assay in yeast for the identification of BACE1 inhibitors. Several AR proteins could be isolated that inhibited BACE1 activity in vivo in yeast. These inhibitors were then recloned for recombinant expression in E. coli. The proteins were produced and purified. Currently. in vitro BACE1 inhibition tests are being conducted to demonstrate that indeed enzyme inhibitors have been selected.,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:T8_be82Iz5gC,0,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/163269/1/20050003.pdf#page=145,,,,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/163269/1/20050003.pdf#page=145,0

SFV is a member of the Alpha virus genus of the Togaviridae family. which replicates in the cytoplasm of the host cell. The viral replication machinery is encoded by its nonstructural proteins 1-4 (2342 amino acids). which are synthesized as one polyprotein and subsequently cleaved (Kujala et al.. 2001). The functions of the different NSPs are still under investigation. It is known that NSP1 is involved in RNA capping and mutations leading to inhibition of the guanylyltransferase activity are lethal to the virus (Ahola & Kääriäinen. 1995; Wang et al.. 1996). NSP4 was shown to have RNA polymerase activity. whereas the functions of NSP3 are less clear. NSP2 has several different functions including NTPase. helicase and protease activity (Kujala et al.. 1997).The aim of this project was to select ankyrin repeat (AR) proteins as intracellular viral inhibitors. Inhibition of NSP function by an AR protein inside the cell should inhibit viral replication. In analogy to the selection of APH inhibitors. our plan of action was to use ribosome display to select binders of the NSPs from AR protein libraries and to use these pools of binders for in vivo screens detecting individuals protecting cells from SFV.,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:3vbIHxFL9FgC,0,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/163269/1/20050003.pdf#page=141,,,,,0

AMPK senses the AMP level in the cell. not to be confused with cAMP. detecting stress to meet cellular energy demands (Kemp et al.. 1999). Low AMP levels. as found in exercising muscle. activate AMPK. After activation. energyproducing processes. such as for example glucose uptake and metabolism. are started. and energy consuming ones. such as fatty acid synthesis. transcription or apoptosis. are stopped. This central role in energy sensing might suggest AMPK as drug target (Ruderman & Prentki. 2004). AMPK activation might help patients with type 2 diabetes (Winder & Hardie. 1999). This disease shows symptoms. which would be predicted for decreased AMPK activity. In fact. indirect activation of AMPK by AICAR reduced glucose and insulin levels in the blood of test animals. This implies that AMPK activators could find therapeutic use. Inhibitors of AMPK are also of high interest. Tumor cells are known to have high metabolic activity and AMPK seems to contribute to tolerance of tumor cells to metabolic stress (Kato et al.. 2002). AMPK inhibition studies with RNAi indeed stopped tumor growth in mice.The aim of this project was to select AR proteins binding to AMPK by ribosome display. The selected pool of binders would be the starting point for inhibitor and activator screenings. AMPK is a heterotrimer. consisting of one α-. βand γ-subunit each.

A combined in vitro/in vivo selection approach. based on ribosome display and the protein fragment complementation assay (PCA) yielded a large number of different binders. fully functional in the bacterial cytoplasm. Only one round of ribosome display with subsequent small scale PCA selection was necessary to isolate a first specific binder. After two rounds of ribosome display selection. virtually all AR proteins identified by PCA showed specific binding. with affinities in the low nM range. The selected AR proteins specifically bound to JNK2. while they did not interact with the 81% identical JNK1. Taken together. the combination of ribosome display and PCA selections allowed the identification of large pools of binders at unparalleled speed.

Most paradigms of enzymology are the fruit of the first approach. the continuous search for new enzymes and their judicious study. This"" discovery"" approach has led not only to the characterization of enzymes catalyzing new reaction types. but also to the meticulous dissection of the simplest elementary~ catalytic steps. A second approach. the modification of one enzyme by chemical or. nowadays. mainly genetic means (ie. the perturbation of the catalytic machinery). has recently also begun to provide further insight into the mechanisms of catalysis (for review. see Leatherbarrow and Fersht 1986; Wetzel 1986; Knowles 1987). Most enzymes have probably evolved to a rather high efficiency. The consequence is that modification will. most probably. only reduce their activity or leave it unaffected when they are tested for the reaction and conditions for which they were intended by nature (Albery and Knowles 1977). The third approach to the study of catalysis involves the"" design"" of suitable (probably at first rather modest) catalytic entities. The presumption here is that this may provide a very sensitive test of the requirements for efficient catalytic rate enhancements.

Therapies that target EGFR can promote the dimerization of EGFR with other ErbB receptors. which is associated with the development of drug resistance. Understanding how interactions among ErbB receptors alter EGFR biology could provide avenues for improving cancer therapy. We found that EGFR interacted directly with the CYT1 and CYT2 variants of ErbB4 and the membrane-anchored intracellular domain (mICD). The CYT2 variant. but not the CYT1 variant. protected EGFR from ligand-induced degradation by competing with EGFR for binding to a complex containing the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl and the adaptor Grb2. Cultured breast cancer cells overexpressing both EGFR and ErbB4 CYT2 mICD exhibited increased migration. With molecular modeling. we identified residues involved in stabilizing the EGFR dimer. Mutation of these residues in the dimer interface destabilized the complex in cells and abrogated growth factor–stimulated cell migration. An exon array analysis of 155 breast tumors revealed that the relative mRNA abundance of the ErbB4 CYT2 variant was increased in ER+ HER2–breast cancer patients. suggesting that our findings could be clinically relevant.

59299,Examples with Engineered Antibodies,,Andreas Plückthun,,,,,,Directed molecular evolution is a powerful strategy for investigating the structure and function of proteins. When a function. such as ligand binding. can only be carried out by the native state of the protein. the biological selection for this function can be used to improve structural properties of the protein. Thus. thermodynamic stability and folding efficiency. which is the ability to avoid aggregation duringfolding. can be optimized. Three methods of selection are reviewed: phage display. selectively infective phages (SIP) and ribosome display. a cell-free method. Examples for optimizing antibody stability are discussed. In one case. antibodies have been generated under evolutionary pressure. which are stable in the absence of any disulfide bond. in the other case. a kink in the first strand of the beta-sandwich of kappa domains has been optimized.,True,yKyVJuQAAAAJ:jtI9f0ekYq0C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Plueckthun/publication/222104708_Studying_Protein_Structure_and_Function_by_Directed_Evolution/links/00b4951e7f372186cf000000.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Plueckthun/publication/222104708_Studying_Protein_Structure_and_Function_by_Directed_Evolution/links/00b4951e7f372186cf000000.pdf,0

The identification and improvement of the relevant ligand or receptor is therefore a focus of much of current biochemical research and the prerequisite for most pharmaceutical applications. Despite great progress. computational methods have generally not produced the accuracy required for “designing” mutations which improve a function such as binding or stability. Over the last few years. however. enormous progress in molecular biology has made it possible to imitate nature's strategy to solve the problem. the strategy of evolution.

Structure determination of GPCRs has still remained extremely challenging. and almost entirely a subject of trial and error with very low success rates. Previous data suggested that both the low expression level and instability of GPCRs might be attributed to the poor biophysical properties. ie. the particular amino acid sequence.Our laboratory has previously developed a directed evolution approach to solve the practical problem of generating more stable GPCRs [1. 2].

The TonB-dependant complex of Gram-negative bacteria is required to take up iron and vitamin B12 into the periplasm against their concentration gradients. For this purpose. TonB and its inner-membrane associated proteins ExbB and ExbD play the role of an energy-transducing complex. coupling the electrochemical proton gradient of the inner membrane to active processes across the outer membrane.We have solved the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of TonB from E. coli 1. and provide the first evidence that this region of TonB (residues 164-239) forms a tightly intertwined dimer.

Most commonly used for antibody display are vector systems of type 3+ 3 (1). leading to phages which carry both the wild-type gene3 protein (g3p) and g3 fusion protein. Thus. every single phage particle is infective. and the enrichment of useful molecules is dependent on washing and elution conditions. In contrast. the selectively infective phage (SIP)(2. 3) system is a phage display technology in which the infectivity of the phage particle is dependent on the occurrence of a cognate interaction between the protein of interest and a ligand. for example an antibody and an antigen. The phage particle itself is made non-infective by the replacement of its N-terminal domains of g3p with a ligand binding protein.

Binding of Wnts to the coreceptors Frizzled and LRP6/5 leads to phosphorylation of PPPSPxS motifs in the LRP6/5 intracellular region and the inhibition of GSK3β bound to the scaffold protein Axin. However. it remains unknown how GSK3β is specifically inhibited upon Wnt stimulation. Here. we show that overexpression of the intracellular region of LRP6 containing a Ser/Thr rich cluster and a PPPSPxS motif impairs the activity of GSK3β in cells. Synthetic peptides containing the PPPSPxS motif strongly inhibit GSK3β in vitro only when they are phosphorylated. Microinjection of these peptides into Xenopus embryos confirms that the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif potentiates Wnt-induced second body axis formation. In addition. we show that the Ser/Thr rich cluster of LRP6 plays an important role in LRP6 binding to GSK3β.

Unlike most kinases. GSK-3 is controlled by inhibition rather than by specific activation. In the insulin and several other signaling pathways. phosphorylation of a serine present in a conserved sequence near the amino terminus of GSK-3 generates an auto-inhibitory peptide. In contrast. Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction requires phosphorylation of Ser/Pro rich sequences present in the Wnt co-receptors LRP5/6. and these motifs inhibit GSK-3 activity. We present crystal structures of GSK-3 bound to its phosphorylated N-terminus and to two of the phosphorylated LRP6 motifs. A conserved loop unique to GSK-3 undergoes a dramatic conformational change that clamps the bound pseudo-substrate peptides. and reveals the mechanism of primed substrate recognition.

Conformational heterogeneity in the active site of the dynamic enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA) has been previously linked to its catalytic function. but the extent to which the different conformations of these residues are correlated is unclear. Here we compare the conformational ensembles of CypA by multitemperature synchrotron crystallography and fixed-target X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) crystallography. The diffraction-before-destruction nature of XFEL experiments provides a radiation-damage-free view of the functionally important alternative conformations of CypA. confirming earlier synchrotron-based results. We monitored the temperature dependences of these alternative conformations with eight synchrotron datasets spanning 100-310 K. Multiconformer models show that many alternative conformations in CypA are populated only at 240 K and above. yet others remain populated or become populated at 180 K and below. These results point to a complex evolution of conformational heterogeneity between 180-–240 K that involves both thermal deactivation and solvent-driven arrest of protein motions in the crystal. The lack of a single shared conformational response to temperature within the dynamic active-site network provides evidence for a conformation shuffling model. in which exchange between rotamer states of a large aromatic ring in the middle of the network shifts the conformational ensemble for the other residues in the network.

Structure‐based mutation of the TLE tetramer interface shows that dimers cannot mediate repression. even though they bind to TCFs with the same affinity as tetramers.

It has been concluded that cytosolic αE-catenin homodimer is not important for intercellular adhesion because E-cadherin/αE-catenin chimeras thought to mimic the CCC are sufficient to induce cell–cell adhesion. We show that. unlike αE-catenin in the CCC. these chimeras homodimerize. bind F-actin strongly. and inhibit the Arp2/3 complex. all of which are properties of the αE-catenin homodimer. To more accurately mimic the junctional CCC. we designed a constitutively monomeric chimera. and show that E-cadherin–dependent cell adhesion is weaker in cells expressing this chimera compared with cells in which αE-catenin homodimers are present.

Detailed analysis of LRP6 domain mutants identified Ser 243 in the first propeller domain of LRP6 as a critical residue for mAb135 binding. implicating this domain in regulating the sensitivity of LRP6 to DKK1.

The C-terminal region of DP (DPCT) mediates IF binding. and contains three plakin repeat domains (PRDs). termed PRD-A. PRD-B and PRD-C. Previous crystal structures of PRDs B and C revealed that each is formed by 4.5 copies of a plakin repeat (PR) and has a conserved positively charged groove on its surface. Although PRDs A and B are linked by just four amino acids. B and C are separated by a 154 residue flexible linker. which has hindered crystallographic analysis of the full DPCT. Here we present the crystal structure of a DPCT fragment spanning PRDs A and B. and elucidate the overall architecture of DPCT by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis. The structure of PRD-A is similar to that of PRD-B. and the two domains are arranged in a quasi-linear arrangement. and separated by a 4 amino acid linker. Analysis of the B-C linker region using secondary structure prediction and the crystal structure of a homologous linker from the cytolinker periplakin suggests that the N-terminal ~100 amino acids of the linker form two PR-like motifs. SAXS analysis of DPCT indicates an elongated but non-linear shape with Rg = 51.5 Å and Dmax = 178 Å.

These highly dynamic multi-protein complexes reach from the cytoplasm through the cell membrane to the outside of the cell. Linking intercellular adhesion proteins to the cytoskeleton enables. for example. remodelling of epithelial sheets during development. Similarly. cell migration depends on coordinating adhesion to the extracellular matrix with changes in actin polymerization.

Wnt binding to its coreceptors activates the cytosolic effector Dishevelled (Dvl). leading to the recruitment of Axin and the inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation. This process requires interaction of homologous DIX domains present in Dvl and Axin. but is mechanistically undefined. We show that Dvl DIX forms antiparallel. double-stranded oligomers in vitro. and that Dvl in cells forms oligomers typically <10 molecules at endogenous expression levels. Axin DIX (DAX) forms small single-stranded oligomers. but its self-association is stronger than that of DIX. DAX caps the ends of DIX oligomers. such that a DIX oligomer has at most four DAX binding sites.

D.DegreeYear: 1988Institute: Harvard UniversityThe 3-dimensional structures of influenza virus hemagglutinins complexed with sialosaccharide analogues of the influenza cellular receptor have been determined to 3 A resolution. using X-ray crystallographic isomorphous difference Fourier analysis and refinement. Sialic acid binds to a pocket of conserved residues that is surrounded by variable antibody binding sites. The structures show that the conserved residues interact with unique features of sialic acids. The interactions deduced from the X-ray analysis suggest approaches to the design of anti-viral agents that would bind to the receptor binding site and block attachment of the virus to host cells.,True,pbkgvawAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC,2,https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=5949772,11733904724478665677,/scholar?cites=11733904724478665677,,,0

59518,The C-terminal domain of talin forms a force-responsive. directional catch bond to F-actin,2020,Leanna M Owen and Nicolas A Bax and William I Weis and Alexander R Dunn,118,Biophysical Journal,3,31a,Elsevier,Integrin-based adhesion complexes are dynamic regulators of force transduction between the actomyosin cytoskeleton and the surrounding extracellular matrix. The linkage between integrins and filamentous actin is largely mediated by talin. a 270 KDa adapter protein that also recruits additional actin-binding proteins to assemble the focal adhesion. Force transmission through talin is thought to be initiated by F-actin binding to talin's C-terminal actin binding site (ABS3). Although ABS3 has been characterized in bulk biochemical and cell biological assays. very little is known about how it binds to F-actin under load. We used a single-molecule optical trap assay to study the force-dependent kinetics ABS3 from talin 1 binding to F-actin.

59519,The C-terminal actin binding domain of talin forms an asymmetric catch bond with F-actin,2020,Leanna M Owen and Nicolas A Bax and William Weis and Alexander R Dunn,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Focal adhesions (FAs) are large. integrin-based adhesion complexes that link cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Previous work demonstrates that FAs form only when and where they are necessary to transmit force between the cellular cytoskeleton and the ECM. but how this occurs remains poorly understood. Talin is a 270 kDa adapter protein that links integrins to filamentous (F)-actin and recruits additional components during FA assembly in a force-dependent manner. Cell biological and developmental data demonstrate that the third. and C-terminal. F-actin binding site (ABS3) of talin is required for normal FA formation. However. ABS3 binds F-actin only weakly in in vitro. biochemical assays. We used a single-molecule optical trap assay to examine how and whether ABS3 binds F-actin under physiologically relevant. pN mechanical loads. We find that ABS3 forms a directional catch bond with F-actin when force is applied towards the pointed end of the actin filament. with binding lifetimes more than 100-fold longer than when force is applied towards the barbed end. Long-lived bonds to F-actin under load require the ABS3 C-terminal dimerization domain. whose cleavage is known to regulate focal adhesion turnover. Our results support a mechanism in which talin ABS3 preferentially binds and orients actin filaments with barbed ends facing the cell periphery. thus nucleating long-range order in the actin cytoskeleton. We suggest that talin ABS3 may function as a molecular AND gate that allows FA growth only when sufficient integrin density.

At present. data acquisition suffers from low throughput. in part due to the low probability of positioning a cell such that the subcellular structure of interest is on a region of the electron microscopy (EM) grid that is suitable for imaging. Here. we leverage photo-micropatterning of EM grids to optimally position endothelial cells to enable high-throughput imaging of cell-cell contacts.  This method increases the distance between contacts and the thicker cell nuclei such that the regions of interest are sufficiently thin for imaging.

While vinculin is thought to reinforce the cadherin-catenin/actin linkage. the mechanistic details of this process remain poorly understood. Although the actin-binding activity of vinculin likely contributes to junctional strengthening. we find that that complex formation with an αE-catenin binding domain from vinculin led to longer-lived actin binding. but in a manner that was enhanced under force.

Moreover. the crystal is stationary during the femtosecond pulse. so reflections are generally only partially recorded. Therefore. each XFEL diffraction image must be scaled individually and. ideally. corrected for partiality prior to merging.

However. how mechanical load affects the vinculin-F-actin bond is unclear. Using a single-molecule optical trap assay. we found that vinculin forms a force-dependent catch bond with F-actin through its tail domain. but with lifetimes that depend strongly on the direction of the applied force. Force toward the pointed (-) end of the actin filament resulted in a bond that was maximally stable at 8 pN. with a mean lifetime (12 sec) 10 times as long as the mean lifetime when force was applied toward the barbed (+) end. A computational model of actin dynamics near adhesions suggests that the directionality of the vinculin-F-actin bond can potentially establish long-range order in the actin cytoskeleton through a polarity-sorting effect. one that may reinforce persistent cell migration.

HMP-1 shares overall similarity in structure and actinbinding properties. but displayed differences in conformational flexibility and allosteric regulation from mammalian α-catenin. HMP-1 bound filamentous actin with an affinity in the single micromolar range. even when complexed with the β-catenin homolog HMP-2 or when present in a complex of HMP-2 and the cadherin homolog HMR-1. indicating that HMP-1 binding to F-actin is not allosterically regulated by the HMP-2–HMR-1 complex. The middle (ie. M) domain of HMP-1 appeared to be less conformationally flexible than mammalian α-catenin. which may underlie the dampened effect of HMP-2 binding on HMP-1 actin-binding activity compared with that of the mammalian homolog. In conclusion. our data indicate that HMP-1 constitutively binds β-catenin and F-actin …,True,pbkgvawAAAAJ:GFxP56DSvIMC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kyeong_Jin/publication/315119926_Structural_and_Functional_Characterization_of_Caenorhabditis_elegans_a-Catenin_Reveals_Constitutive_Binding_to_b-Catenin_and_F-actin/links/5b50a7e1aca27217ffa63725/Structural-and-Functional-Characterization-of-Caenorhabditis-elegans-a-Catenin-Reveals-Constitutive-Binding-to-b-Catenin-and-F-actin.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kyeong_Jin/publication/315119926_Structural_and_Functional_Characterization_of_Caenorhabditis_elegans_a-Catenin_Reveals_Constitutive_Binding_to_b-Catenin_and_F-actin/links/5b50a7e1aca27217ffa63725/Structural-and-Functional-Characterization-of-Caenorhabditis-elegans-a-Catenin-Reveals-Constitutive-Binding-to-b-Catenin-and-F-actin.pdf,0

This “homotypic” cell sorting behavior led to the idea that cadherin molecules of one subtype bind to other molecules of the same subtype but not to cadherins of a different subtype. A classic example occurs during the process of neurulation in vertebrates (Radice et al. 1997). The separation of the neural tube from the embryonic ectoderm layer is mediated in part by expression changes in two cadherins. E-and N-cadherin. Cells of the early ectoderm layer express E-cadherin. and thus adhere together homotypically to form an epithelial cell layer. Some of these cells then “switch” from expression of E-cadherin to expression of N-cadherin. These N-cadherin expressing cells. with their different adhesive properties. are thus displaced from the E-cadherin containing ectoderm to form a new cell layer. which adheres together homotypically via N-cadherin to form the presumptive neural tube (see also Stepniak et al. 2009). The early notion that cadherin binding preferences are exclusively homophilic is not entirely correct. In vitro experiments that examined sorting of cadherin-transfected cells (Volk et al. 1987; Shimoyama et al. 2000; Duguay et al. 2003; Patel et al. 2006) and binding of such cellsCadherin …,True,pbkgvawAAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12061451012468628856&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

59571,Two Crystal Structures of the beta2‐Adrenergic Receptor,2009,William I Weis,23,The FASEB Journal,,330.2-330.2,Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome. and are responsible for the majority of signal transduction events involving hormones and neurotransmitters across the cell membrane. GPCRs that bind to diffusible ligands have low natural abundance. are relatively unstable in detergents. and display basal G protein activation even in the absence of ligands. To overcome these problems two approaches were taken to obtain crystal structures of the β2‐adrenergic receptor (β2AR). a well‐characterized GPCR that binds catecholamine hormones. The receptor was bound to the partial inverse agonist carazolol and co‐crystallized with a Fab made to a three‐dimensional epitope formed by the third intracellular loop (ICL3). or by replacement of ICL3 with T4 lysozyme.

In adherens junctions. the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins is functionally linked to the actin cytoskeleton through a series of proteins known as catenins. E-cadherin binds to β-catenin. which in turn binds to α-catenin to form a ternary complex. α-Catenin also binds to actin. and it was assumed previously that α-catenin links the cadherin–catenin complex to actin. However. biochemical. structural and live-cell imaging studies of the cadherin–catenin complex and its interaction with actin show that binding of β-catenin to α-catenin prevents the latter from binding to actin. Biochemical and structural data indicate that α-catenin acts as an allosteric protein whose conformation and activity changes depending on whether or not it is bound to β-catenin. Initial contacts between cells occur on dynamic lamellipodia formed by polymerization of branched actin networks. a process controlled by the Arp2/3 (actin-related protein 2/3) complex. α-Catenin can suppress the activity of Arp2/3 by competing for actin filaments. These findings lead to a model for adherens junction formation in which clustering of the cadherin–β-catenin complex recruits high levels of α-catenin that can suppress the Arp2/3 complex. leading to cessation of lamellipodial movement and formation of a stable contact. Thus α-catenin appears to play a central role in cell–cell contact formation.,True,pbkgvawAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b8dd/333f825837ebb9f0e2983fa59af6efb59901.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b8dd/333f825837ebb9f0e2983fa59af6efb59901.pdf,0

59584,Orientation of Bound Ligands in Mannose-binding Proteins,2002,K-S Ng Kenneth and Anand R Kolatkar and Shaun Park-Snyder and Hadar Feinberg and Damon A Clark and Kurt Drickamer and William I Weis,,,,,,Mannose-binding proteins (MBPs) are C-type animal lectins that recognize high mannose oligosaccharides on pathogenic cell surfaces. MBPs bind to their carbohydrate ligands by forming a series of Ca2 coordination and hydrogen bonds with two hydroxyl groups equivalent to the 3-and 4-OH of mannose. In this work. the determinants of the orientation of sugars bound to rat serum and liver MBPs (MBP-A and MBP-C) have been systematically investigated. The crystal structures of MBP-A soaked with monosaccharides and disaccharides and also the structure of the MBP-A trimer cross-linked by a high mannose asparaginyl oligosaccharide reveal that monosaccharides or 1–6-linked mannose bind to MBP-A in one orientation. whereas 1–2-or 1–3-linked mannose binds in an orientation rotated 180 around a local symmetry axis relating the 3-and 4-OH groups. In contrast. a similar set of ligands all bind to MBP-C in a single orientation. The mutation of MBP-A His189 to its MBP-C equivalent. valine. causes Man 1–3Man to bind in a mixture of orientations. These data combined with modeling indicate that the residue at this position influences the orientation of bound ligands in MBP. We propose that the control of binding orientation can influence the recognition of multivalent ligands. A lateral association of trimers in the cross-linked crystals may reflect interactions within higher oligomers of MBP-A that are stabilized by multivalent ligands.,True,pbkgvawAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Damon_Clark/publication/11511802_Orientation_of_bound_ligands_in_mannose-binding_proteins_-_Implications_for_multivalent_ligand_recognition/links/5829c5f208ae11c677f0355c/Orientation-of-bound-ligands-in-mannose-binding-proteins-Implications-for-multivalent-ligand-recognition.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Damon_Clark/publication/11511802_Orientation_of_bound_ligands_in_mannose-binding_proteins_-_Implications_for_multivalent_ligand_recognition/links/5829c5f208ae11c677f0355c/Orientation-of-bound-ligands-in-mannose-binding-proteins-Implications-for-multivalent-ligand-recognition.pdf,0

Examples include bacterial toxins; animal receptors that mediate cellcell interactions. uptake of glycoconjugates. and pathogen neutralization; and plant toxins and mitogens. The structural basis for selective sugar recognition by members of all of these groups has been investigated by x-ray crystallography. Mechanisms for sugar recognition have evolved independently in diverse protein structural frameworks. but share some key features. Relatively low affinity binding sites for monosaccharides are formed at shallow indentations on protein surfaces. Selectivity is achieved through a combination of hydrogen bonding to the sugar hydroxyl groups with van der Waals packing. often including packing of a hydrophobic sugar face against aromatic amino acid side chains.

However. deregulation of this pathway can initiate and promote human malignancies. especially of the colon and head and neck. Therefore. Wnt/b-catenin signaling represents an attractive target for cancer therapy. We performed high-throughput screening using AlphaScreen and ELISA techniques to identify small molecules that disrupt the critical interaction between b-catenin and the transcription factor TCF4 required for signal transduction. We found that compound LF3. a 4-thioureido-benzenesulfonamide derivative. robustly inhibited this interaction.

The underlying concept is that the x-ray pulses are so intense that the imaging process is outrunning the sample damage2. First single particle imaging (SPI) experiments performed at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) have been very successful. producing single-shot coherent diffraction images of viruses3. bacteriophages4. organelles5. and cyanobacteria6 to name a few. A variety of other biological structures have been imaged with the goal of creating data sets for algorithm development4. First steps have been taken to assemble single shot images into three dimensional data sets7. In addition to biological systems. single shot diffractive imaging has been used to study the morphology of aerosols8. 9. power density dependent damage processes in atomic clusters10. and superfluid quantum systems11. The resolution of single-shot single-particle imaging experiments at LCLS has so far been limited to a few tens of nanometers. To unlock the full potential of imaging experiments with free-electron lasers. including the ability to perform time-resolved studies. atomic resolution needs to be achieved. But currently it is not clear if atomic resolution from single particles can be reached and if so. which technical and scientific problems have to be solved. In this spirit LCLS has hosted a by-invitation workshop with renowned experts in the field of ultrafast radiation damage. imaging algorithm development. XFEL instrumentation. and sample issues.

59612,A Novel Mechanism for Binding of Galactose-terminated Glycans by the C-type Carbohydrate Recognition Domain in Blood Dendritic Cell Antigen 2,,K Drickamer and SAF Jégouzo and H Feinberg and T Dungarwalla and William I Weis and Maureen E Taylor,,,,,American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Background: BDCA-2 is an anti-inflammatory receptor uniquely expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Results: Glycan arrays and x-ray structural analysis have been used to define the mechanism of sugar binding to BDCA-2. Conclusion: BDCA-2 binds selectively to glycans containing the epitope Galß1–3/4GlcNAcß1–2Man. Significance: Binding of BDCA-2 to unusual galactose-terminated glycans on IgG or other serum glycoproteins provides a potential mechanism for modulating the immune response.Blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA-2; also designated CLEC4C or CD303) is uniquely expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Stimulation of BDCA-2 with antibodies leads to an anti-inflammatory response in these cells. but the natural ligands for the receptor are not known. The C-type carbohydrate recognition domain in the extracellular portion of BDCA-2 contains a signature motif typical of C-type animal lectins that bind mannose. glucose. or GlcNAc. yet it has been reported that BDCA-2 binds selectively to galactose-terminated. biantennary N-linked glycans. A combination of glycan array analysis and binding competition studies with monosaccharides and natural and synthetic oligosaccharides have been used to define the binding epitope for BDCA-2 as the trisaccharide Gal 1–3/4GlcNAc 1–2Man. X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis studies show that mannose is ligated to the conserved Ca2 in the primary binding site that is characteristic of C-type carbohydrate recognition domains. and the GlcNAc and galactose residues make additional interactions in a wide. shallow groove adjacent to the primary binding site.

N2O emissions after midseason drainage depended strongly on whether or not fields were waterlogged due to intermittent irrigation.

Here we develop a method to estimate haplotypes from low-coverage sequencing data that can take advantage of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotypes on the same samples. First the SNP array data are phased to build a backbone (or ‘scaffold’) of haplotypes across each chromosome. We then phase the sequence data ‘onto’this haplotype scaffold. This approach can take advantage of relatedness between sequenced and non-sequenced samples to improve accuracy.

Here. we tested the hypothesis that auxin transport is involved in mediating ABA's modulation by activating proton secretion in the root tip to maintain root growth under moderate water stress. Rice and Arabidopsis plants were raised under a hydroponic system and subjected to moderate water stress (−0.47 MPa) with polyethylene glycol (PEG). ABA accumulation. auxin transport and plasma membrane H+‐ATPase activity at the root tip were monitored in addition to the primary root elongation and root hair density. We found that moderate water stress increases ABA accumulation and auxin transport in the root apex. Additionally. ABA modulation is involved in the regulation of auxin transport in the root tip.

However. the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. The present study shows that the activity of MORs can be enhanced by preventing MORs from DOR-mediated codegradation. Treatment with DOR-specific agonists led to endocytosis of both DORs and MORs. These receptors were further processed for ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. resulting in a reduction of surface MORs. Such effects were attenuated by treatment with an interfering peptide containing the first transmembrane domain of MOR (MORTM1). which interacted with DORs and disrupted the MOR/DOR interaction.

Daily injections of fluoxetine(10 mg/kg/day) for 0. 3. 7. 14 or 22 days gradually produced a shift to the right in the dose-response curve effects of 8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) on plasma adrenal corticotropic hormone. corti-costerone and oxytocin. A partial reduction was observed for the adrenal corticotropic hormone and oxytocin responses to 8-OH-DPAT(50 pg/kg sc) after 3 days. and a maximum reduction of all hormone responses was observed after 14 days of fluoxetine injections. when the adrenal corticotropic hormone and oxytocin responses to the 50-tg/kg dose of 8-OHDPAT were virtually blocked.

This paper reviews the latest development in multidisciplinary TP research associated with this warming. The rapid warming facilitates intense and broad glacier melt over most of the TP. although some glaciers in the northwest are advancing. By heating the atmosphere and reducing snow/ice albedo. aerosols also contribute to the glaciers melting. Glacier melt is accompanied by lake expansion and intensification of the water cycle over the TP. Precipitation has increased over the eastern and northwestern TP. Meanwhile. the TP is greening and most regions are experiencing advancing phenological trends. although over the southwest there is a spring phenological delay mainly in response to the recent decline in spring precipitation.

Here. we report the finished and annotated genome sequence of M. bovis strain Hubei-1. a strain isolated in 2008 that caused calf pneumonia on a Chinese farm. The genome of M. bovis strain Hubei-1 contains a single circular chromosome of 953.114 bp with a 29.37% GC content. We identified 803 open reading frames (ORFs) that occupy 89.5% of the genome.

In this study. we cloned. expressed and purified recombinant M. bovis α-enolase and induced polyclonal anti-α-enolase antibodies in rabbits. M. bovis α-enolase was detected in the cytoplasmic and membrane protein fractions by these antibodies. Triple immunofluorescence labeling combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed that the plasminogen (Plg) enhanced the adherence of M. bovis to embryonic bovine lung (EBL) cells; the values obtained for adherence and inhibition are consistent with this finding.

In this review. the four solutions to reduce the consumption of thiosulfate. including the control of reaction conditions. the use of additives. the generation of thiosulfate in situ. and the replacement of traditional cupric-ammonia catalysis. are introduced and evaluated after the presentation of background knowledge about thiosulfate consumption. The replacement of cupric-ammonia catalysis with other metals. such as nickel-and cobalt-based catalysts. is proposed. The reason is that it not only reduces thiosulfate consumption observably via decreasing the redox potential of leach solution significantly but also is beneficial to gold recovery mainly owing to eliminating the interference of cuprous thiosulfate [Cu (S 2 O 3) 3] 5−. Based on the comparative analysis for five common recovery techniques of rare-noble metals from pregnant leach solution. ion-exchange resin adsorption is considered to be the most appropriate to recover aurothiosulfate [Au (S 2 O 3) 2] 3− because the resin can be employed in the form of resin-in-leach/pulp and. furthermore. is able to be eluted and regenerated simultaneously at ambient temperature. At last. how to reduce the process cost of the resin adsorption technique is discussed.

We examined alterations in anxiety-like behaviors after manipulation of the expression of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors in the amygdala using recombinant adenovirus approaches. Recombinant adenoviruses containing a 5-HT1A promoter-controlled 5-HT1A antisense sequence or a 5-HT2C promoter-controlled 5-HT2C sense sequence were injected into the amygdala. Elevated plus-maze (EPM) and open field tests were conducted to determine anxiety-like behavior and locomotor activity.

To mitigate the downlink interference from femtocell base stations (FBSs) to nearby macrocell users (MUEs). power control is employed to enable FBSs to dynamically reconfigure their power allocation based on information obtained from information exchange between macrocell and femtocells. However. lack of direct coordination between macrocell and femtocell networks makes cognitive radio (CR) a promising solution to interference management of two-tier networks. In this paper we address the problem of power control in the two-tier network and propose an optimal CR-based power control scheme. Equipped with the ability of spectrum sensing. FBSs can obtain necessary information such as the downlink radio resource usage of macrocell and information about nearby MUEs.

Angiogenesis mediated by VEGF gene expression and its modification through histone acetylation has been considered a target in treating myocardial ischemia. This study aims to exam whether modulation of angiogenesis through H3K9 acetylation regulation at VEGF gene is one possible cardioprotective mechanism of acupuncture.  Results We generated rat MI models by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery and applied electroacupuncture (EA) treatment at the Neiguan (PC6) acupoint. Our results showed that acupuncture reversed the S-T segment change. reduced Q-wave area. decreased CK. CK-MB. LDH levels. mitigated myocardial remodeling. and promoted microvessel formation in the MI heart. RNA-seq analysis showed that VEGF-induced angiogenesis signaling was involved in the modulation of EA. Western blot results verified that the protein expressions of VEGF. Ras. phospho-p44/42 MAPK. phospho-p38 MAPK. phospho-SAPK/JNK and Akt. were all elevated significantly by EA treatment in the MI heart. Furthermore. increased H3K9 acetylation was also observed according with the VEGF. ChIP assay confirmed that EA treatment could notably stimulate the recruitment of H3K9ace at the VEGF promoter.

However. GM(1. 1) is only a first order single variable grey model. the forecasted accuracy is unsatisfactory when original data show great randomness. In this paper. we propose improved grey dynamic model GM(2. 1). a second order single variable grey model. to enhance the forecasted accuracy. Then it is applied to improve STLF performance. We provide a viewpoint that the derivative and background value of GM(2. 1) model can be expressed in grey number. Then cubic spline function is presented to calculate the derivative and background value in grey number interval. We call the proposed model as 3spGM(2. 1) model. Additionally.

59775,Particulate air pollution and hospitalization for asthma.,1992,RY Tseng and Chi Kit Li and JA Spinks,68,Annals of allergy,5,425-432,,Age-specific quarterly asthmatic hospital discharge rates in Hong Kong during 1983 to 1989 were examined in relation to mean levels of six pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO2). ozone (O3). total suspended particles (TSP). respiratory suspended particles (RSP). nitrogen dioxide (NO2). and nitrogen oxides (NOX). Discharges from the hospital of children under 14 years of age represented 56% of 33.952 discharges recorded in all age groups. Trends of adult hospitalization rates over time remained stable during the study period. In children. however. there was an increase in these rates. particularly marked in the age group of 1 to 4 years. Univariate analysis revealed a strong correlation between quarterly mean TSP and hospital discharge rate for the 1 to 4-year-old children (r=. 62. P less than. 001). In the 5 to 14-year-old age group. there was an inverse relationship between hospital discharge rate and sulfur dioxide level (r=-. 38. P less than. 05). Stepwise multiple regression analysis. controlling for confounding variables (seasonal and annual trends of asthma hospitalizations) confirmed these relationships. A highly significant linear regression equation was derived between hospitalization rate for ages 1 to 4 years and total suspended particles (P less than. 001). The highly significant correlation between pollution and asthmatic hospitalization rate for the 1 to 4-year-old group suggests that young children are vulnerable to the adverse environmental effects of pollution.

It is necessary to identify biomarkers to predict chemosensitivity and avoid over-treatment. We hypothesized that miRNAs in the serum might be associated with chemosensitivity.  Methods Sixty-eight breast cancer patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin plus paclitaxel. The serum of the patients was collected before chemotherapy and stored at −80°C. The samples were classified into two groups in term of the chemosensitivity. We identified the differential expression patterns of miRNAs between the chemotherapy sensitive and resistant groups using microRNA profiling. Four miRNAs that were differentially expressed between the two groups were further validated in another 56 samples. We created a model fitting formula and a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve using logistic regression analysis to evaluate the prediction potency.  Results We identified 8 miRNAs differentially expressed between the two groups: 6 miRNAs were up-regulated. and 2 miRNAs were down-regulated in the resistant group compared with the sensitive group. The expression of miR-19a and miR-205 were determined to have significant differences between the two groups (P<0.05). A predictive model of these two miRNAs was created by the logistic regression analysis. The probability of this model was 89.71%.

A central premise for the validity of this novel pathway is the absence of GRP in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. To this end. they showed that Grp mRNA in DRG neurons is either absent or barely detectable and claimed that BNP but not GRP is a major neurotransmitter for itch in pruriceptors.

NOx is stored on both perovskite and carbonate. and the formed nitrate on the perovskite can be transferred to the neighboring carbonates to regenerate the storage sites on the perovskite. During the sulfation process. both perovskite and carbonate can be sulfated. and the sulfate species formed on the former one is more easily reduced. The poison of the perovskite catalyst is mainly due to the sulfation of the carbonate. The NOx storage capacity of the sulfated BaFeO3-950 catalyst. on which a trace amount of carbonate exists. drops only 14% comparing with the fresh catalyst.

Persistent errors in the mouse genetic map have negatively affected QTL localization. spurring the development of a new. corrected map. In this study. QTLs for BMD were remapped in 11 archival mouse data sets using this new genetic map. Since these QTLs all were mapped in a comparable way. direct comparisons of QTLs for concordance would be valid. We then compared human genome‐wide association study (GWAS) BMD loci with the mouse QTLs. We found that 26 of the 28 human GWAS loci examined were located within the confidence interval of a mouse QTL. Furthermore. 14 of the GWAS loci mapped to within 3 cM of a mouse QTL peak. Lastly. we demonstrated that these newly remapped mouse QTLs can …,True,f5RIwvMAAAAJ:MOzItdknnOoC,57,https://asbmr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jbmr.72,3473717410031361798,/scholar?cites=3473717410031361798,,https://asbmr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jbmr.72,0

Both 1-D and 2-D versions of the kp-Ritz approach are formulated for conical panels. For conical panels with two simply supported straight edges. the 1-D kp-Ritz version is used. where the kernel particle estimation is employed in hybridized form with harmonic functions to approximate the 2-D displacement field. For conical panels having arbitrary boundary conditions. the displacement field is approximated by the 2-D kp-Ritz version. with 2-D form of kernel particle functions employed. The classical thin shell theory based on Love's hypothesis is employed in the present analyses. and based on the kernel particle concept and Ritz technique. the eigenequations of the frequencies of the conical panels are obtained.

The serotonergic stimulus consisted of injection of the 5-HT-releasing drug p-chloroamphetamine (8 mg/ kg. IP). The validity of this approach was verified by comparing this drug with another 5-HT releaser. d-fenfluramins (5 mg/kg. IP). Both 5-HT releasers increased plasma oxytocin concentration. Furthermore. the 5-HT uptake blocker fluoxetine (10 mg/ kg. IP) blocked the effects of both p-chloroamphetamine and d-fenfluramine on plasma oxytocin concentrations. suggesting that both 5-HT releasers must be taken up through the 5-HT transporter into 5-HT nerve terminals to increase oxytocin secretion.

OBSL1. and CCDC8 genes are mutated in a mutually exclusive manner in 3M and other growth retardation syndromes. The mechanism underlying the function of the three 3M genes in development is not known. We found that OBSL1 and CCDC8 form a complex with CUL7 and regulate the level and centrosomal localization of CUL7. respectively. CUL7 depletion results in altered microtubule dynamics. prometaphase arrest. tetraploidy. and mitotic cell death. These defects are recaptured in CUL7 mutated 3M cells and can be rescued by wild-type. but not by 3M patient-derived CUL7 mutants. Depletion of either OBSL1 or CCDC8 results in defects and sensitizes cells to microtubule damage similarly to loss of CUL7 function.

CeO 2 and ZrO 2) was studied to clarify the active sites and discover unified reaction intermediates in this typical gas-solid-solid catalytic reaction. The catalytically active sites were identified as free K+ rather than K 2 CO 3. which can activate gaseous oxygen. The active oxygen spills over to soot and forms a common intermediate. ketene. before it was further oxidized into the end product CO 2. The existence of ketene species was confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The oxygen spillover mechanism is proposed. which is explained as an electron transfer from soot to gaseous oxygen through the active K+ sites.

A total of 100 ADHD children (45 with family history of ADHD and 55 with no family history) and 100 healthy controls. all medication free. were tested on tasks related to the ‘hot’(ie two choice-delay tasks) and ‘cool’domains of EF (ie Digits backward. Corsi Block Task backward. Go/No-Go Task. Stop-Signal Task. and the Stroop).Results. Compared with the controls. children with ADHD were found to perform significantly worse on one or more measures of response inhibition. WM. and delay aversion after controlling for co-morbidities and estimated IQ. In addition. comparisons between ADHD children with family history of ADHD and those with no family history found significant differences on measures of response inhibition and WM but not delay aversion. These results are largely supported by results of two logistic regressions.Conclusions. ADHD was found to be associated with deficits on both cool and hot EFs. There is also evidence to suggest that cool EFs impairment is related to a family history of ADHD. Findings of this study have helped to elucidate the nature and extent of EF deficits in children with ADHD.,True,f5RIwvMAAAAJ:vnCYxJoEvCUC,48,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7f7a/130ae8157b1094f3597f67cb5d4733d0b184.pdf,4655745695810545589,/scholar?cites=4655745695810545589,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7f7a/130ae8157b1094f3597f67cb5d4733d0b184.pdf,0

However. certain natural products have been revealed as effective therapeutic agents for the management of pain states. In this study. we used the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) pain model to investigate the antinociceptive effect of triptolide (T10). a major active component of the traditional Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. Intrathecal T10 inhibited the mechanical nociceptive response induced by SNL without interfering with motor performance. Additionally. the anti-nociceptive effect of T10 was associated with the inhibition of the activation of spinal astrocytes. Furthermore.  intrathecal administration of T10 attenuated SNL-induced janus kinase (JAK) signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling pathway activation and inhibited the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. such as interleukin-6. interleukin-1 beta. and tumour necrosis factor-α. in dorsal horn astrocytes. Moreover. NR2B-containing spinal N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) was subsequently inhibited. Above all. T10 can alleviate SNL-induced NP via inhibiting the neuroinflammation in the spinal dorsal horn.

59861,Transient gastric irritation in the neonatal rats leads to changes in hypothalamic CRF expression. depression-and anxiety-like behavior as adults,2011,Liansheng Liu and Qian Li and Robert Sapolsky and Min Liao and Kshama Mehta and Aditi Bhargava and Pankaj J Pasricha,6,PloS one,5,e19498,Public Library of Science,Aims A disturbance of the brain-gut axis is a prominent feature in functional bowel disorders (such as irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia) and psychological abnormalities are often implicated in their pathogenesis. We hypothesized that psychological morbidity in these conditions may result from gastrointestinal problems. rather than causing them.   Methods Functional dyspepsia was induced by neonatal gastric irritation in male rats. 10-day old male Sprague-Dawley rats received 0.1% iodoacetamide (IA) or vehicle by oral gavage for 6 days. At 8–10 weeks of age. rats were tested with sucrose preference and forced-swimming tests to examine depression-like behavior. Elevated plus maze. open field and light-dark box tests were used to test anxiety-like behaviors. ACTH and corticosterone responses to a minor stressor. saline injection. and hypothalamic CRF expression were also measured.   Results Behavioral tests revealed changes of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in IA-treated. but not control rats. As compared with controls. hypothalamic and amygdaloid CRF immunoreactivity. basal levels of plasma corticosterone and stress-induced ACTH were significantly higher in IA-treated rats. Gastric sensory ablation with resiniferatoxin had no effect on behaviors but treatment with CRF type 1 receptor antagonist. antalarmin. reversed the depression-like behavior in IA-treated rats   Conclusions The present results suggest that transient gastric irritation in the neonatal period can induce a long lasting increase in depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. increased expression of CRF in the hypothalamus. and an increased …,True,f5RIwvMAAAAJ:kIrcBpI4azkC,46,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019498,7617302544699168900,/scholar?cites=7617302544699168900,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019498,0

The lncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) is reported to be an oncogene in a variety of cancers. However. the roles of PVT1-5 and its related miRNAs in lung cancer are poorly understood. In this study. we found that PVT1-5 expression was significantly increased in lung cancer tissues and cell lines. By using biotin-labeled lncRNA-PVT1-5 probe for miRNA in vivo precipitation (miRIP) in lung cancer cells and dual-luciferase reporterassays. we identified that miR-126 was associated with lncRNA-PVT1-5. Furthermore. knockdown of lncRNA-PVT1-5 in cells could down-regulate the expression of SLC7A5. the target of oncogenic miR-126. resulting in the cell proliferation.

The product showed a photocurrent density of 0.39 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs RHE. It was found that the Ti doping had promoted the photovoltage of hematite by surface modification rather than increasing donor density. The loading of Ni(OH)2 had further improved the photoelectrochemical performance of Ti-Fe2O3 via reducing both overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction and the recombination rate of the charge carriers.

Plasma membrane H+-ATPase (PM H+-ATPase) plays an important role in the plant response to low-phosphorus stress (LP). However. few details are known regarding the action of PM H+-ATPase in mediating root proton (H+) flux and root growth under LP. In this study. we investigated the involvement and function of different Arabidopsis PM H+-ATPase genes in root H+ flux in response to LP.

In this study. we firstly studied how this mechanism contributes to miR-375 downregulation in cervical cancer cells. Then. we further studied the association between miR-375 and MALAT1 (metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the cancer cells. HPV-16 positive SiHa and CaSki cells were used as in vitro model. Our data showed that HPV-16 E6 positively modulated DNMT1 expression in both SiHa and CaSki cells. Knockdown of DNMT1 partly restored miR-375 levels in the cells. The following methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assay and qRT-PCR analysis showed that methylation was common in the promoter region of miR-375 in both SiHa and CaSki cells and demethylation partly restored miR-375 levels in the cells. Therefore. we infer that miR-375 is downregulated partly due to promoter hypermethylation mediated by DNMT1 in HPV-16 positive cervical cancer cells. Our bioinformatics analysis showed that MALAT1 has three putative binding sites with miR-375 and the following dual luciferase assay confirmed two of them. QRT-PCR analysis showed that miR-375 overexpression significantly reduced MALAT1 expression. while MALAT1 overexpression reversely suppressed miR-375 levels. Therefore. we infer that there is a reciprocal regulation between miR-375 and MALAT1 in the cells. In SiHa cells. miR-375 overexpression or MALAT1 siRNA partly restored E-cadherin expression. significantly reduced N-cadherin and also reduced invasion capacity of SiHa cells.

However. exactly how FOXA1 achieves these remarkable biological functions is not fully understood. Here we report that FOXA1 associates with DNA repair complexes and is required for genomic targeting of DNA polymerase β (POLB) in human cells. Genome-wide DNA methylomes demonstrate that the FOXA1 DNA repair complex is functionally linked to DNA demethylation in a lineage-specific fashion. Depletion of FOXA1 results in localized reestablishment of methylation in a large portion of FOXA1-bound regions. and the regions with the most consistent hypermethylation exhibit the greatest loss of POLB and are represented by active promoters and enhancers. Consistently. overexpression of FOXA1 commits its binding sites to active DNA demethylation in a POLB-dependent manner. Finally.

In this paper. we will discuss the food security situations in these two countries by studying the historical changes of food supply-demand balance with the concept of agricultural land requirements for food (LRF) from 1963–2009. LRF of a country is a function of population. per capita consumption/diet. cropping yield and cropping intensity. We have attempted to discuss and compare our results in a framework which links consumption of different groups of food items to diet patterns; then. to the total land requirement for food in a scenario when population is growing rapidly and diet diversification and urbanization due to economic reform impose excessive pressure on food security of both countries. We also elaborate on the role of technology dissemination and critically analyze the achievements and drawbacks of government policies to ensure food self-sufficiency and food security of nations. Our results show that the total LRF increases approximately by 42% and 40%. whereas per capita LRF decreases significantly by about 48% and 30% from 1963–2009. for India and China. respectively. Furthermore. our studies reveal that population growth dominates most of the increase in total LRF for India; whereas diet pattern change induced by income growth drives the major increase in LRF for China. Therefore. sustainable management of agricultural land resource is an urgent need both for India and China as there will be demand for more food to meet the …,True,f5RIwvMAAAAJ:StqHo7nPTSoC,37,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/7/5/5371,15654757043941690798,/scholar?cites=15654757043941690798,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/7/5/5371/pdf,0

It follows that treatment failures are common and patients roam from doctor to doctor in search of an effective care program. So there is an urgent need for long-acting and effective therapeutics to alleviate symptoms of the varied forms of chronic pain. During the past few years. a good success has been achieved with a derivative of a neurotoxin. It has been shown that administration of this toxin can block the release of neurotransmitters and pain mediators. Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is well known as a treatment for neuromuscular conditions such as dystonia and spasticity. However. the clinical application for BoNT/A has continued to expand.

In this paper. we propose a novel method for sinusoidal vibration measurement based on motion blurred images. We represent the motion blur information in images by the relationship between the geometric moments of the motion blurred images and the motion. and estimate the vibration parameters from this motion blur cue. We need only one motion blurred image and an unblurred image or two successive frames of blurred images to calculate the parameters of low-frequency vibration as well as the amplitude and direction of high-frequency vibration. while unblurred-image-based techniques rely on much more images to obtain the same results and existing motion-blurred-image-based approaches only estimate the amplitude of high-frequency …,True,f5RIwvMAAAAJ:1pC5hbHeJ6IC,36,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865507000050,5053694002007936943,/scholar?cites=5053694002007936943,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guobao_Wang/publication/223545252_Measurement_of_sinusoidal_vibration_from_motion_blurred_images/links/5cc1eec592851c8d2204e8d2/Measurement-of-sinusoidal-vibration-from-motion-blurred-images.pdf,0

Here we show that mitochondrial complex IV (CIV) activity and assembly are already repressed in white adipocytes of middle-aged mice and involve a HIF1A-dependent decline of essential CIV components such as COX5B. At the molecular level. HIF1A binds to the Cox5b proximal promoter and represses its expression. Silencing of Cox5b decreased fatty acid oxidation and promoted intracellular lipid accumulation. Moreover. local in vivo Cox5b silencing in WAT of young mice increased the size of adipocytes. whereas restoration of COX5B expression in aging mice counteracted adipocyte enlargement.

Accumulating evidence elucidated that glia-mediated inflammatory reactions play a pivotal role in the introduction and development of NP. Besides. activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) pathway in astrocytes has been reported to be critical for spinal astrocytic activation and neuropathic pain development after spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Tanshinone IIA. a major active component of a traditional Chinese drug. Danshen. possesses potent immuno-suppressive activities. The present study was undertaken to assess whether intraperitoneal administration of tanshinone IIA sulfonate (TIIAS) has analgesic effect on SNL-induced neuropathic pain and whether the inhibition of astrocytic activation and JNK/MCP-1 pathway is involved in the analgesic effect of TIIAS. The effects of TIIAS on SNL-induced mechanical allodynia were assessed by behavioral testing.

However. the underlying molecular mechanism of Flot2 in gastric cancer (GC) is largely unknown. qRT-PCR and western blot was performed to detect miR-449a and Flot2 expression in GC cell lines and Normal human gastric epithelial cells. Then. luciferase reporter assay was used to elucidate whether Flot2 is a target gene of miR-449a. Finally. the roles and mechanism of miR-449a in regulation of tumor invasion were further investigated. In this study. miR-449a expression was downregulated and Flot2 was upregulated in all GC cell lines as compared with that in GES-1. luciferase reporter assay identified Flot2 as a novel direct target of miR-449a. miR-449a regulated GC cell invasion by suppressing Flot2 expression. Expression analysis of a set of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers showed that miR-449a reduced the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin and N-cadherin) and induced the expression of epithelial marker (E-cadherin). which was consistent with silenced Flot2. Moreover. Flot2 is necessary for TGF-β-induced EMT in GC cells. Our results demonstrated that miR-449a suppressed Flot2 expression results in decreased cell invasion through repressing TGF-β-mediated-EMT. and provides a new theoretical basis to further investigate miR-449a-regulated Flot2 as a potential biomarker and a promising approach for GC treatment.,True,f5RIwvMAAAAJ:DSCInVXpos0C,32,https://diagnosticpathology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13000-015-0435-5,10473713843729463892,/scholar?cites=10473713843729463892,,https://diagnosticpathology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13000-015-0435-5,0

However. numerous viruses possess evolved strategies to antagonize the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our previous study demonstrated that the nonstructural protein 2C of enterovirus 71 (EV71). which is the major pathogen of hand. foot. and mouth disease. inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-mediated activation of NF-κB by suppressing IκB kinase β (IKKβ) phosphorylation. Nevertheless. the mechanism underlying the inhibition of IKKβ phosphorylation by EV71 2C remains largely elusive.

Since substance P (SP) oscillates in some brain tissues and plays an indispensable role in modulating inflammatory pain at the spinal level. we speculated that SP mediates circadian nociception transmission at the spinal level.In the present study behavioral observation. real-time polymerase chain reaction. luciferase assay. chromatin immunoprecipitation. and immunohistochemistry stain methods were used to investigate the role of SP in the spinal circadian nociception transmission and its regulation mechanism.Our results showed that under transcriptional regulation of BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimers. SP's coding gene Tac1 expression oscillates in dorsal root ganglion (n = 36). but not in the spinal dorsal horn. Further. the expression of SP cycled in the spinal dorsal horn. and this rhythmicity was potentially determined by circadian expression of Tac1 in dorsal root ganglion. Furthermore. the variation of SP expression induced by formalin was fluctuated in a similar rhythm to behavioral nociceptive response induced by formalin (n = 48); and the nociceptive behavioral circadian rhythm could be abolished through blockade of the SP-Neurokinin 1 receptor pathway (n = 70).

For the power factor correction (PFC) stage. the conventional constant frequency average current mode control has very low efficiency at light load due to high switching frequency related loss. The constant on-time control for PFC features the automatic reduction of switching frequency at light load. resulting improved light load efficiency. However. lower heavy load efficiency of the constant on-time control is observed because of very high frequency at Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM).

Paleomagnetic analysis of 121 sites (326 samples) reveals that the Shanghuan–Nongshanian boundary lies close to a normal-to-reverse polarity change.

However. SCR catalysts suffer from low activity and selectivity to N2 at low temperature. which in part may be attributed to our limited understanding of the reaction mechanism. Here. an unambiguous molecular-level mechanism is presented for an improved low-temperature SCR activity using bifunctional catalysts composed of highly active oxides (Mn2O3) for NH3 activation and highly selective vanadates (Mn2V2O7) that promote N2 formation. NH3 is initially activated by Mn2O3 to form an NH2 intermediate. Transfer of NH2 to Mn2V2O7 then takes place. which facilitates the capture of gaseous NO leading to the formation of NH2NO over Mn2V2O7. whereafter NH2NO is efficiently converted to the preferred N2 rather than …,True,f5RIwvMAAAAJ:TxzIK0FlDbcC,28,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscatal.8b00196,4867817695423944764,/scholar?cites=4867817695423944764,,http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2164/12202/Catalysis_Accepted_Manuscript.pdf?sequence=1,0

Rutin is a type of flavonoid which exhibits significant scavenging properties on oxygen radicals both in vitro and in vivo. In this study. we proposed that rutin attenuated hypoxia-induced pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation by scavenging ROS. Immunofluorescence data showed that rutin decreased the production of ROS. which was mainly generated through mitochondria and NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs). Western blot results provided further evidence on rutin increasing expression of Nox4 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Moreover. cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry indicated that proliferation of PASMCs triggered by hypoxia was also repressed by rutin. However. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). a scavenger of ROS. abolished or diminished the capability of rutin in repressing hypoxia-induced cell proliferation. These data suggest that rutin shows a potential benefit against the development of hypoxic pulmonary arterial hypertension by inhibiting ROS. subsequently preventing hypoxia-induced PASMC proliferation.

Pregnant rats were administered either saline or (−) cocaine (15 mg/kg. SC b.i.d.) from gestational day 13–20. Progeny were fostered to nontreated lactating dams at birth. Central serotonergic function was determined by the ability of a serotonin releaser. p-chloroamphetamine (PCA). to stimulate plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). corticosterone. and renin secretion in female progeny at postnatal day (PD) 30.

60069,An ontology-guided semantic data integration framework to support integrative data analysis of cancer survival,2018,Hansi Zhang and Yi Guo and Qian Li and Thomas J George and Elizabeth Shenkman and François Modave and Jiang Bian,18,BMC medical informatics and decision making,2,129-147,BioMed Central,Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. exceeded only by heart disease. Extant cancer survival analyses have primarily focused on individual-level factors due to limited data availability from a single data source. There is a need to integrate data from different sources to simultaneously study as much risk factors as possible. Thus. we proposed an ontology-based approach to integrate heterogeneous datasets addressing key data integration challenges. Following best practices in ontology engineering. we created the Ontology for Cancer Research Variables (OCRV) adapting existing semantic resources such as the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Thesaurus. Using the global-as-view data integration approach. we created mapping axioms to link the data elements in different sources to OCRV. Implemented upon the Ontop platform. we built a data integration pipeline to query. extract. and transform data in relational databases using semantic queries into a pooled dataset according to the downstream multi-level Integrative Data Analysis (IDA) needs. Based on our use cases in the cancer survival IDA. we created tailored ontological structures in OCRV to facilitate the data integration tasks. Specifically. we created a flexible framework addressing key integration challenges: (1) using a shared. controlled vocabulary to make data understandable to both human and computers. (2) explicitly modeling the semantic relationships makes it possible to compute and reason with the data. (3) linking patients to contextual and environmental factors through geographic variables.

60070,Key role of ROS in the process of 15-lipoxygenase/15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoiccid-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling in hypoxia pulmonary hypertension,2016,Qian Li and Min Mao and Yanli Qiu and Gaofeng Liu and Tingting Sheng and Xiufeng Yu and Shuang Wang and Daling Zhu,11,PLoS One,2,e0149164,Public Library of Science,We previously reported that 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) and its metabolite 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) were up-regulated in pulmonary arterial cells from both pulmonary artery hypertension patients and hypoxic rats and that these factors mediated the progression of pulmonary hypertension (PH) by affecting the proliferation and apoptosis of pulmonary arterial (PA) cells. However. the underlying mechanisms of the remodeling induced by 15-HETE have remained unclear. As reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 15-LO are both induced by hypoxia. it is possible that ROS are involved in the events of hypoxia-induced 15-LO expression that lead to PH. We employed immunohistochemistry. tube formation assays. bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assays. and cell cycle analyses to explore the role of ROS in the process of 15-HETE-mediated hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH). We found that exogenous 15-HETE facilitated the generation of ROS and that this effect was mainly localized to mitochondria. In particular. the mitochondrial electron transport chain and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 (Nox4) were responsible for the significant 15-HETE-stimulated increase in ROS production. Moreover. ROS induced by 15-HETE stimulated endothelial cell (EC) migration and promoted pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation under hypoxia via the p38 MAPK pathway. These results indicated that 15-HETE-regulated ROS mediated hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling (PVR) via the p38 MAPK pathway.,True,f5RIwvMAAAAJ:q_HmSUDeXG8C,27,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149164,14309572555476051210,/scholar?cites=14309572555476051210,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149164,0

This role of NT is thought to be mediated by both neurotensin receptor subtype 1 (NTS1) and neurotensin receptor subtype 2 (NTS2). NT and its receptors are widely distributed in the pain circuits in central nervous system. Thus NT might modulate pain in many structures of pain pathway. such as spinal cord. rostroventral medulla (RVM) and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Actually either intrathecal application of NT or direct injection of NT into RVM or PAG or intracerebroventricular injection of NT showed analgesic effects. NT exerted its antinociceptive effects in both acute pain and chronic pain models. The analgesic effects of NT were originally found in acute pain experiments.

However. the prognostic value of KRAS mutation in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in cancer patients was conflicting. In the present study. a meta-analysis was conducted to clarify its prognostic significance. Literature searches of Cochrane Library. EMBASE. PubMed and Web of Science were performed to identify studies related to KRAS mutation detected by cfDNA and survival in cancer patients. Two evaluators reviewed and extracted the information independently. Review Manager 5.3 software was used to perform the statistical analysis. Thirty studies were included in the present meta-analysis. Our analysis showed that KRAS mutation in cfDNA was associated with a poorer survival in cancer patients for overall survival (OS. HR 2.02. 95% CI 1.63–2.51. P<0.01) and progression-free survival (PFS. HR 1.64. 95% CI 1.27–2.13. P<0.01). In subgroup analyses. KRAS mutation in pancreatic cancer. colorectal cancer. non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian epithelial cancer had HRs of 2.81 (95% CI 1.83–4.30. P<0.01). 1.67 (95% CI 1.25–2.42.

Combined with information from national health registries they can be used in population-based studies of genetic diseases. DNA extracted from neonatal DBSs can be amplified to obtain micrograms of an otherwise limited resource. referred to as whole-genome amplified DNA (wgaDNA). Here we investigate the robustness of exome sequencing of wgaDNA of neonatal DBS samples. We conducted three pilot studies of seven. eight and seven subjects. respectively. For each subject we analysed a neonatal DBS sample and corresponding adult whole-blood (WB) reference sample. Different DNA sample types were prepared for each of the subjects.

Changes in the neural circuits may occur in the early stages in diabetes and are implicated in the development of DPN. Therefore. we aimed to detect changes in the expression of isolectin B4 (IB4. the marker for nonpeptidergic unmyelinated fibers and their cell bodies) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP. the marker for peptidergic fibers and their cell bodies) in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic rats showing alterations in sensory and motor function. We also used cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) to show the morphological changes of the myelinated fibers and motor neurons. STZ-induced diabetic rats exhibited hyperglycemia. decreased body weight gain. mechanical allodynia and impaired locomotor activity. In the DRG and spinal dorsal horn. IB4-labeled structures decreased. but both CGRP immunostaining and CTB labeling increased from day 14 to day 28 in diabetic rats. In spinal ventral horn. CTB labeling decreased in motor neurons in diabetic rats.

The sensors are made in SOI (silicon on insulator) wafers leading to a very simple fabrication process. The use of relatively thick single crystal silicon for the in plane bridges result in structures with good mechanical properties as compared to alternative surface micromachining processes and reduces problems with buckling and sticking. Since. the proposed Pirani has three heat sinks. the area of heat loss through the ambient gas is greatly enlarged as compared to Pirani sensors with one or two heat sinks. without increasing the size of the sensor. Consequently. a Pirani sensor of 336 μm in length has a pressure measurement range of 0.08–200 Torr. Alternative designs have shown measurement ranges varying between 0.02 and 500 Torr.

60106,The numerical scheme development of a simplified frozen soil model,2009,Qian Li and Shufen Sun and Qiudan Dai,26,Advances in atmospheric sciences,5,940-950,SP Science Press,In almost all frozen soil models used currently. three variables of temperature. ice content and moisture content are used as prognostic variables and the rate term. accounting for the contribution of the phase change between water and ice. is shown explicitly in both the energy and mass balance equations. The models must be solved by a numerical method with an iterative process. and the rate term of the phase change needs to be pre-estimated at the beginning in each iteration step. Since the rate term of the phase change in the energy equation is closely related to the release or absorption of the great amount of fusion heat. a small error in the rate term estimation will introduce greater error in the energy balance. which will amplify the error in the temperature calculation and in turn. cause problems for the numerical solution convergence.

The effects of galena on thiosulfate decomposition and gold leaching and the possible effect mechanisms were studied by the thermodynamic calculation. leaching tests. SEM-EDS and XPS analyses. Results showed that from the onset of gold leaching. the leaching kinetics was restricted severely in the presence of galena. This is caused by the fact that galena is easily oxidized by copper(II) and the dissolved oxygen. thus the mixed slurry potentials initially experienced a significant decline to relatively stable lower levels of 230–240 mV which are nearly 50 mV lower than that of the quartz slurry. This is disadvantageous to gold leaching and results in undesirable gold dissolutions during the process.
