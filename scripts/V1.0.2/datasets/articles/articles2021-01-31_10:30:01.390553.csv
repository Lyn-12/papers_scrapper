The intensity of pain at the beginning and end of treatment was assessed with a visual analogue scale. and these results along with the number of hospital admissions for pancreatic disease were analyzed. METHODS: We studied patients with acute recurrent or chronic pancreatitis who had suffered from pain or acute inflammatory episodes the year before the beginning of treatment with a complex containing L-methionine. beta-carotene. vitamin C. vitamin E and organic selenium. RESULTS: Of 10 patients with chronic pancreatitis who completed treatment. the intensity of pain was reduced considerably in 9 (61.5+/-21.5 mm vs. 19.6+/-26.1 mm. p= 0.03). and pain was completely absent in 3 of these patients. Twelve patients who completed treatment had fewer hospital admissions during the year with antioxidant treatment than they had had during the previous year (1.5+/-1.62 vs. 0.25+/-0.45 admissions. p= 0.03).

However. little is known about the signalling pathways that are engaged by probiotics. Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells that are involved in immunity and tolerance. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and murine DCs are different from human gut DCs; therefore. in this study. we used human DCs generated from CD34+ progenitor cells (hematopoietic stem cells) harvested from umbilical cord blood; those DCs exhibited surface antigens of dendritic Langerhans cells. similar to the lamina propria DCs in the gut. We report that both a novel probiotic strain isolated from faeces of exclusively breast-fed newborn infants. Lactobacillus paracasei CNCM I-4034. and its cell-free culture supernatant (CFS) decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in human intestinal DCs challenged with Salmonella. Interestingly. the supernatant was as effective as the bacteria in reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. In contrast. the bacterium was a potent inducer of TGF-β2 secretion. whereas the supernatant increased the secretion of TGF-β1 in response to Salmonella. We also showed that both the bacteria and its supernatant enhanced innate immunity through the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling. These treatments strongly induced the transcription of the TLR9 gene. In addition. upregulation of the CASP8 and TOLLIP genes was observed.

The presence of very low concentrations of the polysaccharides (typically < ∼0.075%) was found to induce depletion flocculation of the emulsion droplets and increased the rate of creaming. However. at higher polysaccharide concentrations (typically > ∼0.1%) the creaming rate was reduced due to the increased viscosity of the aqueous phase. For most systems a delay period was noted before creaming started. which was found to be dependent on the zero shear viscosity of the continuous phase and independent of polysaccharide type. The delay period increased significantly at zero shear viscosities approaching 1 Pa s.

63398,Genetic susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in childhood.,2013,Concepción M Aguilera and Josune Olza and Ángel Gil,28,,,,,Obesity is one of the major public health problems worldwide. It is a chronic. complex. and multifactorialorigin disease characterised by body fat excess mainly due to an imbalance between dietary intake and energy expenditure. One of the major complications of obesity is metabolic syndrome. which comprises anthropometrical. clinical. and metabolic dysfunctions that predispose the affected individual to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. It is hypothesised that the variability in the susceptibility to obesity-mediated metabolic complications involves both environmental and genetic factors. Whereas advances in the knowledge of the variations in the human genome have led to the identification of susceptibility genes that contribute to obesity and related disorders. relatively few studies have specifically focused on the interactions between obesity and genetic polymorphisms and the development of metabolic complications. Despite these limited efforts. an increasing amount of evidence suggests that the effects of some gene variants on metabolic traits are modified by or present only in the setting of obesity. Furthermore. some of these loci may have larger effects on metabolic phenotypes in the presence of certain dietary or lifestyle factors. In the present manuscript. we reviewed the genes and their variants that have been evidenced to play a role in obesity-associated metabolic complications through genetic association studies. including candidate gene and genome-wide association approaches in adults and children.,True,cL_TePcAAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC,66,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.838.1496&rep=rep1&type=pdf,271452687107047283,/scholar?cites=271452687107047283,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.838.1496&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

Alternate ablation of Al2O3 and Er targets has been used to control the in-depth distribution and in-plane concentration of Er3+ ions independently. The characteristic Er3+ photoluminescence response at 1.53 μm has been studied as a function of the Er3+ distribution. It is found that lifetime values can be greatly increased by increasing the Er3+–Er3+ in-depth separation above 3 nm. This result can be related to a reduced Er3+–Er3+ energy migration process. The in-plane Er3+ concentration was increased by either increasing the number of pulses on the Er target or the laser energy density for ablation. By the latter method in-plane concentrations as high as 1.1×1014 Er cm−2 per layer (corresponding to 2×1020 Er cm−3) were achieved. while keeping lifetime values …,True,cL_TePcAAAAJ:Oo_WeVVXg5wC,65,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1409575,13252700079093982514,/scholar?cites=13252700079093982514,,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/21461/1/GetPDFServlet.pdf,0

Seventy-two sites distributed around the globe were evaluated following the standardized sampling protocol of the Census of Marine Life NaGISA project (www.nagisa.coml.org). There were no clear patterns of standardized estimators of species richness along latitudinal gradients or among Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs); however. a strong latitudinal gradient in taxonomic composition (i.e.. proportion of different taxonomic groups in a given sample) was observed. Environmental variables related to natural influences were strongly related to the distribution patterns of the assemblages on the LME scale. particularly photoperiod. sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall. In contrast. no environmental variables directly associated with human influences (with the exception of the inorganic pollution index) were related to assemblage patterns among LMEs. Correlations of the natural assemblages with either latitudinal gradients or environmental variables were equally strong suggesting that neither neutral models nor models based solely on environmental variables sufficiently explain spatial variation of these assemblages at a global scale.

Food and beverage intakes were assessed in a food diary over three days. Day and time of beverage consumption were also recorded. Results: On average. TWI was 1.7 L (SE 21.2) for men and 1.6 L (SE 18.9) for women. More than 75% of participants had inadequate TWI. according to European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommendations. Mean total energy intake (EI) was 1810 kcal/day (SE 11.1). of which 12% was provided by beverages. Water was the most consumed beverage. followed by milk.

Phase 2 (2011) added Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) tools and was based on: a) Increase of alcohol hand rub (AHR) solution placement (from 0.57 dispensers/bed to 1.56); b) Increase in frequency of audits (three days every three weeks: “3/3 strategy”); c) Implementation of a standardized register form of HH corrective actions; d) Statistical Process Control (SPC) as time series analysis methodology through appropriate control charts. During the intervention period we performed 819 scheduled direct observation audits which provided data from 11.714 HH opportunities. The most remarkable findings were: a) significant improvements in HH compliance with respect to baseline (25% mean increase); b) sustained high level (82%) of HH compliance during intervention; c) significant increase in AHRs consumption over time; c) significant decrease in the rate of healthcare-acquired MRSA; d) small but significant improvements in HH compliance when comparing phase 2 to phase 1 [79.5% (95% CI: 78.2–80.7) vs 84.6% (95% CI:83.8–85.4). p<0.05]; e) successful use of control charts to identify significant negative and positive deviations (special causes) related to the HH compliance process over time (“positive”: 90.1% as highest HH compliance coinciding with …,True,cL_TePcAAAAJ:8p-ueveQw4wC,54,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047200,10312231556350485611,/scholar?cites=10312231556350485611,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047200,0

Linoleic acid was increased in infants fed formulas in all plasma lipid fractions with respect to those fed HM. Plasma phospholipids in MF-fed infants had lower percentages of PUFA of both omega 6 and omega 3 series. namely arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids. than those fed HM or NMF; the unsaturation index was decreased in infants fed MF as compared to those fed HM or NMF. Arachidonic acid showed a similar behaviour in plasma cholesteryl esters as in phospholipids. No changes for long chain PUFA among the groups studied were observed for plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids. These results support previous findings that dietary nucleotides are involved in the regulation of desaturation and elongation of linoleic and linolenic acid to their longer superior homologous fatty acids.

As most AM technologies. anisotropy of parts made by DLP is a key issue to deal with. taking into account that several operational factors modify this characteristic. Design for this technology and photopolymers becomes a challenge because the manufacturing process and post-processing strongly influence the mechanical properties of the part. This paper shows experimental work to demonstrate the particular behavior of parts made using DLP. Being different to any other AM technology. rules for design need to be adapted. Influence of build direction and post-curing process on final mechanical properties and anisotropy are reported and justified based on experimental data and theoretical simulation of bi-material parts formed by fully-cured resin and partially-cured resin. Three photopolymers were tested under different working conditions. concluding that post-curing can. in some cases. correct the anisotropy. mainly depending on the nature of photopolymer.

Only 36.1% of the population had an optimal anthropometric situation (BMI < 25 kg/m2. WHtR < 0.5). whereas 50.1% had weight excess and high WHtR (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2. WHtR ≥ 0.5). Conclusions. More than half of Spanish population has weight excess and cardiometabolic risk. The results of this study provide an understanding of the current anthropometric situation in the Spanish population. as a first step toward planning interventions and assessing their effectiveness in the future.,True,cL_TePcAAAAJ:w0odbtu79TwC,51,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2016/8341487/abs/,13574615080996885156,/scholar?cites=13574615080996885156,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2016/8341487/abs/,0

We found a significant correlation (r= 0.5564; p= 0.0165) between ganglioside and total lipid contents. There was a selective change in the relative concentrations of GD3 and GM3 during lactation. The most abundant ganglioside in samples from the first three weeks of lactation was GD3. whereas after the first month. GM3 was the major ganglioside. In addition to GD3 and GM3. previously known to be present in human milk. we detected several previously unreported highly polar gangliosides.,True,cL_TePcAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC,51,https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/bchm/376/12/article-p723.xml,18124596253924323689,/scholar?cites=18124596253924323689,,,0

Both methods were used to assay 10 identical samples of an adapted cow's milk infant formula and 10 samples of soya protein formula. Precision was determined. the variance of each method was measured. and the methods were compared with each other. The variances of the two methods were not statistically different nor was there any significant difference between the results from the two methods. Therefore. it was concluded that both methods can be used for determination of ascorbic acid in infant formulas. The voltammetric method. because of its simplicity. cheapness and less time-consuming nature. could be used for routine determination.,True,cL_TePcAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C,51,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0308814694P4188L,8025565038793710018,/scholar?cites=8025565038793710018,,,0

63388,The influence of dietary nucleotides on humoral and cell immunity in the neonate and lactating infant,2001,José Maldonado and Joaquın Navarro and Eduardo Narbona and Angel Gil,65,,,S69-S74,Elsevier,The organism constantly requires nucleotides. especially for tissues that present a high rate of turnover. such as the cells of the immune system. In certain circumstances. nucleotides may become semi-essential nutrients required by a particular organ. There is evidence of the potentia1 role of exogenous nucleotides as regulators of the immune function. In experiments carried out with animals. studies have shown that dietary nucleotides stimulate the humoral immune response to T-dependent antigens and raise total antibody levels. The present study reveals an increase in the production of immunoglobulins. an improved response to vaccines. a reduction in morbidity and increased tolerance to dietary antigens. Therefore. the addition of nucleotides to formula appears to favour the immune function.,True,cL_TePcAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC,73,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378201002080,11696572328889954820,/scholar?cites=11696572328889954820,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.384.505&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0
