56754,AMPK in health and disease,2009,Gregory R Steinberg and Bruce E Kemp,89,,3,1025-1078,American Physiological Society,The function and survival of all organisms is dependent on the dynamic control of energy metabolism. when energy demand is matched to energy supply. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) αβγ heterotrimer has emerged as an important integrator of signals that control energy balance through the regulation of multiple biochemical pathways in all eukaryotes. In this review. we begin with the discovery of the AMPK family and discuss the recent structural studies that have revealed the molecular basis for AMP binding to the enzyme's γ subunit. AMPK's regulation involves autoinhibitory features and phosphorylation of both the catalytic α subunit and the β-targeting subunit. We review the role of AMPK at the cellular level through examination of its many substrates and discuss how it controls cellular energy balance. We look at how AMPK integrates stress responses such as exercise as well as nutrient and …,True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,1526,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/physrev.00011.2008,1773194987387231241,/scholar?cites=1773194987387231241,,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00011.2008,0

The hypercalcemia results from the actions of tumor factors on bone and kidney. We report here the isolation of full-length complementary DNA clones of a putative hypercalcemia factor. and the expression from the cloned DNA of the active protein in mammalian cells. The clones encode a prepro peptide of 36 amino acids and a mature protein of 141 amino acids that has significant homology with parathyroid hormone in the amino-terminal region.

56756,Protein kinase C contains a pseudosubstrate prototope in its regulatory domain,1987,Colin House and Bruce E Kemp,238,Science,4834,1726-1728,American Association for the Advancement of Science,The regulatory domain of protein kinase C contains an amino acid sequence between residues 19 and 36 that resembles a substrate phosphorylation site in its distribution of basic residue recognition determinants. The corresponding synthetic peptide (Arg19-Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala25-Leu-Arg-Gln-Lys-Asn-Val-His -Glu-Val-Lys-Asn36) acts as a potent substrate antagonist with an inhibitory constant of 147 +/- 9 nM. It is a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C and inhibits both autophosphorylation and protein substrate phosphorylation. Substitution of Ala25 with serine transforms the pseudosubstrate into a potent substrate. These results demonstrate that the conserved region of the regulatory domain (residues 19 to 36) of protein kinase C has the secondary structural features of a pseudosubstrate and may be responsible for maintaining the enzyme in the inactive form in the absence of allosteric activators such as …,True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1157,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/238/4834/1726.abstract,10652189477482402064,/scholar?cites=10652189477482402064,,,0

In the present study. we assessed whether the agonist-induced (Ca2+-dependent. high-output) activation of eNOS is associated with changes in the phosphorylation of Thr495 in the calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain. eNOS Thr495 was constitutively phosphorylated in porcine aortic endothelial cells and was rapidly dephosphorylated after bradykinin stimulation. In the same cells. bradykinin enhanced the phosphorylation of Ser1177. which was maximal after 5 minutes. and abolished by the CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor KN-93.

A greater fall in plasma glucose from baseline occurred during rHDL than during placebo (at 4 hours rHDL 2.60. 4; placebo 2.10. 3mmol/L; P 0.018). rHDL increased plasma insulin (at 4 hours rHDL3. 410.0; placebo 19.27. 4 pmol/L; P 0.034) and also the homeostasis model assessment ß-cell function index (at 4 hours rHDL18. 95.9; placebo8. 64.4%; P 0.025).

While insulin is known to activate ACC in several cell types. accompanied by changes in ACC phosphorylation. the mechanism underlying this activation has been obscure. In the present study. we have examined. in Fao hepatoma cells. the effects of insulin on ACC and AMPK activity. the latter measured with a synthetic peptide corresponding to one of the phosphorylation sites on ACC for AMPK.

Recent discoveries demonstrate that AMPK is activated primarily by rising ADP levels and not. as previously thought. by AMP. AMPK activation is dependent on ADP-controlled phosphorylation of Thr172 on its activation loop. a mechanism of protein regulation that represents an example of an allosterically regulated modification (ARM). AMPK embodies many features of an adenylate charge regulatory system envisaged by Atkinson. where anabolic and catabolic pathway regulation is modulated by adenine nucleotide ratios.

A complementary DNA representing a portion of the smaller 50-kilodalton subunit of the rat brain enzyme has been cloned and sequenced. The calmodulin-binding region has been identified and a synthetic analog prepared that binds calmodulin with high affinity in the presence of calcium. Like the 50-kilodalton kinase polypeptide. the concentration of the messenger RNA varies both neuroanatomically and during postnatal development of the brain. The broad tissue and species cross-reactivity of the complementary DNA suggests that the 50-kilodalton subunit found in rat brain is evolutionarily conserved and is the product of a single gene.,True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,186,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/237/4812/293.abstract,1693839901485220866,/scholar?cites=1693839901485220866,,,0

Many protein kinases exist as catalytically inactive or latent forms unless activated by the binding of a ligand or by covalent modification. such as phosphorylation. The inactive form of protein kinases results from the presence of an autoinhibitory region that masks the catalytic activity.

Several lines of evidence show that these changes are driven largely by impaired tissue mitochondrial metabolism. While exercise is associated with numerous health benefits. there is no evidence that it affects skin tissue or that endocrine muscle‐to‐skin signaling occurs. We demonstrate that endurance exercise attenuates age‐associated changes to skin in humans and mice and identify exercise‐induced IL‐15 as a novel regulator of mitochondrial function in aging skin.

AMPK is activated in response to rises in intracellular AMP or calcium‐mediated signalling and is responsible for phosphorylating a wide variety of substrates. Recent structural studies have revealed the architecture of the αβγ subunit interactions as well as the AMP binding pockets on the γ subunit. The α catalytic domain (1–280) is autoinhibited by a C‐terminal tail (313–335). which is proposed to interact with the small lobe of the catalytic domain by homology modelling with the MARK2 protein structure.

The method. named Predikin. identifies key conserved substrate-determining residues in the kinase catalytic domain that contact the substrate in the region of the phosphorylation site and so determine the sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site. Predikin was implemented originally as a web application written in Javascript. Here. we describe a new version of Predikin. completely revised and rewritten as a modular framework that provides multiple enhancements compared with the original. Predikin now consists of two components: (i) PredikinDB. a database of phosphorylation sites that links substrates to kinase sequences and (ii) a Perl module. which provides methods to classify protein kinases. reliably identify substrate-determining residues. generate scoring matrices and score putative phosphorylation sites in query sequences. The performance of Predikin as measured using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) graph analysis equals or surpasses that of existing comparable methods. The Predikin website has been redesigned to incorporate the new features. New features in Predikin include the use of SQL queries to PredikinDB to generate predictions. scoring of predictions. more reliable identification of substrate-determining residues and putative phosphorylation sites. extended options to handle protein kinase and substrate data and an improved web interface. The new features significantly enhance the ability of Predikin to analyse protein kinases and their substrates.

Activation of AMPK provides beneficial outcomes in fighting against metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Currently. there is no allosteric AMPK activator available for the treatment of metabolic diseases. and limited compounds are available to robustly stimulate cellular/tissue AMPK in a specific manner. Here we investigated whether simultaneous administration of two different pharmacological AMPK activators. which bind and act on different sites. would result in an additive or synergistic effect on AMPK and its downstream signaling and physiological events in intact cells.

The energy-sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of endothelial cell lipid metabolism. To test the hypothesis that bradykinin (BK) regulates AMPK and fatty acid oxidation in endothelium. stimulations of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) with bradykinin were performed. BK stimulation caused a 2.3-fold increase in AMPK activity (p < 0.05). Activation of AMPK by BK in BAECs was inhibited by STO-609. an inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK). which is a known kinase upstream of AMPK. BK stimulation of BAECs also increased phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and this was inhibited by both STO-609 and over expression of an adenovirus encoded AMPK dominant negative (Ad-AMPK-DN).

Animal and retrospective human studies indicate that Metformin treatment is neuroprotective in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). although the neuroprotective mechanism is unknown. numerous studies suggest the beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis may be through AMPK activation. In this study we tested whether or not AMPK activation in dopamine neurons was required for the neuroprotective effects of Metformin in PD. We generated transgenic mice in which AMPK activity in dopamine neurons was ablated by removing AMPK beta 1 and beta 2 subunits from dopamine transporter expressing neurons. These AMPK WT and KO mice were then chronically exposed to Metformin in the drinking water then exposed to MPTP. the mouse model of PD. Chronic Metformin treatment significantly attenuated the MPTP-induced loss of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) neuronal number and volume and TH protein concentration in the nigrostriatal pathway. Additionally. Metformin treatment prevented the MPTP-induced elevation of the DOPAC:DA ratio regardless of genotype. Metformin also prevented MPTP induced gliosis in the Substantia Nigra.

We used recombinant S100A1 to further characterize the interaction between the two proteins. Zn2+ enhanced the binding of Ca2+/S100A1 to twitchin kinase fragments (Kd < 50 nM) in assays using a BIAcore biosensor by reducing the S100A1 off rate. Other Ca2+‐binding proteins (S100A6. calmodulin. and the calmodulin‐like domain of Ca2+‐dependent protein kinase α) bound to the kinase but did not activate it.

MA,Whereas Ca2+ serves as the primary intracellular messenger for regulation of contraction in all types of muscle. the underlying molecular mechanisms are different. Striated muscles utilize troponin C as the Ca2+ receptor and contain an array of cell specific proteins involved in maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis. Phosphorylation reactions are important in regulation of contraction but phosphorylation of myosin light chains does not play a major role in force generation (Sweeney and Stull. 1990). Smooth muscles utilize calmodulin as the Ca2+ receptor and phosphorylation of myosin light chains is the rate-limiting reaction in contractility (Kamm and Stull. 1985).

According to this model. smMLCK is autoinhibited in the absence of Ca2+/CaM due to the interaction of a pseudosubstrate prototope. contained within the CaM binding/regulatory region. with the active site of the enzyme. Binding of Ca2+/CaM releases the autoinhibition and allows access of the protein substrate to the active site of the enzyme. resulting in phosphorylation of the myosin light chains.

Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations occur principally by Ca2+ influx through plasma membrane Ca2+ channels or through release from internal storage compartments (Fig. 1). The binding of Ca2+ to a calmodulin. a modulator protein found in all eukaryotic cells. leads to a conformation capable of binding to an inactive myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). This binding results in isomerization of MLCK to an active form. which subsequently phosphorylates serine 19 of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC). For myosin from smooth and nonmuscle cells. RLC phosphorylation markedly increases actin-activated myosin MgATPase activity. Myosin RLC phosphorylation plays a central role in many cellular processes. including initiation of smooth muscle contraction (Kamm and Stull. 1985a; Hartshorne. 1987). platelet aggregation (Sellers and Adelstein. 1987). endothelial cell retraction (Sheldon et al.. 1993). exocytosis (Choi et al.. 1994). and lymphocyte receptor capping (Kerrick and Bourguignon. 1984). In skeletal and cardiac muscle. the actin-activated myosin MgATPase activity is maximal. even in the absence of RLC phosphorylation. However. RLC phosphorylation by a unique MLCK appears to move the cross-bridge away from the thick filament backbone. leading to potentiation of skeletal muscle contraction (Sweeney et al.. 1993).

AMPK inhibits fatty acid synthesis and promotes fatty acid oxidation by phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1 at Ser79 and ACC2 at Ser212. Using mice with Ser79Ala/Ser212Ala knock-in mutations (ACC DKI) we find that inhibition of ACC phosphorylation leads to reduced appetite in response to fasting or cold exposure. At sub-thermoneutral temperatures. ACC DKI mice maintain normal energy expenditure and thermogenesis. but fail to increase appetite and lose weight. We demonstrate that the ACC DKI phenotype can be mimicked in wild type mice using a ghrelin receptor antagonist and that ACC DKI mice have impaired orexigenic responses to ghrelin. indicating ACC DKI mice have a ghrelin signaling defect.

Results Basal expression of activated AMPK. phosphorylayed at αThr172. was markedly reduced by 96% in AMPK-β1−/− mice. Acute renal ischaemia caused a 3.2-fold increase in α1-AMPK activity and a 2.5-fold increase in α2-AMPK activity (P<0.001) that was associated with an increase in AMPK phosphorylation of the AMPK-α subunit at Thr172 and Ser485. and increased inhibitory phosphorylation of the AMPK substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase.

Here. we investigated the protective effects in a 3-day unilateral ureteral obstruction (3dUUO) mouse model. Compared with controls. ureteral obstructed animals displayed increased tubular damage and inflammation. Metformin treatment attenuated inflammation. increased the anti-oxidative response and decreased tubular damage.

Km's are increased appreciably with analogues in which the N-terminal cluster of basic residues is reduced or where alanine is substituted for Arg238. Even more dramatic effects are elicited by alanine substitution of one of the adjacent serine residues. resulting in 20-fold to 800-fold increases in the Km's for the [Ala235] and [Ala236] S6 (229-239) variants. respectively.

In this study we show the energy-sensing kinase AMPK inhibits NKCC1 activity. Three separate AMPK activators (AICAR. Phenformin and A-769662) inhibited NKCC1 flux in a variety of nucleated cells. Treatment with A-769662 resulted in a reduction of NKCC1T212/T217 phosphorylation. and this was reversed by treatment with the non-selective AMPK inhibitor Compound C. AMPK dependence was confirmed by treatment of AMPK null mouse embryonic fibroblasts. where A-769662 had no effect on NKCC1 mediated transport.

The kinase mediates most. if not all. of the cellular functions of cAMP. Physiologically. the series of events leading to cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation begins with the binding of a hormone or other agent to a cell surface receptor. In many cases. the binding leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase and a consequential increase in the intracellular level of cAMP. In eukaryotes. the major. if not sole. cellular receptor of cAMP is the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The kinase is activated upon binding of cAMP to its regulatory subunits.

However. its underlying mechanism of action is not completely understood. In this study. we have shown that a level of metrnl increase in vitro under electrical-pulse-stimulation (EPS) and in vivo in exercise mice. suggesting that metrnl is an exercise-induced myokine. In addition. metrnl increases glucose uptake through the calcium-dependent AMPK pathway. Metrnl also increases the phosphorylation of HDAC5. a transcriptional repressor of GLUT4. in an AMPK-dependent manner. Phosphorylated HDAC5 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins and sequesters them in the cytoplasm. resulting in the activation of GLUT4 transcription. The intraperitoneal injection of recombinant metrnl improves glucose tolerance in mice with high fat-induced obesity or type 2 diabetes (db/db). but this is not seen in AMPK β1β2 muscle-specific null mice (AMPK β1β2 MKO).

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of cellular energetics and plays essential roles regulating macrophage lipid dynamics. Here. we investigated the consequences of atherogenic lipoprotein-induced foam cell formation on downstream immunometabolic signaling in primary mouse macrophages. A variety of atherogenic low-density lipoproteins (acetylated. oxidized. and aggregated forms) activated AMPK signaling in a manner that was in part due to CD36 and calcium-related signaling. In quiescent macrophages. basal AMPK signaling was crucial for maintaining markers of lysosomal homeostasis as well as levels of key components in the lysosomal expression and regulation network. Moreover. AMPK activation resulted in targeted upregulation of members of this network via transcription factor EB. However. in lipid-induced macrophage foam cells. neither basal AMPK signaling nor its activation affected lysosomal-associated programs.

The spectrum of liver pathology in NAFLD ranges from steatosis to more serious disorders. such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. fibrosis and chirrosis with increased risk of liver failure and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore. NAFLD is an important risk factor for chronic diseases. such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.Despite the prevalence and seriousness of complications. the only currently accepted treatment for NAFLD are lifestyle changes leading to weight reduction. However. these benefits are often mitigated by high attrition rates and weight gain rebound highlighting the need for novel pharmaceutical strategies to improve NAFLD. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy-sensing enzyme that is activated in response to energy stress. Once activated. AMPK promotes ATP-generating catabolic pathways and inhibits ATP-consuming anabolic pathways to restore energy balance. AMPK effects on lipid metabolism include the reduction of intracellular lipid levels through inhibition of de novo lipogenesis and promotion of fatty acid oxidation. AMPK activity is reduced in obesity and type 2 diabetes. the most common conditions associated with NAFLD. AMPK activation has therefore been proposed as an attractive strategy for the improvement of hepatic steatosis.

N-terminal myristoylation of the ?-subunit has been shown to suppress Thr172 phosphorylation. keeping AMPK in an inactive state. Here we use amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to investigate the structural and dynamic properties of the mammalian myristoylated and non-myristoylated inactivated AMPK (D139A) in the presence and absence of nucleotides. HDX MS data suggests that the myristoyl group binds near the first helix of the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain similar to other kinases. Our data. however. also shows that ATP.Mg2+ results in a global stabilization of myristoylated. but not non-myristoylated AMPK. and most notably for peptides of the activation loop of the ?-kinase domain. the autoinhibitory sequence (AIS) and the ?CBM. AMP does not have that effect and HDX measurements for myristoylated and non-myristoylated AMPK in the presence of AMP are similar. These differences in dynamics may account for a reduced basal rate of phosphorylation of Thr172 in myristoylated AMPK in skeletal muscle where endogenous ATP concentrations are very high. © The Author(s) 2016.,True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:wBLCggQE-ToC,0,https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/173974,,,,,0

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA. 87: 2284–2288. 1990). The calculated Mr is 107.534 whereas the estimate by SDS-PAGE is approximately 130.000. Gibson and Higgins (DNA Sequence (in press)) have recently reported the possibility of errors in the cDNA sequence for non-muscle MLCK and that the NH2-terminus of both it and smMLCK may extend beyond the reported coding region. The native smMLCK is NH2-terminally blocked. A CNBr peptide derived from smMLCK contains the NH2-terminal sequence Asp-Phe-Arg-Ala corresponding to residues 2 to 4 in the smMLCK sequence indicating that Met-1 is present. Using a limited thermolysin digest we isolated an NH.-terminally blocked peptide by reversed-phase HPLC. This thermolytic peptide had a mass of approximately 797 by time of flight mass spectrometry. Amino acid analysis and Edman sequencing of a CNBr-subfragment of the thermolytic peptide indicated that it had the composition and sequence.(Met)-Asp-Phe-Arg-Ala-Asn. with a calculated mass of 753. The difference in mass corresponds to the NH2-terminal Met being blocked by acetylation. The results demonstrate that the NH2-terminal sequence of smMLCK inferred from the reported cDNA sequence is correct and that the proposed initiating Met is not removed. but modified by O-NH2 acetylation of the translation product.(Mol Cell Biochem 127/128: 81–91. 1993),True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:1r-w4gtu6w8C,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BCroBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA81&dq=info:AWcRTKP9lNoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=UaIB3m7BKY&sig=_5F3Mt4tsauzyP7q9G4zvMkW46Q,,,,,0

Substrates of PKA appear to be involved with a wider range of biological processes than those of PKG. and some processes. such as nucleic acid metabolism. are more prevalent in PKG substrates. Protein crystal structures have revealed that protein kinases have extended grooves to accommodate the protein substrate sequence around the target phosphorylation site. Residues in the substrate sequence make contact with amino acid residues in the protein kinase substrate binding groove termed substrate-determining residues (SDRs). and so determine which substrates are preferred to bind to …,True,NKBxL1gAAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123741455001820,,,,,0

Their importance is further reflected in the fact that phosphorylation is the most abundant type of cellular regulation. affecting essentially every cellular process. including metabolism. growth. differentiation. motility. membrane transport. learning. and memory. Protein kinase can be regulated in diverse ways. ranging from transcriptional control through subcellular localization and recruitment of substrates. to structural and chemical modifications of the proteins themselves. The specificity in the cell is determined by a combination of “peptide specificity” of the kinase. substrate recruitment. and phosphatase activity.

Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) reverses obesity by promoting the preferential loss of white adipose tissue. We evaluated the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CNTF regulates adiposity. Obese mice fed a high fat diet were treated with saline (HFD) or recombinant CNTF for 10 days and adipose tissue was removed for analysis. Another group fed a HFD were pair fed (PF) to CNTF mice. In separate experiments 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with CNTF to examine metabolic responses and signaling. CNTF reduced adipose mass that resulted from reductions in adipocyte area and triglyceride content. CNTF treatment did not affect lipolysis but resulted in decreases in fat esterification and lipogenesis and enhanced fatty acid oxidation. The enhanced fat oxidation was associated with the expression of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor coactivator1α (PGC1α) and nuclear respiratory factor 1. increases in oxidative phosphorylation subunits and mitochondrial biogenesis as determined by electron microscopy. Studies in cultured adipocytes revealed that CNTF activates p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK). Inhibiting p38 activation prevented the CNTF-induced increase in PGC1α but not AMPK activation. Diminished food intake with PF induced similar decreases in fat mass but this was related to increased expression of uncoupling protein 1.

57292,BRADYKININ STIMULATED ACTIVATION OF AMPK IN ENDOTHELIAL CELLS: A NEW PATHWAY TO REVERSE ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION? 1510,2006,P MOUNT and S Venkatesan and N Lane and F Katsis and B KEMP and D POWER,11,Nephrology,,,,Endothelial dysfunction. the precursor of vascular disease. is associated with lipid accumulation within endothelial cells. The energy-sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates endothelial cell lipid metabolism by phosphorylating and inhibiting both HMGCoA reductase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC); rate limiting enzymes of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis respectively. Bradykinin (BK). the effector molecule of the kinin-kallikrein system. has multiple beneficial effects on endothelial cell function. To determine whether BK regulates AMPK in endothelium. stimulations of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) with BK were performed. BK (10-6 M) caused a marked increase in AMPK activity. which occurred within 30 secs and persisted for 30 mins (p< 0.05). Activation of AMPK by BK was observed with low BK concentrations (10-10 M. p< 0.05). consistent with this being in the physiological range.

57328,CELL AND MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY-Inhibition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator by novel interaction with the metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase,2000,Kenneth R Hallows and Viswanathan Raghuram and Bruce E Kemp and Lee A Witters and J Kevin Foskett,105,Journal of Clinical Investigation,12,1711-1722,[New York. etc.] American Society for Clinical Investigation.,The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-gated Cl- channel that regulates other epithelial transport proteins by uncharacterized mechanisms. We employed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the COOH-terminal 70 residues of CFTR to identify proteins that might be involved in such interactions. The alpha1 (catalytic) subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was identified as a dominant and novel interacting protein. The interaction is mediated by residues 1420-1457 in CFTR and by the COOH-terminal regulatory domain of alpha1-AMPK. Mutations of two protein trafficking motifs within the 38-amino acid region in CFTR each disrupted the interaction. GST-fusion protein pull-down assays in vitro and in transfected cells confirmed the CFTR-alpha1-AMPK interaction and also identified alpha2-AMPK as an interactor with CFTR.

NJ,The reversible phosphorylation of proteins by protein kinases is the most extensively used molecular mechanism regulating cellular functions in eukaryotes. Essentially all major cellular processes. including cell growth and differentiation. motility. metabolism. and communication between cells. are in some way regulated by protein phosphorylation (Fig. 1). It is estimated that approx 30% of all mammalian proteins exist in different phosphorylated forms. To finetune the cellular response to external or internal signals toward such a diversity of substrates. protein kinases themselves must be tightly regulated and be present in a sufficiently large number of diverse forms. It is therefore not surprising that the recent genome sequencing projects revealed that a large proportion of genes code for different protein kinase catalytic subunits.

With the recent explosive growth in the use of mass spectrometry in the structural analysis of proteins and peptides. this approach has also become the method of choice for the elucidation of post-translational modifications. including phosphorylation. Many developments have taken place since early studies using fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) in 1985 (1). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDITOF). electrospray ionization (ESI) triple quadrupole mass spectrometry and its low flow rate version. nano-ESI mass spectrometry. are currently the most widely used forms of instrumentation in these studies. They are both sensitive and highly precise. and this chapter will be confined to these instrumentation types. with which we have practical experience. Hybrid instruments eg Q-TOF (quadrupole time-of-flight) are now available. or in advanced stages of development. from several manufacturers. as well as both electrospray and MALDITOF instruments with Fourier transform detection at the frontiers of precision. Other mass spectrometric analytical methodologies. including ion-trap methods. have been applied to phosphorylation site analysis.

We have determined that PTHrP localizes to the nucleus at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and is transported to the cytoplasm when cells divide. PTHrP contains a putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (residues 61-94) similar to that of SV40 T-antigen. which may be implicated in the nuclear import of the molecule. We identified that Thr85 immediately prior to the NLS of PTHrP was phosphorylated by CDC2-CDK2 and phosphorylation was cell cycle-dependent.

57342,The specific cGMP-dependent protein kinase substrate stop protein. is phosphorylated in nerve terminals,1998,X Wang and PJ Robinson and K Mitchlhill and BE Kemp,9,Proceedings of the Australian Neuroscience Society,,88,,[en] Full text: cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) plays a key role to transducing cGMP action such as neurotransmission. learning and memory and neuronal differentiation. PKG achieves its function by phosphorylating its substrates. Despite its apparent importance. however. remarkably few specific PKG substrates in nerve terminals have been identified. We have demonstrated that there are more than 10 specific PKG substrates in nerve terminals (synaptosomes) of rat brain. Among them. we purified a 130 kDa (P130) protein and identified it as STOP (stable tubule-only polypeptide) protein by protein micro-sequencing. STOP binds to cold stable microtubules and prevents them from disassembly. STOP was phosphorylated by PKG on a serine residue in vitro but not by cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C. The phosphorylation of STOP by PKG only occurred at lower Mg 2+ concentration (1 mM) and not at 3 or 10 mM. STOP was also phosphorylated in living nerve terminals. as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. from 32 Pi-labeled synaptosomes using a synthetic peptide antibody we raised against rat brain STOP. The 32 Pi-labeled STOP from synaptosomes comigrated on SDS gels with purified STOP phosphorylated by PKG in vitro. Studies of the possible effect of cGMP analogues or nitric oxide donor on STOP phosphorylation and neurotransmission are underway. STOP represents the third identified nerve terminal PKG substrates (after G-substrate and DARPP-32) and hence may impact on our understanding of the role of cGMP signalling in neuronal function.

There are multiple genes for each subunit and the rat liver AMPK 1 and 2 catalytic subunits are associated with 1 and 1 noncatalytic subunits. We find that the isolated 1 subunit is N-terminally acetylated with no other posttranslational modification. The isolated 1 subunit is N-terminally myristoylated. Transfection of COS cells with AMPK subunit cDNAs containing a nonmyristoylatable 1 reduces. but does not eliminate. membrane binding of AMPK heterotrimer. The isolated1 subunit is partially phosphorylated at three sites. Ser24/25. Ser182. and Ser108. The Ser24/25 and Ser108 sites are substoichiometrically phosphorylated and can be autophosphorylated in vitro. The Ser-Pro site in the sequence LSSS182PPGP is stoichiometrically phosphorylated. and no additional phosphate is incorporated into this site with autophosphorylation. Based on labeling studies in transfected cells. we conclude that 1 Thr172 is a major. although not exclusive. site of both basal and stimulated 1 phosphorylation by an upstream AMPK kinase.The 5-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 1 isolated from liver consists of three subunits. the catalytic subunit (548 residues. Mr 62.497 63 kDa) and two noncatalytic subunits.(Mr 30.378 40 kDa) and(Mr 37.429 38 kDa)(1–3).
