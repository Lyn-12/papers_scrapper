3,Toll-like receptors,2003,Kiyoshi Takeda and Tsuneyasu Kaisho and Shizuo Akira,21,Annual Reviews,The innate immune system in drosophila and mammals senses the invasion of microorganisms using the family of Toll receptors. stimulation of which initiates a range of host defense mechanisms. In drosophila antimicrobial responses rely on two signaling pathways: the Toll pathway and the IMD pathway. In mammals there are at least 10 members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family that recognize specific components conserved among microorganisms. Activation of the TLRs leads not only to the induction of inflammatory responses but also to the development of antigen-specific adaptive immunity. The TLR-induced inflammatory response is dependent on a common signaling pathway that is mediated by the adaptor molecule MyD88. However. there is evidence for additional pathways that mediate TLR ligand-specific biological responses.,True,0TG2laoAAAAJ:xXdmTUQ9lisC,10559,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.immunol.21.120601.141126,9860043691267068964,/scholar?cites=9860043691267068964,,0

Although TLRs are critical for host defense. it has become apparent that loss of negative regulation of TLR signaling. as well as recognition of self molecules by TLRs. are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

The initial sensing of infection is mediated by innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). which include Toll-like receptors. RIG-I-like receptors. NOD-like receptors. and C-type lectin receptors. The intracellular signaling cascades triggered by these PRRs lead to transcriptional expression of inflammatory mediators that coordinate the elimination of pathogens and infected cells.

TRIF-deficient mice were defective in both TLR3- and TLR4-mediated expression of IFN-β and activation of IRF-3. Furthermore. inflammatory cytokine production in response to the TLR4 ligand. but not to other TLR ligands. was severely impaired in TRIF-deficient macrophages. Mice deficient in both MyD88 and TRIF showed complete loss of nuclear factor kappa B activation in response to TLR4 stimulation.

19,Toll-like receptors and their crosstalk with other innate receptors in infection and immunity,2011,Taro Kawai and Shizuo Akira,34,Cell Press,Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that play a central role in host cell recognition and responses to microbial pathogens. TLR-mediated recognition of components derived from a wide range of pathogens and their role in the subsequent initiation of innate immune responses is widely accepted; however. the recent discovery of non-TLR PRRs. such as C-type lectin receptors. NOD-like receptors. and RIG-I-like receptors. suggests that many aspects of innate immunity are more sophisticated and complex.

TLR signaling pathways arise from intracytoplasmic TIR domains. which are conserved among all TLRs. Recent accumulating evidence has demonstrated that TIR domain-containing adaptors. such as MyD88.

24,Unresponsiveness of MyD88-deficient mice to endotoxin,1999,Taro Kawai and Osamu Adachi and Tomohiko Ogawa and Kiyoshi Takeda and Shizuo Akira,11,Cell Press,MyD88 is a general adaptor protein that plays an important role in the Toll/IL-1 receptor family signalings. Recently. Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2 and TLR4) have been suggested to be the signaling receptors for lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study. we demonstrate that MyD88 knockout mice lack the ability to respond to LPS as measured by shock response. B cell proliferative response. and secretion of cytokines by macrophages and embryonic fibroblasts. However. activation of neither NF-κB nor the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family is abolished in MyD88 knockout mice. These findings demonstrate that signaling via MyD88 is essential for LPS response. but the inability of MyD88 knockout mice to induce LPS-dependent gene expression cannot simply be attributed to lack of the activation of MAP kinases and NF-κB.,True,0TG2laoAAAAJ:lu5AzqVF4qYC,2481,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761300800862,16071753484175611253,/scholar?cites=16071753484175611253,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761300800862,0

Increases in interferon-γ production and natural killer cell activity in response to IL-18 are abrogated. In vivo Th1 response is also impaired. Furthermore. IL-18-induced activation of NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is blocked in MyD88−/− Th1-developing cells.

28,Pathogen recognition by the innate immune system,2011,Himanshu Kumar and Taro Kawai and Shizuo Akira,30,Taylor & Francis,Microbial infection initiates complex interactions between the pathogen and the host. Pathogens express several signature molecules. known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). which are essential for survival and pathogenicity. PAMPs are sensed by evolutionarily conserved. germline-encoded host sensors known as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). Recognition of PAMPs by PRRs rapidly triggers an array of anti-microbial immune responses through the induction of various inflammatory cytokines. chemokines and type I interferons. These responses also initiate the development of pathogen-specific. long-lasting adaptive immunity through B and T lymphocytes. Several families of PRRs. including Toll-like receptors (TLRs).

29,Signaling to NF-κB by Toll-like receptors,2007,Taro Kawai and Shizuo Akira,13,Elsevier Current Trends,Innate immunity is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. A family of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) acts as primary sensors that detect a wide variety of microbial components and elicit innate immune responses. All TLR signaling pathways culminate in activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB). which controls the expression of an array of inflammatory cytokine genes. NF-κB activation requires the phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory κB (IκB) proteins. which is triggered by two kinases. IκB kinase α (IKKα) and IKKβ. In addition. several TLRs activate alternative pathways involving the IKK-related kinases TBK1 [TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK) binding kinase-1] and IKKi. which elicit antiviral innate immune responses.
