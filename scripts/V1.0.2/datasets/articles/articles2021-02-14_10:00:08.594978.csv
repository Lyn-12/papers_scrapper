Upon receipt of a proinflammatory stimulus. an upstream adaptor. RIP2. binds and oligomerizes caspase-1 zymogen. promoting its autoactivation. ICEBERG is a novel protein that inhibits generation of IL-1β by interacting with caspase-1 and preventing its association with RIP2. ICEBERG is induced by proinflammatory stimuli. suggesting that it may be part of a negative feedback loop. Consistent with this. enforced retroviral expression of ICEBERG inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-1β generation. The structure of ICEBERG reveals it to be a member of the death-domain-fold superfamily.

RIP2 and RIP3 are related kinases that share extensive sequence homology with the kinase domain of RIP. Unlike RIP. which has a C-terminal death domain. and RIP2. which has a C-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain. RIP3 possesses a unique C terminus.

The  innovation of water oxidation freed photosynthesis to invade new  environments and visibly changed the face of the Earth.

Like any other GPCRs. class‐C receptors possess a heptahelical domain (HD) involved in heterotrimeric G‐protein activation. but most of them also have a large extracellular domain (ECD) responsible for agonist recognition and binding. In addition. it is now well accepted that these receptors are dimers. either homo or heterodimers. This complex architecture raises a number of important questions. Here we will discuss our view of how agonist binding within the large ECD triggers the necessary change of conformation. or stabilize a specific conformation. of the heptahelical domain …,True,gbn_qSYAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,126,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1768-322X.2004.tb01423.x,2207810408315786134,/scholar?cites=2207810408315786134,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1768-322X.2004.tb01423.x,0,0,0

123425,Molecular evolution of bacterial β-lactam resistance,1996,James R Knox and Paul C Moews and Jean-Marie Frere,3,Chemistry & biology,11,937-947,Cell Press,Background: Two groups of penicillin-destroying enzymes. the class A and class C β-lactamases. may have evolved from bacterial transpeptidases that transfer x-d-Ala-d-Ala peptides to the growing peptidoglycan during cell wall synthesis. Both the transpeptidases and the β-lactamases are acylated by β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin. which mimic the peptide. but breakdown and removal of the antibiotic is much faster in the β-lactamases. which lack the ability to process d-Ala-d-Ala peptides. Stereochemical factors driving this evolution in specificity are examined. Results: We have compared the crystal structures of two classes of β-lactamases and a β-lactam-sensitive d-alanyl-d-alanine-carboxypeptidase/transpeptidase (DD-peptidase). The class C β-lactamase is more similar to the DD-peptidase than to another β-lactamase of class A.

The existence of both ferrous and ferric ions in low- and high-spin configuration. as well as the ability of the metal to function over a wide range of redox potentials. contributes to its unique versatility. Not surprisingly. the singular attributes of iron that permit it to be so useful to life likewise render the metal dangerous to manipulate and to sequester.All vertebrate animals are prone to tissue damage from exposure to excess iron.

Under normal conditions there is no regulatory and rapid iron excretion in humans and body iron levels are mainly regulated from the absorption of iron from the gut. Regular blood transfusions in thalassaemia and other chronic refractory anaemias can result in excessive iron deposition in tissues and organs.

A study of two eye lens crystallins.,1993,Manni Luthra and D Balasubramanian,268,Journal of Biological Chemistry,24,18119-18127,Elsevier,We have investigated the effect of nonenzymatic glycation (fructation) in vitro on the structure and stability of two proteins that are glycated in vivo as a consequence of high endogenous levels of sugar. We find that whereas fructation leads to the structural destabilization of the monomeric gamma-crystallin from the core of the eye lens. it leads to an increase in stability in the multimeric alpha-crystallin of the lens cortex. Thus. while glycated gamma-crystallin shows (a) a longer wavelength of fluorescent emission. indicating a greater exposure of its aromatic side chains to the medium; (b) a reduced secondary structural content; and (c) a more facile denaturation by thermodynamic and chemical means. alpha-crystallin displays the opposite behavior.

123461,Essential oils as green pesticides: potential and constraints,2008,Opender Koul and Suresh Walia and GS Dhaliwal,4,Biopesticides international,1,63-84,,Many plant essential oils show a broad spectrum of activity against pest insects and plant pathogenic fungi ranging from insecticidal. antifeedant. repellent. oviposition deterrent. growth regulatory and antivector activities. These oils also have a long tradition of use in the protection of stored products. Recent investigations indicate that some chemical constituents of these oils interfere with the octopaminergic nervous system in insects. As this target site is not shared with mammals. most essential oil chemicals are relatively non-toxic to mammals and fish in toxicological tests. and meet the criteria for “reduced risk” pesticides. Some of these oils and their constituent chemicals are widely used as flavoring agents in foods and beverages and are even exempt from pesticide registration. This special regulatory status combined with the wide availability of essential oils from the flavor and fragrance industries. has made it possible to fasttrack commercialization of essential oil-based pesticides. Though well received by consumers for use against home and garden pests. these “green pesticides” can also prove effective in agricultural situations. particularly for organic food production. Further. while resistance development continues to be an issue for many synthetic pesticides. it is likely that resistance will develop more slowly to essential-oil-based pesticides owing to the complex mixtures of constituents that characterize many of these oils.

Among 12 samples of neem oil analyzed by liquid chromatography. azadirachtin concentrations ranged from< 50 (limit of detec-tion) to over 4000 ppm.

For each of the three bioassays. bioactivity of the oils. as measured by EC50 values. is highly correlated with azadirachtin content of the oils. From 72% to 90% of the variation in bioactivity of the oils can be accounted for by variation in azadirachtincontent.

In this Opinion article. we illustrate that for six major nutrient ions. in addition to influx mediation by low-affinity transporters. high rates of ion cycling at the plasma membrane are a hallmark of nutrient transport at elevated external concentrations.

We distinguish between changes observed in the apoplast (i.e. suberization. lignification. and silicification of the extracellular matrix; transpirational bypass flow of solutes and water). and those of the symplast (i.e. transmembrane transport of solutes and water; gene expression; oxidative stress; metabolism). and discuss these features in the context of Si biogeochemistry and bioavailability in agricultural soils. evaluating the prospect of using Si fertilization to increase crop yield and stress tolerance under salinity and drought conditions.,True,urWlLlQAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,151,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01072/full,18064117589700633015,/scholar?cites=18064117589700633015,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01072/full,0,0,0

Despite reduced oxygen consumption and PO2 during estivation. which should also mean reduced production of oxyradicals. the activities of antioxidant enzymes. such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. increased in 30 day-estivating snails.

This new electronic criterion of aromaticity is based on the fact that aromaticity is related to the cyclic delocalized distribution of π‐electrons. We have found that this DI and the harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) index are strongly correlated for a series of six‐membered rings in eleven planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The correlation between the DI and the nucleus‐independent chemical shift (NICS) values is less remarkable. although in general six‐membered rings with larger DI values also have more negative NICS indices.

A Wiley Company,Aromaticity is a central chemical concept widely used in modern chemistry for the interpretation of molecular structure. stability. reactivity. and magnetic properties of many compounds. As such. its reliable prediction is an important task of computational chemistry. In recent years. many methods to quantify aromaticity based on different physicochemical properties of molecules have been proposed. However. the nonobservable nature of aromaticity makes difficult to assess the performance of the numerous existing indices. In the present work. we introduce a series of fifteen aromaticity tests that can be used to analyze the advantages and drawbacks of a group of aromaticity descriptors.

Comparison of the nucleotide sequences showed that the introns are much more homologous than the protein-coding regions of exons except for the signal peptide-coding region of the first exon. The numbers of nucleotide substitutions per site (KN) for introns are approximately one-fourth of the numbers of nucleotide substitutions per synonymous site (KS) for the protein-coding regions. indicating that the introns are unusually conserved.

We have solved the structure of the prototypic SH2-kinase unit of the human Fes tyrosine kinase. which appears specialized for positive signaling. In its active conformation. the SH2 domain tightly interacts with the kinase N-terminal lobe and positions the kinase αC helix in an active configuration through essential packing and electrostatic interactions. This interaction is stabilized by ligand binding to the SH2 domain.

123538,A simplified method for the analysis of hydroxyproline in biological tissues,1996,G Kesava Reddy and Chukuka S Enwemeka,29,Clinical biochemistry,3,225-229,Elsevier,A critical study of the different steps involved in previous procedure for hydroxyproline assay allows the direct measurement of collagen content in tissue homogenates without losing the advantages of the method. The procedure is based on alkaline hydrolysis of the tissue homogenate and subsequent determination of the free hydroxyproline in hydrolyzates. Chloramine-T was used to oxidize the free hydroxyproline for the production of a pyrrole. The addition of Ehrlich's reagent resulted in the formation of a chromophore that can be measured at 550 nm. Optimal assay conditions were determined using tissue homogenate and purified acid soluble collagen along with standard hydroxyproline. Critical parameters such as the amount of chloramine-T. sodium hydroxide. p-dimethylaminobenzaidehyde. pH of the reaction buffer. and length of oxidation time were examined to obtain satisfactory results.

Background: Cold packs are commonly used by clinicians. trainers. and others. often as an interim treatment for many acute conditions. but the extent of temperature change associated with this form of treatment remains poorly understood. Methods: In 16 healthy male and female volunteers aged 25.4 3.6 yr. we monitored skin temperature. and recorded the temperature of the quadriceps muscle at 1. 2. and 3 cm depths below the skin. before. during. and after 20 min of cold pack treatment. Results: The results revealed a slight rise in temperature at all four levels during the 5 min pretreatment period. but significant temperature falls at the skin and 1 cm levels beginning from 8 min of treatment (P 0.001). There was no significant change in tissue temperature at the 2.0 cm or 3.0 cm depths throughout treatment. However. after treatment. cutaneous temperature and the temperature at 1.0 cm depth rose rapidly. returning to baseline levels at variable intersubject times. As these superficial temperatures rose. there were concurrent falls in the temperatures at the 2.0 cm and 3.0 cm levels. Thus. the deeper tissues lost heat (cooled) simultaneously as the superficial tissues rewarmed; to the extent that 40 min after treatment. the deeper levels were cooler than the cutaneous and 1.0 cm levels.

Normally. stolons develop only from axillaries located below the soil surface and it is shown that darkness and a moist atmosphere favour stolon emergence. However. all axillaries subject to apical dominance are potentially capable of emerging as stolons. as shown by the fact that maintaining the axillaries of aerial shoots under conditions of darkness and humidity by ‘aerial layering’results in their emergence as stolons. In rooted stem cuttings. basal axillaries not subject to apical dominance grow as leafy shoots. but if the roots are removed they develop as stolons. Thus. axillary shoots not subject to apical dominance are converted from stolons into leafy shoots by some influence of the roots.

Under unstressed conditions. Nrf2 is constantly ubiquitinated by the Cul3–Keap1 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex and rapidly degraded in proteasomes. Upon exposure to electrophilic and oxidative stresses. reactive cysteine residues of Keap1 become modified. leading to a decline in the E3 ligase activity. stabilization of Nrf2 and robust induction of a battery of cytoprotective genes. Biochemical and structural analyses have revealed that the intact Keap1 homodimer forms a cherry‐bob structure in which one molecule of Nrf2 associates with two molecules of Keap1 by using two binding sites within the Neh2 domain of Nrf2.

Studies in which the mammalian Smad homologs were transiently overexpressed in cultured cells have implicated Smad2 in TGF-β signaling. but the physiological relevance of the Smad3 protein in signaling by TGF-β receptors has not been established. Here we stably expressed Smad proteins at controlled levels in epithelial cells using a novel approach that combines highly efficient retroviral gene transfer and quantitative cell sorting. We show that upon TGF-β treatment Smad3 becomes rapidly phosphorylated at the SSVS motif at its very C terminus.

TGF-β induces phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad3. We describe here the association of Smad3 with the nuclear protooncogene protein Ski in response to the activation of TGF-β signaling. Association with Ski represses transcriptional activation by Smad3. and overexpression of Ski renders cells resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-β. The transcriptional repression as well as the growth resistance to TGF-β by overexpression of Ski can be overcome by overexpression of Smad3.

Some TGF-β-initiated signals are conveyed through Smad3; TGF-β binding to its receptors induces phosphorylation of Smad3. which then migrates to the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor. We describe here the association of Smad3 with the nuclear protooncogene protein SnoN. Overexpression of SnoN represses transcriptional activation by Smad3. Activation of TGF-β signaling leads to rapid degradation of SnoN and. to a lesser extent. of the related Ski protein. and this degradation is likely mediated by cellular proteasomes.

Proteins involved in TGF-β signaling are bona fide tumor suppressors and many tumor cells acquire the ability to escape TGF-β growth inhibition through the loss of key signaling transducers in the pathway or through the activation of oncogenes. Recent studies indicate that there is a specific connection between the TGF-β signaling pathway and the Ski/SnoN family of oncoproteins.

It is not fully understood how the baseline properties of Smad3 are regulated. although this molecule is in complex with many other proteins at the steady state.

However. it also showed excellent copper-chelating activity. In vitro. chitosan acted as an inducer mainly of monohydrate CaOx crystal formation. which is more prevalent in patients with urolithiasis. We also observed that chitosan modifies the morphology and size of these crystals. as well as changes the surface charge of the crystals. making them even more positive. which can facilitate the interaction of these crystals with renal cells.

However. the molecular mechanisms by which these stress signals are perceived and transduced are poorly understood. To begin to identify primary stress signal transduction components. we have focused on genes that respond rapidly (within 5 min) to stress signals. Because it has been hypothesized that detection of physical stress is a mechanism common to mounting a response against a broad range of environmental stresses. we have utilized mechanical wounding as the stress stimulus and performed whole genome microarray analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana leaf tissue. This led to the identification of a number of rapid wound responsive (RWR) genes. Comparison of RWR genes with published abiotic and biotic stress microarray datasets demonstrates a large overlap across a wide range of environmental stresses. Interestingly. RWR genes also exhibit a striking level and pattern of circadian regulation. with induced and repressed genes displaying antiphasic rhythms. Using bioinformatic analysis. we identified a novel motif overrepresented in the promoters of RWR genes. herein designated as the Rapid Stress Response Element (RSRE). We demonstrate in transgenic plants that multimerized RSREs are sufficient to confer a rapid response to both biotic and abiotic stresses in vivo. thereby establishing the functional involvement of this motif in primary transcriptional stress responses.

The worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes has been stimulating the quest for new concepts and targets for the treatment of this incurable disease. A new target is glycogen phosphorylase (GP). the main regulatory enzyme in the liver responsible for the control of blood glucose levels. One of several approaches to influence the action of GP is the use of glucose derivatives as active site inhibitors. This field of research commenced 10-15 years ago and. due to joint efforts in computer aided molecular design. organic synthesis. protein crystallography. and biological assays. resulted in glucopyranosylidene-spiro-hydantoin 16 (Ki = 3-4 μM) as the most efficient glucose analog inhibitor of GP of that time.

Timer is a derivative of the DsRed fluorescent protein that changes from green to red over time and. hence. can be used to distinguish new from old elastin. Using dynamic imaging microscopy. we found that the first step in elastic fiber formation is the appearance of small cell surface‐associated elastin globules that increased in size with time (microassembly). The elastin globules are eventually transferred to pre‐existing elastic fibers in the extracellular matrix where they coalesce into larger structures (macroassembly).

123712,Organic acids: the pools of fixed carbon involved in redox regulation and energy balance in higher plants,2016,Abir U Igamberdiev and Alexander T Eprintsev,7,,,1042,Frontiers,Organic acids are synthesized in plants as a result of the incomplete oxidation of photosynthetic products and represent the stored pools of fixed carbon accumulated due to different transient times of conversion of carbon compounds in metabolic pathways. When redox level in the cell increases. e.g.. in conditions of active photosynthesis. the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in mitochondria is transformed to a partial cycle supplying citrate for the synthesis of 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate (citrate valve). while malate is accumulated and participates in the redox balance in different cell compartments (via malate valve). This results in malate and citrate frequently being the most accumulated acids in plants. However. the intensity of reactions linked to the conversion of these compounds can cause preferential accumulation of other organic acids. e.g.. fumarate or isocitrate. in higher concentrations than malate and citrate. The secondary reactions. associated with the central metabolic pathways. in particularly with the TCA cycle. result in accumulation of other organic acids that are derived from the intermediates of the cycle. They form the additional pools of fixed carbon and stabilize the TCA cycle. Trans-aconitate is formed from citrate or cis-aconitate. accumulation of hydroxycitrate can be linked to metabolism of 2-oxoglutarate. while 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate can be formed from pyruvate and glyoxylate.

Many of the principles and characteristics of protein folding have been learned by studying refolding of denatured polypeptides. However. the problem of protein folding cannot be completely understood without reference to the biological context of protein folding. especially for large. multidomain. and multisubunit proteins. One of the basic differences between biosynthetic protein folding and protein renaturation is cotranslational folding. folding that occurs during synthesis. The elegant idea that the process of protein folding is concomitant with synthesis was articulated. and experimental testing was begun in the early 1960s (1. 2). Today there is substantial experimental support for the cotranslational folding hypothesis. Both cotranslational and cotranslocational folding. at least when the latter is coupled to translation. share the basic feature of vectorial appearance of the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome or the membrane and the potential initiation of the folding process by the emerging polypeptide. It is true that the same conformations are achieved by polypeptides folded in cells as a consequence of biosynthetic processes and as a result of refolding of the full-length polypeptide from the denatured state. However. identity of the final protein structures does not necessarily mean identity of the pathways leading to their formation (3).

A new crystal form of luciferase cloned from Vibrio harveyi has been grown under low-salt concentrations. which diffract x-rays beyond 1.5-Å resolution. The x-ray structure of bacterial luciferase has been refined to a conventional R-factor of 18.2% for all recorded synchrotron data between 30.0 and 1.50-Å resolution. Bacterial luciferase is an α-β heterodimer. and the individual subunits fold into a single domain (β/α)8 barrel. The high resolution structure reveals a non-prolyl cis peptide bond that forms between Ala74 and Ala75 in the α subunit near the putative active site. This cis peptide bond may have functional significance for creating a cavity at the active site. Bacterial luciferase employs reduced flavin as a substrate rather than a cofactor.

It is now becoming clear that many other bacteria. including animal and plant pathogens. use an autoinduction mechanism to regulate a variety of functions. Cell‐density‐dependent gene expression provides an excellent example of multicellular behaviour in the prokaryotic kingdom where a single cell is able to communicate and sense when a minimal population unit. a ‘quorum’ of bacteria. is achieved in order for certain behaviour of the population to be performed efficiently. Regulation of bacterial bioluminescence has been studied for many years and represents the best model system for understanding the mechanism of cell‐density‐dependent gene expression.

It has recently been shown that many prokaryotes are also capable of modulating growth. and in some cases sensing cell density. by production of extracellular signaling molecules. thereby allowing single celled prokaryotes to function in some respects as multicellular organisms. As Escherichia coli shifts from exponential growth to stationary growth. many changes occur. including cell division leading to formation of short minicells and expression of numerous genes not expressed in exponential phase. An understanding of the coordination between the morphological changes associated with cell division and the physiological and metabolic changes is of fundamental importance to understanding regulation of the prokaryotic cell cycle.

Given the explosive development of molecular biology techniques for gene manipulation and functional selection. genetic approaches for enzyme design are currently in wide use. However. chemical methods provide a means for introducing a diverse range of functionality that does not occur in natural enzymes and cannot be easily incorporated by genetic methods. Thus. chemical modification of proteins remains a valuable tool for protein engineering. This article reviews a variety of approaches in which chemical modification has been used to alter the catalytic properties of existing enzymes to give new catalytic activities to existing enzymes or to impart catalytic activities to proteins normally devoid of enzymatic activity.

123741,Site-specific PEGylation of therapeutic proteins,2015,Jonathan K Dozier and Mark D Distefano,16,,10,25831-25864,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The use of proteins as therapeutics has a long history and is becoming ever more common in modern medicine. While the number of protein-based drugs is growing every year. significant problems still remain with their use. Among these problems are rapid degradation and excretion from patients. thus requiring frequent dosing. which in turn increases the chances for an immunological response as well as increasing the cost of therapy. One of the main strategies to alleviate these problems is to link a polyethylene glycol (PEG) group to the protein of interest. This process. called PEGylation. has grown dramatically in recent years resulting in several approved drugs. Installing a single PEG chain at a defined site in a protein is challenging. Recently. there is has been considerable research into various methods for the site-specific PEGylation of proteins. This review seeks to summarize that work and provide background and context for how site-specific PEGylation is performed. After introducing the topic of site-specific PEGylation. recent developments using chemical methods are described.

Vγ2Vδ2 T cells are stimulated by self- and foreign prenyl pyrophosphate intermediates in isoprenoid synthesis. However. little is known about the molecular basis for this stimulation.

Here we demonstrate a key interaction between these proteins occurs between the C terminus of the transducin α-subunit (GTα) and a hydrophobic cleft in the rhodopsin cytoplasmic face exposed during receptor activation. We mapped this interaction by labeling rhodopsin mutants with the fluorescent probe bimane and then assessed how binding of a peptide analogue of the GTα C terminus (containing a tryptophan quenching group) affected their fluorescence. From these and other assays. we conclude that the GTα C-terminal tail binds to the inner face of helix 6 in a retinal-linked manner.

Such category-specific dictionaries encode subtle visual differences among different categories. while the shared dictionary encodes common visual patterns among all the categories. To this end. we impose incoherence constraints among the different dictionaries in the objective of feature coding. In addition. to make the learnt dictionary stable. we also impose the constraint that each dictionary should be self-incoherent. Our proposed dictionary learning formulation not only applies to fine-grained classification. but also improves conventional basic-level object categorization and other tasks such as event recognition.

These enzymes have been identified and characterized from numerous plant and animal sources. and it is likely that a limited number of bacterial organisms also utilize this catalyst. The biological roles of this enzyme are diverse. including bone resorption. microbial killing and possibly iron transport in animals. and phosphate acquisition in plants.

Cofilin binding lowers the persistence length ∼5-fold to a value of 2.2 μm and the filament flexural rigidity to 0.0091 pN μm2. That cofilin-decorated filaments are more flexible than native filaments despite an increased mass indicates that cofilin binding weakens and redistributes stabilizing subunit interactions of filaments. We favor a mechanism in which the increased flexibility of cofilin-decorated filaments results from the linked dissociation of filament-stabilizing ions and reorganization of actin subdomain 2 and as a consequence promotes severing due to a mechanical asymmetry.

Using optical trapping nanometry with high spatiotemporal resolution. we discovered that there are two possible pathways for the 36-nm steps. one with 12-and 24-nm substeps. in this order. and the other without substeps. Based on the analyses of effects of ATP. ADP and 2. 3-butanedione 2-monoxime (a reagent shown here to slow ADP release from actomyosin V) on the dwell time and the occurrence frequency of the main and the intermediate states. we propose that the 12-nm substep occurs after ATP binding to the bound trailing head and the 24-nm substep results from a mechanical step following the isomerization of an actomyosin-ADP state on the bound leading head.

Filament binding is cooperative and stoichiometric (i.e. one cofilin molecule per actin subunit) for both actin isoforms. The Hill coefficient for binding to βγ-actin filaments (nH=3.5) is greater than for muscle actin (nH=2.3). Analysis of equilibrium binding using a nearest-neighbor cooperativity model indicates that the intrinsic affinities for binding to an isolated site are comparable (10–14 μM) for both filament isoforms but the cooperative free energy is greater for binding βγ-actin filaments. The predicted cofilin cluster sizes and filament binding densities are small at concentrations of cofilin where efficient filament severing is observed. indicating that a few bound cofilin molecules are sufficient to destabilize the filament lattice and …,True,Xi6wOjIAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,147,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283604015360,6359748675367826721,/scholar?cites=6359748675367826721,,,0,0,0

Anammox catabolism most likely resides in a special cell organelle. the anammoxosome. which is surrounded by highly unusual ladder-like (ladderane) lipids.

The newly discovered bacterium Candidatus ‘Methylomirabilis oxyfera’ challenges this dichotomy. This bacterium performs anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification. but does so in a peculiar way. Instead of scavenging oxygen from the environment. like the aerobic methanotrophs. or driving methane oxidation by reverse methanogenesis. like the methanogenic archaea in sulfate-reducing systems. it produces its own supply of oxygen by metabolizing nitrite via nitric oxide into oxygen and dinitrogen gas. The intracellularly produced oxygen is then used for the oxidation of methane by the classical aerobic methane oxidation pathway involving methane mono-oxygenase.

The intermediates involved in this reduction process remain bound to a series of typical C1-carriers. Reducing equivalents are either obtained from the oxidation of H2 or from oxidation of carbon substrates to CO2. Electron transfer reactions thus constitute the very essence of the process of methanogenesis.In recent years much progress has been made in the elucidation of the special metabolic pathways and the nature of the C1-carriers involved in methanogenic bacteria.

While the B. subtilis pbuE riboswitch fully depends on co-transcriptional binding of adenine to function. the V. vulnificus add riboswitch can bind to adenine after transcription is completed and still perform translation regulation. Further investigation demonstrates that the rate of transcription is critical for the B. subtilis pbuE riboswitch to perform efficiently. which is in agreement with a co-transcriptional regulation.

Bezafibrate. a hypolipidemic drug was used as a reference compound for data comparison. Treatment of rats with single and combined hypercholesterolemia with quinazolinone compounds gave rise to highly significant reductions in serum total cholesterol and cholesterol ester levels. whereas serum triacylglycerol level was significantly reduced only after treatment with halogen-substituted quinazolinones in single hyper-cholesterolemia. compared to the control group. The effects of different quinazolinones and bezafibrate on reduction of serum LDL-C level were comparable in single hypercholesterolemia but significantly different in combined hypercholesterolemia.

The inhibition mechanism has been studied by conducting electrochemical polarisation measurements. The inhibitor acts by covering the cathodic area of the metal surface through adsorption of the phosphorus atom. A synergistic effect has been observed for KBr.

The origins of this DNA damage could. in principle. involve: (i) abortive apoptosis initiated post meiotically when the ability to drive this process to completion is in decline (ii) unresolved strand breaks created during spermiogenesis to relieve the torsional stresses associated with chromatin remodelling and (iii) oxidative stress. In this article. we present a two-step hypothesis for the origins of DNA damage in human spermatozoa that highlights the significance of oxidative stress acting on vulnerable. poorly protaminated cells generated as a result of defective spermiogenesis.

The significance of mobile phone radiation on male reproduction is a key element of this debate since several studies have suggested a relationship between mobile phone use and semen quality. The potential mechanisms involved have not been established. however. human spermatozoa are known to be particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress by virtue of the abundant availability of substrates for free radical attack and the lack of cytoplasmic space to accommodate antioxidant enzymes. Moreover. the induction of oxidative stress in these cells not only perturbs their capacity for fertilization but also contributes to sperm DNA damage. The latter has. in turn. been linked with poor fertility. an increased incidence of miscarriage and morbidity in the offspring. including childhood cancer. In light of these associations. we have analyzed the influence of RF-EMR on the cell biology of human spermatozoa in vitro.  Principal Findings Purified human spermatozoa were exposed to radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) tuned to 1.8 GHz and covering a range of specific absorption rates (SAR) from 0.4 W/kg to 27.5 W/kg. In step with increasing SAR. motility and vitality were significantly reduced after RF-EMR exposure. while the mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species and DNA fragmentation were significantly elevated (P<0.001). Furthermore. we also observed highly significant relationships between SAR. the oxidative DNA damage bio-marker. 8-OH-dG. and DNA fragmentation after RF-EMR exposure …,True,hYVlw_YAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,487,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006446,793588973225252965,/scholar?cites=793588973225252965,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006446,0,0,0

This damage is poorly characterized. but is known to involve hypomethylation of key genes. oxidative base damage. endonuclease-mediated cleavage and the formation of adducts with xenobiotics and the products of lipid peroxidation.

The origins of such oxidative stress appear to involve the sperm mitochondria. which have a tendency to generate high levels of superoxide anion as a prelude to entering the intrinsic apoptotic cascade. Unfortunately. these cells have very little capacity to respond to such an attack because they only possess the first enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1).

Two classes of these enzymes have been identified. based on the mode of ring cleavage: intradiol dioxygenases utilize non-heme Fe(III) to cleave the aromatic nucleus ortho to the hydroxyl substituents; and extradiol dioxygenases utilize non-heme Fe(II) or other divalent metal ions to cleave the aromatic nucleus meta to the hydroxyl substituents. Recent genomic. structural. spectroscopic. and kinetic studies have increased our understanding of the distribution. evolution. and mechanisms of these enzymes.

Generally it has been observed that altering the cellular content of sphingomyelin or cholesterol results in corresponding changes in mass and/or synthesis of the other lipid. In the case of cholesterol synthesis and trafficking. SM regulates the capacity of membranes to absorb cholesterol and thereby controls sterol flux between the plasma membrane and regulatory pathways in the endoplasmic reticulum. This relationship exemplifies the importance of cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich domains in cholesterol homeostasis. as well as other aspects of cell signaling and transport.

This provides rapidly dividing cells with the necessary precursors for membrane. protein and nucleic acid synthesis. A fundamental metabolic perturbation in cancer is the enhanced synthesis of fatty acids by channeling glucose and/or glutamine into cytosolic acetyl-CoA and upregulation of key biosynthetic genes. This lipogenic phenotype also extends to the production of complex lipids involved in membrane synthesis and lipid-based signaling.

It is believed that the SCN clock entrains the phase of peripheral clocks via chemical cues. such as rhythmically secreted hormones. Here we show that temporal feeding restriction under light–dark or dark–dark conditions can change the phase of circadian gene expression in peripheral cell types by up to 12 h while leaving the phase of cyclic gene expression in the SCN unaffected. Hence. changes in metabolism can lead to an uncoupling of peripheral oscillators from the central pacemaker. Sudden large changes in feeding time. similar to abrupt changes in the photoperiod. reset the phase of rhythmic gene expression gradually and are thus likely to act through a clock-dependent mechanism.

123958,System-driven and oscillator-dependent circadian transcription in mice with a conditionally active liver clock,2007,Benoît Kornmann and Olivier Schaad and Hermann Bujard and Joseph S Takahashi and Ueli Schibler,5,PLoS Biol,2,e34,Public Library of Science,The mammalian circadian timing system consists of a master pacemaker in neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and clocks of a similar molecular makeup in most peripheral body cells. Peripheral oscillators are self-sustained and cell autonomous. but they have to be synchronized by the SCN to ensure phase coherence within the organism. In principle. the rhythmic expression of genes in peripheral organs could thus be driven not only by local oscillators. but also by circadian systemic signals. To discriminate between these mechanisms. we engineered a mouse strain with a conditionally active liver clock. in which REV-ERBα represses the transcription of the essential core clock gene Bmal1 in a doxycycline-dependent manner. We examined circadian liver gene expression genome-wide in mice in which hepatocyte oscillators were either running or arrested. and found that the rhythmic transcription of most genes depended on functional hepatocyte clocks. However. we discovered 31 genes. including the core clock gene mPer2. whose expression oscillated robustly irrespective of whether the liver clock was running or not. By contrast. in liver explants cultured in vitro. circadian cycles of mPer2::luciferase bioluminescence could only be observed when hepatocyte oscillators were operational. Hence. the circadian cycles observed in the liver of intact animals without functional hepatocyte oscillators were likely generated by systemic signals. The finding that rhythmic mPer2 expression can be driven by both systemic cues and local oscillators suggests a plausible mechanism for the phase entrainment of subsidiary clocks in peripheral …,True,Z6ej1jMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,625,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050034,4544989913410766718,/scholar?cites=4544989913410766718,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050034,0,0,0

They provide an appropriate milieu for the catalysis of many biochemical reactions. and they must establish physical links to communicate and exchange metabolites throughout the cell. Interorganelle communication is an important. yet still poorly understood. aspect of cell biology. We recently identified a protein complex that we refer to as ERMES [endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria encounter structure]. the main function of which is to provide a tethering force between the ER and the mitochondria. This complex. composed of both ER and mitochondrial transmembrane proteins. is located at the interface of the two organelles and serves to zipper them together.

Despite its importance. most of the enzymes that synthesize xylan have yet to be identified. Xylans have a backbone of β-1.4–linked xylose residues with substitutions that include α-(1→2)–linked glucuronosyl. 4-O-methyl glucuronosyl. and α-1.2- and α-1.3-arabinofuranosyl residues. The substitutions are structurally diverse and vary by taxonomy. with grass xylan representing a unique composition distinct from dicots and other monocots. To date. no enzyme has yet been identified that is specific to grass xylan synthesis. We identified a xylose-deficient loss-of-function rice mutant in Os02g22380. a putative glycosyltransferase in a grass-specific subfamily of family GT61.

The pectic polysaccharides have a complex structure but can generally be divided into homogalacturonan. rhamnogalacturonan I. rhamnogalacturonan II (RGII) and xylogalacturonan (XGA). These polysaccharides appear to be present in all cells but their relative abundance and structural details differ between cell types and species. Pectin is synthesized in the Golgi vesicles and its complexity dictates that a large number of enzymes must be involved in the process. The biosynthetic enzymes required are glycosyltransferases and decorating enzymes including methyltransferases. acetyltransferases and feruloyltransferases.

Particularly. the diabetic kidney disease (nephropathy. DN) together with its cardiovascular complications cause immense human suffering. highly increased risk of premature deaths and lead to huge societal costs. DN is first detected when protein appears in urine (microalbuminuria). As in other persisting proteinuric diseases (like vasculitis) it heralds irreversible damage of kidney functions up to non-functional (end-stage) kidney and ultimately calls for kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation). While remarkable progress has been made in understanding the genetic and molecular factors associating with chronic kidney diseases. breakthroughs are still missing to provide comprehensive understanding of events and mechanisms associated. Non-invasive diagnostic tools for early diagnostics of kidney damage are badly needed. Exosomes - small vesicular structures present in urine are released by all cell types along kidney structures to present with distinct surface assembly. Furthermore. exosomes carry a load of special proteins and nucleic acids. This ""cargo"" faithfully reflects the physiological state of their respective cells of origin and appears to serve as a new pathway for downstream signalling to target cells.

Rather than exerting direct antioxidant effects. the mechanisms by which polyphenols express these beneficial properties appear to involve their interaction with cellular signaling pathways and related machinery that mediate cell function under both normal and pathological conditions. We illustrate that their interactions with two such pathways. the MAP kinase (ERK. JNK. p38) and PI3 kinase/Akt signaling cascades. allow them to impact upon normal and abnormal cell function. thus influencing the cellular processes involved in the initiation and progression of cancer. CVD and neurodegeneration. For example. their ability to activate ERK in neurons leads to a promotion of neuronal survival and cognitive enhancements. both of which influence the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. whilst ERK activation by polyphenols in vascular endothelial cells influences nitric oxide production. blood pressure and ultimately CVD risk.

One of the RNAIII effects is the repression of spa gene (coding for the surface protein A) expression. Here. we show that spa repression occurs not only at the transcriptional level but also by RNAIII‐mediated inhibition of translation and degradation of the stable spa mRNA by the double‐strand‐specific endoribonuclease III (RNase III). The 3′ end domain of RNAIII. partially complementary to the 5′ part of spa mRNA. efficiently anneals to spa mRNA through an initial loop–loop interaction.

Although WAPL limits cohesin’s chromatin residence time to minutes. it has been reported that some loops exist for hours. How these loops can persist is unknown. We show that during G1-phase. mammalian cells contain acetylated cohesinSTAG1 which binds chromatin for hours. whereas cohesinSTAG2 binds chromatin for minutes. Our results indicate that CTCF and the acetyltransferase ESCO1 protect a subset of cohesinSTAG1 complexes from WAPL. thereby enable formation of long and presumably long-lived loops. and that ESCO1. like CTCF. contributes to boundary formation in chromatin looping.

Production of second generation bioethanol is hindered by economics. particularly in the cost of pretreatment (including waste management and solvent recovery). the cost of saccharification enzymes (particularly exocellulases and endocellulases displaying kcat ~1 s−1 on crystalline cellulose). and the inefficiency of co-fermentation of 5- and 6-carbon monosaccharides (owing in part to redox cofactor imbalances in Saccharomyces cerevisiae).,True,X1Vf8qYAAAAJ:jSAVyFp_754C,238,https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-abstract/442/2/241/45958,6450351950345017060,/scholar?cites=6450351950345017060,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/55136/PDF,0,0,0

The enzyme is structurally similar to the mechanistically related histidine ammonia lyase (HAL). with PAL having an additional ∼160 residues extending from the common fold. We propose that catalysis (including lowering the pKa of nonacidic C3 of l-phenylalanine for an E1cb mechanism) is potentially governed by dipole moments of seven α helices associated with the PAL active site (six positive poles and one negative pole). Cofactor 3.5-dihydro-5-methylidene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO) resides atop the positive poles of three helices. for increasing its electrophilicity.

Although endothelin has been studied extensively. little is known about its metabolism in vivo. Neutral endopeptidase EC.3.4.24.11 is reported to degrade endothelin in vitro. Therefore. we studied the effect of neutral endopeptidase inhibition by SQ29.072 on plasma levels and urinary excretion of endogenous and exogenous endothelin.

We recently have shown a high incidence of unexplained pulmonary hypertension (PHT) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on chronic haemodialysis (HD) therapy via arterio-venous (A-V) access. This study evaluated the possibility that PHT in these patients is triggered or aggravated by chronic HD via surgical A-V access. and the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric oxide (NO) in this syndrome. Methods. Forty-two HD patients underwent clinical evaluation. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was evaluated using Doppler echocardiography. Levels of ET-1 and NO metabolites in plasma were determined before and after the HD procedure and were compared between subgroups of patients with and without PHT. Results.

The immediate cause of morbidity is leakiness of the sarcolemmal membrane to cardiotoxic or nephrotoxic cations and metabolites (K. PO4. myoglobin and urate) of the sarcoplasma. and rapid massive uptake by the muscles of extracellular fluid. sodium and calcium. leading to profound hypovolemic and hyocalcemic shock. Casualties who survive the early steep of hyperkalemia and arterial hypotension are susceptible to myoglubinuric acute renal failure owing mainly to the combination of renal vasoconstriction. nephrotoxicity. and tubular obstruction by myoglobin plugs and urate. Management includes immediate (prehospital) intravenous volume replacement followed by mannitol-alkaline diuresis. The alkali regimen ameliorates the acidosis associated with shock and the hyperkalemia. and protects against the nephrotoxicity of myoglobin and urate by alkalinization of the urine. Mannitol. through its impermeant hyperoncotic properties. decompresses and mobilizes muscle edema and promotes renal tubular flow. thus flushing myoglobin plugs and enhancing urinary elimination of nephrotoxic metabolites.

Under normal conditions. ANP is synthesized by the atrium and released in response to atrial stretch.

The process of amyloidogenesis is associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer. Parkinson. and Huntington disease. We report the discovery of an unprecedented functional mammalian amyloid structure generated by the protein Pmel17. This discovery demonstrates that amyloid is a fundamental nonpathological protein fold utilized by organisms from bacteria to humans. We have found that Pmel17 amyloid templates and accelerates the covalent polymerization of reactive small molecules into melanin—a critically important biopolymer that protects against a broad range of cytotoxic insults including UV and oxidative damage. Pmel17 amyloid also appears to play a role in mitigating the toxicity associated with melanin formation by sequestering and minimizing diffusion of highly reactive. toxic melanin precursors out of the melanosome. Intracellular Pmel17 amyloidogenesis is carefully orchestrated by the secretory pathway. utilizing membrane sequestration and proteolytic steps to protect the cell from amyloid and amyloidogenic intermediates that can be toxic. While functional and pathological amyloid share similar structural features. critical differences in packaging and kinetics of assembly enable the usage of Pmel17 amyloid for normal function. The discovery of native Pmel17 amyloid in mammals provides key insight into the molecular basis of both melanin formation and amyloid pathology. and demonstrates that native amyloid (amyloidin) may be an ancient. evolutionarily conserved protein quaternary structure underpinning diverse …,True,Q6aUuPwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,793,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040006,8885369072865026910,/scholar?cites=8885369072865026910,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040006,0,0,0

Traditional approaches to study these properties have typically required the direct measurement of the property of interest. oftentimes a laborious undertaking.

Recent technological developments have enabled the rapid quantification of a protein’s function. such as binding to a ligand. for numerous variants of that protein.

Because the overwhelming majority of variants are present in only a few living humans. this strategy has clear limits. Fully realizing the clinical potential of genetics requires that we accurately infer pathogenicity even for rare or private variation. Many computational approaches to predicting variant effects have been developed. but they can identify only a small fraction of pathogenic variants with the high confidence that is required in the clinic. Experimentally measuring a variant’s functional consequences can provide clearer guidance. but individual assays performed only after the discovery of the variant are both time and resource intensive.

The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway functions to stabilize β-catenin. and the noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway activates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). In addition. the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway activated by Wnt-5a antagonizes the Wnt/β-catenin pathway via an unknown mechanism.

124207,MiR-107 and MiR-185 can induce cell cycle arrest in human non small cell lung cancer cell lines,2009,Yukari Takahashi and Alistair RR Forrest and Emi Maeno and Takehiro Hashimoto and Carsten O Daub and Jun Yasuda,4,PloS one,8,e6677,Public Library of Science,Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short single stranded noncoding RNAs that suppress gene expression through either translational repression or degradation of target mRNAs. The annealing between messenger RNAs and 5′ seed region of miRNAs is believed to be essential for the specific suppression of target gene expression. One miRNA can have several hundred different targets in a cell. Rapidly accumulating evidence suggests that many miRNAs are involved in cell cycle regulation and consequentially play critical roles in carcinogenesis.  Methodology/Principal Findings Introduction of synthetic miR-107 or miR-185 suppressed growth of the human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis revealed these miRNAs induce a G1 cell cycle arrest in H1299 cells and the suppression of cell cycle progression is stronger than that by Let-7 miRNA. By the gene expression analyses with oligonucleotide microarrays. we find hundreds of genes are affected by transfection of these miRNAs. Using miRNA-target prediction analyses and the array data. we listed up a set of likely targets of miR-107 and miR-185 for G1 cell cycle arrest and validate a subset of them using real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting for CDK6.  Conclusions/Significance We identified new cell cycle regulating miRNAs. miR-107 and miR-185. localized in frequently altered chromosomal regions in human lung cancers. Especially for miR-107. a large number of down-regulated genes are annotated with the gene ontology term ‘cell cycle’.

The enzyme subunit is made up of 595 amino acid residues folded into a single α+β domain. There are 12 bromoperoxidase subunits. arranged with 23-point group symmetry. A cavity is formed by the N terminus of each subunit in the centre of the dodecamer. The subunit fold and dimer organisation of the Cor. officinalis vanadium bromoperoxidase are similar to those of the dimeric enzyme from the brown algae Ascophyllum nodosum. with which it shares 33 % sequence identity.

124231,Transport and action of ascorbate at the plant plasma membrane,2000,Nele Horemans and Christine H Foyer and Han Asard,5,,6,263-267,Elsevier Current Trends,The plasmalemma is both a bridge and a barrier between the cytoplasm and the outside world. It is a dynamic interface that perceives and transmits information concerning changes in the environment to the nucleus to modify gene expression. In plants. ascorbate is an essential part of this dialogue. The concentration and ratio of reduced to oxidized ascorbate in the apoplast. for example. possibly modulates cell division and growth.

At a physiological level. the best-studied phenomena involving ascorbate is its participation in an oxygen scavenging pathway in the chloroplast known as the ascorbate-glutathione cycle. In addition. evidence is emerging that ascorbate fulfils essential roles in growth. development and defence outside the chloroplast. Despite its importance in plant biology. the pathway of ascorbate biosynthesis has only recently been elucidated. From the site of synthesis in the mitochondria. ascorbate must be transported to other cellular compartments where it accumulates to high concentrations.

Maize is an economically important cereal crop affected by high salinity. In this study. maize seedlings were subjected to two 75 mM and 150 mM NaCl. to emulate high soil salinity. Roots. mature leaves (basal leaf-pair 1.2) and young leaves (distal leaf-pair 3.4) were harvested after 3 weeks of sowing. Roots showed the highest reduction in biomass. followed by mature and young leaves in the salt-stressed plants. Concomitant with the pattern of growth reduction. roots accumulated the highest levels of Na+ followed by mature and young leaves. High salinity induced oxidative stress in the roots and mature leaves. but to a lesser extent in younger leaves. The younger leaves showed increased electrolyte leakage (EL). malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations only at 150 mM NaCl. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and polyphenol content increased with the increase in salinity levels in roots and mature leaves. but showed no changes in the young leaves. Under salinity stress. reduced ascorbate (ASC) and glutathione (GSH) content increased in roots. while total tocopherol levels increased specifically in the shoot tissues. Similarly. redox changes estimated by the ratio of redox couples (ASC/total ascorbate and GSH/total glutathione) showed significant decreases in the roots.

Thus integrins modulate the efficiency of the Erk (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase)/MAP kinase (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway. acting at several distinct levels. We have shown that both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and PAKs (p21-activated kinases) play a role in integrin regulation of the Erk pathway. acting primarily at the level of Raf-1. Integrins and PAKs also play a role in the control of cell migration. Thus we have discovered a novel protein that links the α5β1 integrin to migration controlled by Rho-family GTPases. This protein. termed Nischarin. is a large cytosolic macromolecule that is not related to well-known protein families.

In response to hyperproliferative signals. p14Arf stabilizes p53 by binding to Hdm2 and inhibits the ubiquitination and subsequent proteosome-dependent degradation of p53. The medical importance of the Arf-Hdm2-p53 regulatory system is highlighted by the finding that either p53 or p14Arf are lost or modified in virtually all human cancers. Isolated Arf and Hdm2 domains are dynamically disordered in solution. yet they retain the ability to interact in vitro and in cellular assays. Upon binding. domains of both Arf and Hdm2 undergo a dramatic transition from disordered conformations to extended structures comprised of β-strands. The presence of domains from both proteins are necessary and sufficient for the formation of the highly stable extended β structures.

The Rhodobacter sphaeroides genes. bchl and bchD together. and bchH alone. were cloned and expressed with the pET3a vector in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). The 40‐kDa BchI protein was synthesized in greater abundance compared to the 70‐kDa BchD protein when both were expressed together from the same plasmid. The production of large amounts of the 140‐kDa BchH protein in E. coli was accompanied by an accumulation of protoporphyrin IX. The accumulated protoporphyrin IX was bound specifically to BchH in an approximate molar ratio of 1:1. All three recombinant proteins were soluble; BchH was monomeric. BchI was dimeric. while BchD appeared to be polymeric with a molecular mass of approximately 550 kDa.

This expands the range of light that can be used to drive photosynthesis. Quantitative determination of chlorophylls is a crucial step in the investigation of chlorophyll-photosynthetic reactions in the field of photobiology and photochemistry. No methods have yet been worked out for the quantitative determination of chlorophyll f. There is also no method available for the precise quantitative determination of chlorophyll d although it was discovered in 1943. In order to obtain the extinction coefficients (ε) of chlorophyll f and chlorophyll d. the concentrations of chlorophylls were determined by Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry according to the fact that each chlorophyll molecule contains one magnesium (Mg) atom.

124313,An insight into the “-omics” based engineering of streptomycetes for secondary metabolite overproduction,2013,Amit Kumar Chaudhary and Dipesh Dhakal and Jae Kyung Sohng,2013,,,,Hindawi,Microorganisms produce a range of chemical substances representing a vast diversity of fascinating molecular architectures not available in any other system. Among them. Streptomyces are frequently used to produce useful enzymes and a wide variety of secondary metabolites with potential biological activities. Streptomyces are preferred over other microorganisms for producing more than half of the clinically useful naturally originating pharmaceuticals. However. these compounds are usually produced in very low amounts (or not at all) under typical laboratory conditions. Despite the superiority of Streptomyces. they still lack well documented genetic information and a large number of in-depth molecular biological tools for strain improvement. Previous attempts to produce high yielding strains required selection of the genetic material through classical mutagenesis for commercial production of secondary metabolites. optimizing culture conditions. and random selection. However. a profound effect on the strategy for strain development has occurred with the recent advancement of whole-genome sequencing. systems biology. and genetic engineering. In this review. we demonstrate a few of the major issues related to the potential of “-omics” technology (genomics. transcriptomics. proteomics. and metabolomics) for improving streptomycetes as an intelligent chemical factory for enhancing the production of useful bioactive compounds.,True,RZ4rFWUAAAAJ:EsEWqaRxkBgC,80,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2013/968518/abs/,17643128420283028136,/scholar?cites=17643128420283028136,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2013/968518/abs/,0,0,0

Phosphorylation of PPPSP motifs in the LRP6 cytoplasmic domain is crucial for signal transduction.

One view of its function is that it acts as an auxiliary gland to support the endocrine role of the pars distalis (PD) (2). as it has been shown to contain immunocytochemically identifiable thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs (1). Many of the cells of the PT are. however. ultrastructurally unique suggesting an independent function for this tissue. Our recent demonstration that the PT of the rat is a major binding site for the ligand iodomelatonin lends further support to this idea (3). We have utilized the highly specific ligand [125l]melatonin. and have demonstrated that it binds exclusively. with very high affinity. to the PT but not the PD of the adult sheep adenohypophysis. These findings support the conclusion that the PT has a distinct role in relation to melatonin action and seasonal reproduction.,True,T9eU4K0AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,205,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2826.1989.tb00068.x,13860768365745302969,/scholar?cites=13860768365745302969,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2826.1989.tb00068.x,0,0,0

One of its best-known and cancer-relevant functions is to stimulate cell proliferation. Recent work has implicated Wnt components in regulating mitotic events. suggesting that the cell cycle and Wnt signaling are directly linked. This concept has now been substantially strengthened with the finding that the mitotic CDK14/cyclin Y complex promotes Wnt signaling through phosphorylation of the LRP6 co-receptor. a key regulatory nexus in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Thus. an unexpectedly tight collaboration between the mitotic cell cycle machinery and Wnt signaling is emerging. suggesting that this pathway might orchestrate mitotic processes.,True,T9eU4K0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,142,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962892410000851,7619380713036701813,/scholar?cites=7619380713036701813,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.626.2199&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Specific binding of radioligand was found in regions of the epithalamus and hypothalamus in the brain and the pars tuberalis of the pituitary. Excitatory amino‐acid lesions destroyed [125|]iodomelatonin binding within the brain. demonstrating that binding sites are located on neurons. Analysis of [125|]iodomelatonin binding to membrane homogenates of the pars tuberalis revealed a linear relationship between specific ligand binding and the amount of tissue.

Dose-dependent inhibition of 2-[125I]-melatonin binding was observed. with an order of potency of GTPγS > Gpp(NH)p > GTP = GDP. GMP. cyclic GMP and ATP had negligible effects. Analysis of saturable binding revealed that GTPγS (1 µM) promoted an apparent reduction in receptor density of about 50%. without a concomitant change in receptor affinity. These results are consistent with a melatonin receptor existing in an equilibrium between high- and low-affinity states. with GTP and related analogues able to cause a shift in the equilibrium in favour of the lower-affinity form.

Here we describe a novel functional interaction between Akt and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase. Akt decreased ASK1 kinase activity stimulated by both oxidative stress and overexpression in 293 cells by phosphorylating a consensus Akt site at serine 83 of ASK1. Activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway also inhibited the serum deprivation-induced activity of endogenous ASK1 in L929 cells. An association between Akt and ASK1 was detected in cells by coimmunoprecipitation.

Here we describe a novel interaction between Akt1 and JNK interacting protein 1 (JIP1). a JNK pathway scaffold. Direct association between Akt1 and JIP1 was observed in primary neurons. Neuronal exposure to an excitotoxic stimulus decreased the Akt1-JIP1 interaction and concomitantly increased association between JIP1 and JNK. Akt1 interaction with JIP1 inhibited JIP1-mediated potentiation of JNK activity by decreasing JIP1 binding to specific JNK pathway kinases. Consistent with this view. neurons from Akt1-deficient mice exhibited higher susceptibility to kainate than wild-type littermates. Overexpression of Akt1 mutants that bind JIP1 reduced excitotoxic apoptosis.

Knockdown of Cdc20 in cerebellar slices and in postnatal rats in vivo profoundly impairs the formation of granule neuron dendrite arbors in the cerebellar cortex. Remarkably. Cdc20 is enriched at the centrosome in neurons. and the centrosomal localization is critical for Cdc20-dependent dendrite development.

To combat invading bacteria. animals go into an iron-withholding mode and also use a protein (Nramp1) to generate reactive oxygen species in an attempt to kill the pathogens. Some invading bacteria respond by producing specific iron chelators—siderophores—that remove the iron from the host sources. Other bacteria rely on direct contact with host iron proteins. either abstracting the iron at their surface or. as with heme. taking it up into the cytoplasm.

Although the function of a number of genes involved in fatty acid and mycolic acid biosynthesis is known. information relevant to the initial steps within these biosynthetic pathways is relatively sparse. Interestingly. the genomes of Corynebacterianeae possess a high number of accD genes. whose gene products resemble the β-subunit of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase of Escherichia coli. providing the activated intermediate for fatty acid synthesis.

Therefore. understanding the mechanisms of activation of current antimycobacterials not only helps to decipher mechanisms of drug resistance but may also facilitate the development of alternative activation strategies or of analogues that do not require such processes. Herein. through the use of genetically defined strains of Mycobacterium bovis BCG we provide evidence that EthA. previously shown to activate ethionamide. also converts isoxyl (ISO) and thiacetazone (TAC) into reactive species.

Of major importance to the pathogenicity and resilience of the latter is its particularly complex cell envelope. The corynebacteria share many of the features of this extraordinary structure although to a lesser level of complexity. The cell envelope of M. tuberculosis has provided the molecular targets for several of the major anti-tubercular drugs. Given a backdrop of emerging multi-drug resistant strains of the organism (MDR-TB) and its continuing global threat to human health. the search for novel anti-tubercular agents is of paramount importance.

High energy quenching (qE) is the increased thermal dissipation of light energy triggered by lumen acidification. To investigate the respective roles of qE and qT in photoprotection. a mutant (npq4 stt7-9) was generated in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by crossing the state transition–deficient mutant (stt7-9) with a strain having a largely reduced qE capacity (npq4).

Some congeners. particularly those with lateral chlorine substitutions at positions 2. 3. 7 and 8. are extremely toxic and carcinogenic to humans 1. One particularly promising mechanism for the detoxification of PCDDs and PCDFs is microbial reductive dechlorination.

Ltd.,Activation of transcription factors plays a pivotal role in many signal transduction pathways. Of particular interest is NF‐κB. which is present in the cytoplasm in an inactive form. where it can be activated in response to many different stress conditions such as infection. inflammation. heat shock etc. It has also been associated with apoptosis and tissue repair. Modulation of signal transduction events that mediate activation of NF‐κB seems to have a great potential in not only treating many disease conditions. but also in tissue repair. The present review article is an attempt to put together many different conditions where the NF‐κB activation pathway appears to be crucial in transducing signals under stress conditions. and to explore the possibility of its modulation as a targeted treatment modality.

METHODS: A total of 25.505 pregnant women at 15 centers in nine countries underwent 75-g oral glucose-tolerance testing at 24 to 32 weeks of gestation. Data remained blinded if the fasting plasma glucose level was 105 mg per deciliter (5.8 mmol per liter) or less and the 2-hour plasma glucose level was 200 mg per deciliter (11.1 mmol per liter) or less. Primary outcomes were birth weight above the 90th percentile for gestational age. primary cesarean delivery. clinically diagnosed neonatal hypoglycemia. and cord-blood serum C-peptide level above the 90th percentile. Secondary outcomes were delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. shoulder dystocia or birth injury. need for intensive neonatal care. hyperbilirubinemia. and preeclampsia. RESULTS: For the 23.316 participants with blinded data. we calculated adjusted odds ratios for adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with an increase in the fasting plasma glucose level of 1 SD (6.9 mg per deciliter [0.4 mmol per liter]). an increase in the 1-hour plasma glucose level of 1 SD (30.9 mg per deciliter [1.7 mmol per liter]). and an increase in the 2-hour plasma glucose level of 1 SD (23.5 mg per deciliter [1.3 mmol per liter]).

It is due to dysfunction of pancreatic ß cells characterised by non-ketotic diabetes and absence of pancreatic auto-antibodies. It is frequently mistaken for type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diagnosis of MODY is important as the GCK subtype has better prognosis and may not require any treatment. Subtypes HNF1A and HNF4A are sensitive to sulfonylureas. however diabetes complications are common if not treated early. Moreover. there is genetic implication for the patient and family.

The L-chain. in contrast to the H-chain. lacks detectable ferroxidase activity. and its role in ferritin iron incorporation is unclear. In this study. apoferritins were subjected to iron loading with large iron increments to favour spontaneous iron hydrolysis. The homopolymers of the wild-type H-chain. and of a mutant H-chain with an inactivated ferroxidase centre. formed massive protein aggregates. while the L-chain homopolymers remained mostly soluble.

DNA hybridization and molecular interaction studies are major tools for the diagnosis of genetic disease. in which the clinical symptoms are linked to alterations in DNA. Identifying these mutations in human genome has become the focus of many research efforts. One recent new development is a novel class of oligonucleotide probes. molecular beacons (MBs). Molecular beacons. first developed by Tyagi and Kramer in 1996. 1 are single stranded oligonucleotide probes that possess a stem-and-loop structure.

A fluorophore and a quencher are linked to the two ends of the stem. as shown in Figure 1. The stem keeps these two moieties in close proximity to each other. causing the fluorescence of the fluorophore to be quenched by energy transfer. When the probe encounters a target DNA molecule. it forms a hybrid that is longer and more stable than the stem. and its rigidity and length preclude the simultaneous existence of the stem hybrid. Thus. the MB undergoes a spontaneous conformational reorganization that forces the stem apart and causes the fluorophore and the quencher to move away from each other. leading to the restoration of fluorescence. Therefore. at room temperature. the MBs emit an intense fluorescent signal only when hybridized to their target molecules. 1-8 The size of the loop and its content can be varied by designing …,True,zhs-g4EAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC,347,https://bioee.ee.columbia.edu/courses/upload/Bibliography/fang_jacs_1999.pdf,17559153947846505370,/scholar?cites=17559153947846505370,,https://bioee.ee.columbia.edu/courses/upload/Bibliography/fang_jacs_1999.pdf,0,0,0

Herein. we have evaluated the effects of a number of copper complexes that are typically used to catalyze CuAAC reactions on four human cell lines by measuring mitochondrial activity based on the metabolism of 3-(4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to study toxicity. inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to study cellular uptake. and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS …,True,Nf-Q9iIAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,315,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja2083027,18057348322967978849,/scholar?cites=18057348322967978849,,,0,0,0

124530,The role of skeletal muscle glycogen breakdown for regulation of insulin sensitivity by exercise,2011,Jørgen Jensen and Per Inge Rustad and Anders Jensen Kolnes and Yu-Chiang Lai,2,,,112,Frontiers,Glycogen is the storage form of carbohydrates in mammals. In humans the majority of glycogen is stored in skeletal muscles (~500 g) and the liver (~100 g). Food is supplied in larger meals. but the blood glucose concentration has to be kept within narrow limits to survive and stay healthy. Therefore. the body has to cope with periods of excess carbohydrates and periods without supplementation. Healthy persons remove blood glucose rapidly when glucose is in excess. but insulin-stimulated glucose disposal is reduced in insulin resistant and type 2 diabetic subjects. During a hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic clamp. 70-90 % of glucose disposal will be stored as muscle glycogen in healthy subjects. The glycogen stores in skeletal muscles are limited because an efficient feedback-mediated inhibition of glycogen synthase prevents accumulation. De novo lipid synthesis can contribute to glucose disposal when glycogen stores are filled. Exercise physiologists normally consider glycogen’s main function as energy substrate. Glycogen is the main energy substrate during exercise intensity above 70 % of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and fatigue develops when the glycogen stores are depleted in the active muscles. After exercise. the rate of glycogen synthesis is increased to replete glycogen stores. and blood glucose is the substrate. Indeed insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis is elevated after exercise. which. from an evolutional point of view. will favour glycogen repletion and preparation for new “fight or flight” events. In the modern society. the reduced glycogen stores in skeletal muscles after exercise allows carbohydrates …,True,pnfOG3sAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,280,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2011.00112/full,18330452295724476137,/scholar?cites=18330452295724476137,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2011.00112/full,0,0,0

Although recent profiling studies have identified numerous myokines. the amount of overlap from these studies indicates that the secretome of skeletal muscle is still incompletely characterized. One limitation of the models used is the lack of contraction. a central characteristic of muscle cells. Here we aimed to characterize the secretome of primary human myotubes by cytokine antibody arrays and to identify myokines regulated by contraction. which was induced by electrical pulse stimulation (EPS). In this study. we validated the regulation and release of two selected myokines. namely pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). which were recently described as adipokines. This study reveals that both factors. DPP4 and PEDF. are secreted by primary human myotubes. PEDF is a contraction-regulated myokine. although PEDF serum levels from healthy young men decrease after 60 min cycling at VO2max of 70%. Most interestingly. we identified 52 novel myokines which have not been described before to be secreted by skeletal muscle cells. For 48 myokines we show that their release is regulated by contractile activity.

Glycogen synthase activity is regulated by phosphorylation and allosterically activated by glucose 6-phosphate. Phosphorylation of nine serines by different kinases regulates glycogen synthase affinity for glucose 6-phosphate and its substrate UDP-glucose. Glucose 6-phosphate increases both enzyme activity and substrate affinity. Insulin and exercise increase glycogen synthase affinity for glucose 6-phosphate and activity whereas high glycogen content and adrenaline decrease affinity for glucose 6-phosphate and activity.

Ltd,MutS. MutL and MutH are the three essential proteins for initiation of methyl‐directed DNA mismatch repair to correct mistakes made during DNA replication in Escherichia coli. MutH cleaves a newly synthesized and unmethylated daughter strand 5′ to the sequence d (GATC) in a hemi‐methylated duplex. Activation of MutH requires the recognition of a DNA mismatch by MutS and MutL. We have crystallized MutH in two space groups and solved the structures at 1.7 and 2.3 Å resolution. respectively.

The results obtained for prokaryotic MMR proteins have provided a framework for the study of the MMR system in eukaryotic organisms. such as yeast. mouse and human. because the functions of MMR proteins have been conserved during evolution from bacteria to humans. However. mutations in eukaryotic MMR genes result in pleiotropic phenotypes in addition to MMR defects. suggesting that eukaryotic MMR proteins have evolved to gain more diverse and specific roles in multicellular organisms.

Organized cellular DNA (chromatin) presents substantial barriers to such lengthy searches. Using dynamic single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer. we determined that the mismatch repair (MMR) initiation protein MutS forms a transient clamp that scans duplex DNA for mismatched nucleotides by 1D diffusion for 1 s (~ 700 base pairs) while in continuous rotational contact with the DNA. Mismatch identification provokes ATP binding (3 s) that induces distinctly different MutS sliding clamps with unusual stability on DNA (~ 600 s). which may be released by adjacent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).

However. very little is known about the nature of molecular determinants secreted by these Gram‐positive bacteria that are responsible for the elicitation of the induced systemic resistance (ISR) phenomenon. This study shows that the lipopeptides surfactins and fengycins may be involved in this elicitation process. In bean. pure fengycins and surfactins provided a significant ISR‐mediated protective effect on bean plants. similar to the one induced by living cells of the producing strain S499. Moreover. experiments conducted on bean and tomato plants showed that overexpression of both surfactin and fengycin biosynthetic genes in the naturally poor producer Bacillus subtilis strain 168 was associated with a significant increase in the potential of the derivatives to induce resistance.

To face these drawbacks. producers have become increasingly dependent on agrochemicals. However. intensive use of these compounds has led to the emergence of pathogen resistance and severe negative environmental impacts. There are also a number of plant diseases for which chemical solutions are ineffective or non-existent as well as an increasing demand by consumers for pesticide-free food. Thus. biological control through the use of natural antagonistic microorganisms has emerged as a promising alternative to chemical pesticides for more rational and safe crop management. The genome of the plant-associated B. amyloliquefaciens GA1 was sample sequenced. Several gene clusters involved in the synthesis of biocontrol agents were detected. Four gene clusters were shown to direct the synthesis of the cyclic lipopeptides surfactin. iturin A and fengycin as well as the iron-siderophore bacillibactin. Beside these non-ribosomaly synthetised peptides. three additional gene clusters directing the synthesis of the antibacterial polyketides macrolactin. bacillaene and difficidin were identified. Mass spectrometry analysis of culture supernatants led to the identification of these secondary metabolites. hence demonstrating that the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters are functional in strain GA1. In addition. genes encoding enzymes involved in synthesis and export of the dipeptide antibiotic bacilysin were highlighted.

The C-terminal domain of this multimodular protein is an extracellular domain which specifically recognizes β-lactam antibiotics. When it binds a β-lactam. a signal is transmitted by the transmembrane region to the intracellular loops. In response. the hydrolytic activity of the BlaR large cytoplasmic L3 loop is induced. and a cascade of reactions is generated. leading to the transcription of the β-lactamase gene. Here. we describe the crystal structure of the extracellular penicillin-receptor domain of BlaR (residues 346−601) at 2.5 Å resolution in order to understand why this domain. whose folding is very similar to that of class D β-lactamases. behaves as a highly sensitive penicillin-binding protein rather than a β-lactamase.

Evidence is presented that the interaction between the indole group of Trp154 and the carboxylated lysine is essential for the stability of the posttranslationally modified Lys70. Substitution of Trp154 by Gly. Ala. or Phe yielded noncarboxylated enzymes which displayed poor catalytic efficiencies and reduced stability when compared to the wild-type OXA-10.

In intact bacteria. this nucleotide is synthesized only in the absence of a metabolizable carbon source and quickly disappears as soon as the cells receive a carbon source such as glucose. Thus. we hypothesized that AThTP may be a signal produced in response to carbon starvation. Here we show that. in bacterial extracts. the biosynthesis of AThTP is carried out from thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) and ADP or ATP by a soluble high molecular mass nucleotidyl transferase. We partially purified this enzyme and characterized some of its functional properties. The enzyme activity had an absolute requirement for divalent metal ions. such as Mn2+ or Mg2+. as well as for a heat-stable soluble activator present in bacterial extracts. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 6.5–7.0 and a high Km for ThDP (5 mM). suggesting that. in vivo. the rate of AThTP synthesis is proportional to the free ThDP concentration. When ADP was used as the variable substrate at a fixed ThDP concentration. a sigmoid curve was obtained. with a Hill coefficient of 2.1 and an S0.5 value of 0.08 mM. The specificity of the AThTP synthesizing enzyme with respect to nucleotide substrate is restricted to ATP/ADP. and only ThDP can serve as the second substrate of the reaction. We tentatively named this enzyme ThDP adenylyl transferase (EC 2.7.7.65). This is the first demonstration of an enzyme activity transferring a nucleotidyl group on thiamine diphosphate to produce AThTP.

Wortmannin. which is known as a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and normally inhibits growth factor-induced activation of RAC-PK. did not suppress heat-shock induced activation of RAC-PK. indicating that this stress-induced activation of the kinase is not mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The PH domain was indispensable for stress-induced activation of RAC PK. In heat-treated cells. PKC delta. a member of the protein kinase C family. was found to associate with the PH domain of RAC-PK. This PKC subspecies was phosphorylated in vitro by RAC-PK.

Efforts have been made to reduce fruit softening in transgenic tomato through the suppression of genes encoding cell wall–degrading proteins. However. these have met with very limited success. N-glycans are reported to play an important role during fruit ripening. although the role of any particular enzyme is yet unknown. We have identified and targeted two ripening-specific N-glycoprotein modifying enzymes. α-mannosidase (α-Man) and β-D-N-acetylhexosaminidase (β-Hex). We show that their suppression enhances fruit shelf life. owing to the reduced rate of softening. Analysis of transgenic tomatoes revealed ≈2.5- and ≈2-fold firmer fruits in the α-Man and β-Hex RNAi lines. respectively. and ≈30 days of enhanced shelf life.

124613,Small RNAs in plants: recent development and application for crop improvement,2015,Ayushi Kamthan and Abira Chaudhuri and Mohan Kamthan and Asis Datta,6,Frontiers in plant science,,,Frontiers Media SA,The phenomenon of RNA interference (RNAi) which involves sequence specific gene regulation by small non-coding RNAs i.e small interfering RNA (siRNA) and micro RNA (miRNA) has emerged as one of most powerful approaches for crop improvement. RNAi based on siRNA is one of the widely used tools of reverse genetics which aid in revealing gene functions in many species. This technology has been extensively applied to alter the gene expression in plants with an aim to achieve desirable traits. RNAi has been used for enhancing the crop yield and productivity by manipulating the gene involved in biomass. grain yield and enhanced shelf life of fruits & vegetables. It has also been applied for developing resistance against various biotic (bacteria. fungi. viruses. nematodes. insects) and abiotic stresses (drought. salinity. cold etc.). Nutritional improvements of crops have also been achieved by enriching the crops with essential amino acids. fatty acids. antioxidants and other nutrients beneficial for human health or by reducing allergens or anti-nutrients. Micro RNAs are key regulators of important plant processes like growth. development and response to various stresses. In spite of similarity in size (20-24nt). miRNA differ from siRNA in precursor structures. pathway of biogenesis. and modes of action. This review also highlights the miRNA based genetic modification technology where various miRNAs/artificial miRNAs and their targets can be utilized for improving several desirable plant traits.

Although microbial metal reduction has been identified as an effective means for immobilizing highly-soluble uranium(VI) complexes in situ. the biomolecular mechanisms of U(VI) reduction are not well understood. Here. we show that c-type cytochromes of a dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium. Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. are essential for the reduction of U(VI) and formation of extracelluar UO2 nanoparticles. In particular. the outer membrane (OM) decaheme cytochrome MtrC (metal reduction). previously implicated in Mn(IV) and Fe(III) reduction. directly transferred electrons to U(VI). Additionally. deletions of mtrC and/or omcA significantly affected the in vivo U(VI) reduction rate relative to wild-type MR-1. Similar to the wild-type. the mutants accumulated UO2 nanoparticles extracellularly to high densities in association with an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). In wild-type cells. this UO2-EPS matrix exhibited glycocalyx-like properties and contained multiple elements of the OM. polysaccharide. and heme-containing proteins. Using a novel combination of methods including synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy and high-resolution immune-electron microscopy. we demonstrate a close association of the extracellular UO2 nanoparticles with MtrC and OmcA (outer membrane cytochrome).

Extraction methods suitable for isolating both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds were used and measurements of total anthocyanin and total carotenoid were made. Two methods of measurement of oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) adapted to hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds were applied. Total anthocyanin values varied between 9.5 and 38 mg per 100 g fresh weight (FW). The hydrophilic fraction ORAC measurements among anthocyanin-rich clones varied between 250 and 1420 μmol Trolox equivalents per 100 g FW.

This pathway requires the function of a macromolecular complex called the Xcp secreton. The Xcp secreton shares many features with the machinery involved in type IV pilus assembly. More specifically. it involves the function of five pilin-like proteins. the XcpT-X pseudopilins. We show that. upon overexpression. the XcpT pseudopilin can be assembled in a pilus. which we call a type II pseudopilus. Image analysis and filtering of electron micrographs indicated that these appendages are composed of individual fibrils assembled together in a bundle structure. Our observations thus revealed that XcpT has properties similar to those of type IV pilin subunits. Interestingly. the assembly of the type II pseudopilus is not exclusively dependent on the …,True,lrupqygAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,172,https://jb.asm.org/content/185/9/2749.short,1761172353862234419,/scholar?cites=1761172353862234419,,https://jb.asm.org/content/jb/185/9/2749.full.pdf,0,0,0

Upon binding iron. the two domains in the N-terminal half of the molecule move together. Previous work has shown that this domain closure involves two hinges. Using the newly refined structure of the open form. the structural mechanism underlying this motion is analyzed here in detail.Upon closure the domains rotate 54° essentially as rigid bodies. The axis of rotation passes through the two β-strands linking the domains. These strands contain hinges in the sense that three large torsion angle changes are responsible for the bulk of the motion while smaller torsion angle changes in neighboring residues are responsible for the remainder of the motion. The rotation axes of these three torsion angle changes are nearly parallel to the axis of the overall 54° rotation. so the local motion in the hinges can be directly related to the overall motion.A crucial feature of the hinge residues …,True,AmiolBIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,186,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283683715925,667107687972431616,/scholar?cites=667107687972431616,,,0,0,0

Evidence is provided that esterases of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) catalyse not only hydrolysis of milk fat glycerides to release FFAs. but also synthesis of esters from glycerides and alcohols via a transferase reaction. The esterases of LAB prefer di- and monoglycerides for both hydrolysis and ester synthesis and are. in fact. alcohol acyltransferases that use both water (hydrolysis) and alcohol (alcoholysis) as acyl acceptors. Therefore. esterases of LAB can impact on both the lipolytic and ester flavours of cheese. The impact of esterases of LAB on cheese flavour can be controlled by manipulating the amount of the esterase. by regulating alcohol availability and/or by increasing the mono- and diglyceride composition of milk fat.

In all systems studied. the denaturation proceeded in a threshold manner. i.e. an abrupt change in catalytic and/or spectroscopic properties of dissolved proteins was observed after a certain threshold concentration of the organic solvent had been reached. To account for the observed features of the denaturation process. a thermodynamic model of the reversible protein denaturation by organic solvents was developed. based on the widely accepted notion that an undisturbed water shell around the protein globule is a prerequisite for the retention of the native state of the protein.

(b) closely related proteins with different thermostability from various mesophilic sources. and (c) mutationally altered enzymes with those from wild strains has been carried out. The main molecular mechanisms existing in nature for the creation of thermostable proteins have been elucidated. The most important mechanism is the strengthening of hydrophobic interactions in the interior of the protein globule. This mechanism has been employed to advance a novel approach to enzyme stabilization which consists of the following steps. A protein is first made to unfold into a random coil-like state and then the folding of the protein is performed in one of three ways: (1) in ‘non-native’ conditions. (2) in the presence of substances which can interact with the protein in a noncovalent fashion.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Elevated hydrostatic pressure has been used to increase catalytic activity and thermal stability of α‐chymotrypsin (CT). For an anilide substrate. characterized by a negative value of the reaction activation volume (ΔV≠). an increase in pressure at 20°C results in an exponential acceleration of the hydrolysis rate catalyzed by CT reaching a 6.5‐fold increase in activity at 4700 atm (4.7 kbar). Due to a strong temperature dependence of ΔV≠. the acceleration effect of high pressure becomes more pronounced at high temperatures. For example. at 50°C. under a pressure of 3.6 kbar. CT shows activity which is more than 30 times higher than the activity at normal conditions (20°C. 1 atm). At pressures of higher than 3.6 kbar. the enzymatic activity is decreased due to a pressure‐induced denaturation.Elevated hydrostatic pressure is also efficient for increasing stability of CT against thermal denaturation.

Fluorescence studies indicate that the inactivation results from reversible conformational changes (denaturation) of the enzymes. There is a linear correlation between the critical concentration of residual water (at which the enzyme inactivation occurs in a threshold manner) and the hydrophobicity of the organic cosolvents added.

Incorporation of differential stable isotopes in samples for relative protein quantification has been widely used. Stable isotope incorporation at the peptide level using dimethyl labeling is a reliable. cost-effective and undemanding procedure that can be easily automated and applied in high-throughput proteomics experiments. Although alternative multiplex quantitative proteomics approaches introduce isotope labels at the organism level ('stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture'(SILAC)) or enable the simultaneous analysis of eight samples (isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)). stable isotope dimethyl labeling is advantageous in that it uses inexpensive reagents and is applicable to virtually any sample.

Although found 15 years ago. the mechanism by which AREs dictate rapid mRNA decay is not clear. In yeast. 3′-to-5′ mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome. a multisubunit particle. We have purified and characterized the human exosome by mass spectrometry and found its composition to be similar to its yeast counterpart. Using a cell-free RNA decay system. we demonstrate that the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. The mammalian exosome does not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own.

In the presence of BH4. eNOS has an absorption maximum at 400 nm that shifts to 395 nm when the substrate L-arginine is added. The low-spin component of the spectrum of the BH4-free protein is decreased by the addition of BH4 without a corresponding increase in the high-spin component. Addition of BH4 decreases the low-spin population of eNOS even in the presence of excess L-arginine. These results indicate that BH4 directly modulates the heme environment. BH4-free eNOS is completely inactive. but catalytic activity is recovered when BH4 (EC50 ~200 nM) is added.

124721,Oro-sensory perception of dietary lipids: new insights into the fat taste transduction,2009,Naim Akhtar Khan and Philippe Besnard,1791,,3,149-155,Elsevier,The sense of taste informs the organism about the quality of ingested food. Five basic taste modalities. e.g.. sweet. sour. bitter. salty and umami have so far been identified. Recent compelling evidence from rodent and human studies raise the possibility for an additional sixth taste modality devoted to the perception of lipids. Recent studies strongly suggest that lingual CD36. being implicated in the perception of dietary fat. may act as a gustatory lipid sensor. Knocking down of CD36 gene decreases the spontaneous preference for long chain fatty acids (LCFA) in mice subjected to a free choice situation. Lingual CD36. after activation by LCFA. is able to trigger specific signalling mechanisms. e.g.. increase in free intracellular calcium concentrations.

These organisms. hosts of permanently cold habitats. often display metabolic fluxes more or less comparable to those exhibited by mesophilic organisms at moderate temperatures. Psychrophiles have evolved by producing. among other peculiarities. “cold-adapted” enzymes which have the properties to cope with the reduction of chemical reaction rates induced by low temperatures. Thermal compensation in these enzymes is reached. in most cases. through a high catalytic efficiency associated. however. with a low thermal stability.

124811,Recognition of nuclear targeting signals by Karyopherin-β proteins,2010,Darui Xu and Alicia Farmer and Yuh Min Chook,20,,6,782-790,Elsevier Current Trends,The Karyopherin-β family of nuclear transport factors mediates the majority of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Although each of the 19 Karyopherin-βs transports unique sets of cargos. only three classes of nuclear localization and export signals. or NLSs and NESs. have been characterized. The short basic classical-NLS was first discovered in the 1980s and their karyopherin-bound structures were first reported more than 10 years ago. More recently. structural and biophysical studies of Karyopherin-β2-cargo complexes led to definition of the complex and diverse PY-NLS. Structural knowledge of the leucine-rich NES is finally available more than 10 years after the discovery of its recognition by the exportin CRM1.

It is easily accumulated by shellfish. mainly bivalve mollusks and fish. and. subsequently. can be consumed by humans causing alimentary intoxications. OA is the main representative diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxin and its ingestion induces gastrointestinal symptoms. although it is not considered lethal. At the molecular level. OA is a specific inhibitor of several types of serine/threonine protein phosphatases and a tumor promoter in animal carcinogenesis experiments. In the last few decades. the potential toxic effects of OA. beyond its role as a DSP toxin. have been investigated in a number of studies. Alterations in DNA and cellular components. as well as effects on immune and nervous system. and even on embryonic development. have been increasingly reported. In this manuscript. results from all these studies are compiled and reviewed to clarify the role of this toxin not only as a DSP inductor but also as cause of alterations at the cellular and molecular levels. and to highlight the relevance of biomonitoring its effects on human health. Despite further investigations are required to elucidate OA mechanisms of action. toxicokinetics. and harmful effects. there are enough evidences illustrating its toxicity. not related to DSP induction. and. consequently. supporting a revision of the current regulation on OA levels in food.

The proteasome is composed of a 20 S catalytic core and additional subunits that are thought to be involved in the recognition and unfolding of ubiquitinated proteins; the composite structure has a sedimentation coefficient of 26 S. Lactacystin binds certain catalytic subunits of the 20 S proteasome and inhibits the three best characterized peptidase activities of the proteasome. two irreversibly and all at different rates (1). At least one of these catalytic subunits is modified by lactacystin on the side chain hydroxyl of the amino-terminal threonine (1). which appears to function as the catalytic nucleophile in the proteolytic mechanism. Lactacystin also inhibits peptide hydrolysis by the larger 26 S complex and inhibits ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of short and long lived proteins in the cell (2). This small molecule is currently the only compound known that inhibits the proteasome specifically without inhibiting any other protease yet tested in vitro (1. 3); also it does not inhibit lysosomal protein degradation in the cell (2). This is in contrast to other commonly used proteasome inhibitors. such as peptide aldehydes and 3. 4-dichloroisocoumarin. which inhibit a wide range of proteases.

We demonstrate here a positive role for RKIP in the regulation of cell locomotion. We discovered that RKIP is the relevant cellular target of locostatin. a cell migration inhibitor. Locostatin abrogates RKIP’s ability to bind and inhibit Raf-1 kinase. and it acts by disrupting a protein-protein interaction. an uncommon mode of action for a small molecule. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of RKIP expression also reduces cell migration rate. Overexpression of RKIP converts epithelial cells to a highly migratory fibroblast-like phenotype. with dramatic reduction in the sensitivity of cells to locostatin.

Although numerous GPCRs are sorted to a degradative pathway upon prolonged stimulation. the molecular events leading to degradation are poorly understood. Here we report that the human immunodeficiency virus co-receptor CXCR4 undergoes rapid agonist-promoted degradation by a process involving endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits and subsequent sorting to lysosomes. Studies analyzing the sorting of various CXCR4 mutants revealed the presence of a degradation motif (SSLKILSKGK) in the carboxyl terminus of CXCR4. The first two serines as well as the dileucine motif were critical for agonist-induced endocytosis. whereas all three serines but not the dileucine were important in mediating degradation.

GPCRs signal to diverse extracellular stimuli and control a vast number of physiological responses. making this receptor class the target of nearly half the drugs currently in use. In addition to rapid desensitization. receptor trafficking is crucial for the temporal and spatial control of GPCR signaling. Sorting signals present in the intracytosolic domains of GPCRs regulate trafficking through the endosomal-lysosomal system. GPCR internalization is mediated by serine and threonine phosphorylation and arrestin binding.

P25 and P28 are partially redundant in these functions. since the efficiency of ookinete/oocyst development is only mildly compromised in parasites lacking either P25 or P28 (Sko parasites) compared with that of Dko parasites.

Chemiluminescence (CL) is an energy product of phagocyte oxygenation activity. Measurement of this luminescence is nondestructive and allows continuous monitoring of phagocyte oxygenation activity. As an end product of the microbe-humoral-phagocyte interaction. phagocyte luminescence may also be used for assessing the functional interrelationships of the various reacting components. For example. when stimulus is not limiting. CL is proportional to the functional capacity of the phagocytes present. Likewise. if the number of phagocytes is not limiting. microbe opsonification kinetics can be studied as the rate of stimulated phagocyte oxygenation activity yielding CL.

As an end product of the microbe-humoral-phagocyte interaction. phagocyte luminescence may also be used for assessing the functional interrelationships of the various reacting components. For example. when stimulus is not limiting. CL is proportional to the functional capacity of the phagocytes present.

The RNA‐binding proteins that interact with these cis‐elements remained to be identified. Starting with the 3′ most localization element of ASH1 mRNA in the three‐hybrid assay. element E3. we isolated a clone corresponding to the C‐terminus of She3p. We also found that She3p and She2p interact. and this interaction is essential for the binding of She3p with element E3 in vivo. Moreover. She2p was observed to bind the E3 RNA directly in vitro and each of the ASH1 cis‐acting localization elements requires She2p for their localization function.

124939,Telomeric noncoding RNA TERRA is induced by telomere shortening to nucleate telomerase molecules at short telomeres,2013,Emilio Cusanelli and Carmina Angelica Perez Romero and Pascal Chartrand,51,Molecular cell,6,780-791,Cell Press,Elongation of a short telomere depends on the action of multiple telomerase molecules. which are visible as telomerase RNA foci or clusters associated with telomeres in yeast and mammalian cells. How several telomerase molecules act on a single short telomere is unknown. Herein. we report that the telomeric noncoding RNA TERRA is involved in the nucleation of telomerase molecules into clusters prior to their recruitment at a short telomere. We find that telomere shortening induces TERRA expression. leading to the accumulation of TERRA molecules into a nuclear focus. Simultaneous time-lapse imaging of telomerase RNA and TERRA reveals spontaneous events of telomerase nucleation on TERRA foci in early S phase. generating TERRA-telomerase clusters.

124942,Telomeric repeat-containing RNA TERRA: a noncoding RNA connecting telomere biology to genome integrity,2015,Emilio Cusanelli and Pascal Chartrand,6,,,143,Frontiers,Telomeres are dynamic nucleoprotein structures that protect the ends of chromosomes from degradation and activation of DNA damage response. For this reason. telomeres are essential to genome integrity. Chromosome ends are enriched in heterochromatic marks and proper organization of telomeric chromatin is important to telomere stability. Despite their heterochromatic state. telomeres are transcribed giving rise to long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) called TERRA (telomeric repeat-containing RNA). TERRA molecules play critical roles in telomere biology. including regulation of telomerase activity and heterochromatin formation at chromosome ends. Emerging evidence indicate that TERRA transcripts form DNA-RNA hybrids at chromosome ends which can promote homologous recombination among telomeres. delaying cellular senescence and sustaining genome instability. Intriguingly. TERRA RNA-telomeric DNA hybrids are involved in telomere length homeostasis of telomerase-negative cancer cells. Furthermore. TERRA transcripts play a role in the DNA damage response triggered by dysfunctional telomeres. We discuss here recent developments on TERRA’s role in telomere biology and genome integrity. and its implication in cancer.,True,V3DiUroAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,141,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2015.00143/full,14057819114838993767,/scholar?cites=14057819114838993767,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2015.00143/full,0,0,0

We now report that the RNA binding protein Khd1 interacts with the ASH1 mRNA localization element E1 and with the C-terminal domain of eIF4G1 to regulate the translation of this transcript. Khd1p reduces translation initiation on the ASH1 mRNA and diminishes Ash1p leakage into the mother cell nucleus.

DET acts to maintain the indeterminacy of the apical meristem during flowering. and consistent with this role. DET expression is limited to the shoot apex after floral initiation. LF delays the induction of flowering by lengthening the vegetative phase. and allelic variation at the LF locus is an important component of natural variation for flowering time in pea.

The Nervy homology 2 (NHR2) domain in ETO mediates oligomerization and AML1/ETO's interactions with ETO. MTGR1. and MTG16. and with the corepressor molecules mSin3A and HDAC1 and HDAC3. We solved the NHR2 domain structure and found it to be an α-helical tetramer. We show that oligomerization contributes to AML1/ETO's inhibition of granulocyte differentiation. is essential for its ability to enhance the clonogenic potential of primary mouse bone marrow cells. and affects AML1/ETO's activity on several endogenous genes.

Two ubiquitin receptors exist in the proteasome. S5a/Rpn10 and Rpn13. Whereas Rpn13 has only one ubiquitin-binding surface. S5a binds ubiquitin with two independent ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs). Here. we use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and analytical ultracentrifugation to define at atomic level resolution how S5a binds K48-linked diubiquitin. in which K48 of one ubiquitin subunit (the “proximal” one) is covalently bonded to G76 of the other (the “distal” subunit). We demonstrate that S5a's UIMs bind the two subunits simultaneously with a preference for UIM2 binding to the proximal subunit while UIM1 binds to the distal one. In addition.

In the present study the concentration of glutathione (GSH) was measured in excised calf trabecular meshwork (TM) and found to be 0.40 mu mol/g wet wt (0.027 mu mol/mg protein). Oxidized glutathione was not detectable in the tissue. TM was found to have significant hexose monophosphate shunt activity as determined by measurement of the oxidation of 14C-1 and 14C-6-labeled glucose in tissue homogenates. The concentration of GSH in TM of enucleated calf eyes could be totally depleted by infusion of medium containing both diamide. which is an oxidant of GSH. and 1. 3bis (2-chlorethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). which is an inhibitor of the enzyme glutathione reductase. The depletion of GSH was found to have no effect on the facility of aqueous outflow. Experiments were also done in which normal and TM GSH-depleted eyes were perfused with medium containing H202. Exposure to H202 produced no effect on outflow facility in the normal eyes but caused a 33% decrease in facility in eyes with the GSH-depleted TM. The results indicate that GSH may not participate directly in regulating aqueous humor outflow but is able to protect TM against H202-induced oxidative damage that would otherwise lead to a decrease in outflow facility.,True,B8FLM3gAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,150,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2159651,14282750986507329590,/scholar?cites=14282750986507329590,,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/arvo/content_public/journal/iovs/933116/1283.pdf,0,0,0
125050,The role of glutathione metabolism in the detoxification of H2O2 in rabbit lens.,1982,Frank J Giblin and Janet P McCready and Venkat N Reddy,22,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,3,330-335,The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology,Aqueous humor is known to contain a significant level of H2O2. but the mechanisms by which ocular tissues protect against oxidative damage are not well understood. With the use ofC-1-. C-2-. and C-6-labeled glucose. the contribution of glutathione (GSH) metabolism and the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMS) to the detoxification of peroxide in the lens his been evaluated. It teas observed that H202in the culture medium disappeared rapidly (0.5/xmol H202/lensIhr) upon incubation of a rabbit lens at 37 C. At 0 to 3 C. however. the rate of disappearance of H2O2 was only one fifth of that observed at the higher temperature. In the absence of a lens or after pretreatment of the lens with methyl mercuric hydroxide. the rate of disappearance of peroxide from the medium was reduced to nearly zero. When a nearly constant level of H2O2 (0.05 to 0.07 mM) was maintained in the medium by means of a peristaltic pump. the amount of C02 liberated by the HMS at 37 C was found to be three times that liberated from lenses cultured in the absence of peroxide. No change was noted in the level of GSH in the H20^-treated lenses at 37 C. A significant decrease in GSH was observed. however. at 0 to 3 C. suggesting nonenzymatic oxidation of the tripeptide at the lower temperature. The results indicate that GSH metabolism and the HMS pathway contribute significantly to the detoxification ofH2O2in the lens.(INVEST OPHTHALMOL VIS SCI 22: 330-335. 1982.),True,B8FLM3gAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,149,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frank_Giblin/publication/16138250_The_role_of_glutathione_metabolism_in_the_detoxification_of_H2O2_In_rabbit_lens/links/0fcfd50d48b725cd74000000/The-role-of-glutathione-metabolism-in-the-detoxification-of-H2O2-In-rabbit-lens.pdf,1374729447174744681,/scholar?cites=1374729447174744681,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frank_Giblin/publication/16138250_The_role_of_glutathione_metabolism_in_the_detoxification_of_H2O2_In_rabbit_lens/links/0fcfd50d48b725cd74000000/The-role-of-glutathione-metabolism-in-the-detoxification-of-H2O2-In-rabbit-lens.pdf,0,0,0

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the high concentration of aqueous ascorbate in diurnal animals protects the lens against ultraviolet (UV)-induced damage to the eye. This study compares the effect of UV-B-induced DNA strand breaks on the lens epithelia of guinea pigs and rats after depletion or elevation of aqueous humor ascorbate. respectively. METHODS: Eyes of guinea pigs and rats were exposed to UV-B radiation (0.25-0.75 J/cm2 on the cornea) for 10 minutes. and DNA strand breaks in lens epithelium were measured by single-cell gel electrophoresis. Ascorbic acid concentration in the aqueous humor. lens. and lens-capsule epithelium were assayed by spectrophotometric and electrochemical methods. For depletion of aqueous humor and lens ascorbate in guinea pigs. the animals were maintained on an ascorbate-deficient diet. Aqueous ascorbic acid was elevated in the rat by intraperitoneal injections of sodium ascorbate (1 g/kg). RESULTS: The ascorbate concentration in the aqueous humor of the normal rat was approximately 3% that of the guinea pig. whereas the concentration of the compound in the lens of the normal rat was 10% that of the guinea pig. Guinea pigs fed an ascorbate-deficient diet showed a dramatic drop of more than 80% in aqueous humor ascorbate in the first week. whereas lens ascorbate decreased by approximately 25% during this time period.

125054,Glutathione and lens epithelial function.,1976,FJ Giblin and B Chakrapani and VN Reddy,15,Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science,5,381-393,The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology,The relationship of the concentration of glutathione (GSH) in lens epithelium to the transport of cations in the lens was studied by decreasing the level of GSH in the epithelium and monitoring subsequent effects in the lens on the distribution of cations. the activity of Na+-K+ ATPase and the uptake and efflux of 86Rb. Oxidation of GSH in cultured rabbit lenses was accomplished by the use of 1 mM tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). a reagent which appears to be suitable for the specific oxidation of GSH in this tissue. The concentration of GSH found in the normal lens epithelium was estimated to be 64 mum per gram wet weight or nearly six times that present in the whole lens. A decrease in the concentration of GSH in lens epithelium of 60 per cent or more leads to an increase in hydration. a shift in the distribution of Na+. K+. and Cl-. a decrease in the activity of Na+-K+ ATPase. and a decrease in the active transport. and an increase in the passive diffusion of 86Rb. In the TBHP-treated lenses there is a rapid decrease in the production of lactate. possibly as a result of the inhibition of Na+-K+ ATPase. but the effect on the level of lens ATP is delayed and less pronounced. It appears that the adverse effect on membrane permeability caused by the oxidation of GSH is partially reversed when a high level of GSH returns to the epithelium. However. the decrease in active transport of 86Rb and the inactivation of Na+-K+ ATPase are not reversed by either regeneration of GSH in the tissue or by treatment with exogenous dithiothreitol and may indicate an irreversible conformational change in the enzyme initiated by the loss of the protective effect of GSH …,True,B8FLM3gAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,122,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2175319,7907471950158777177,/scholar?cites=7907471950158777177,,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/arvo/content_public/journal/iovs/933300/381.pdf,0,0,0
125055,Metabolism and function of glutathione in the lens,1984,VENKAT N Reddy and Frank J Giblin,106,Ciba Found Symp,,65-87,,The mammalian lens contains an unusually high concentration of glutathione (GSH). the highest level being in the epithelium. GSH is present largely in the reduced state. The high concentration of GSH in a normal lens and the decreased concentration in most types of cataracts have led to many hypotheses on its role in cataract formation. These hypotheses are considered in the light of current evidence. GSH is synthesized and degraded in the lens. Both processes require ATP. derived largely from glycolysis. Carbohydrate metabolism is also involved in the maintenance of GSH in the reduced state. There is a direct link between the rate of formation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and the stimulation of the hexose monophosphate shunt through the generation of NADPH.One possible function of GSH in the lens is to maintain the thiol (SH) groups of proteins in the reduced state. thus preventing formation of high …,True,B8FLM3gAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,117,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9780470720875#page=75,8628755480422850588,/scholar?cites=8628755480422850588,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Garner2/publication/16627284_Non-Invasive_Techniques_in_the_Study_of_Cataract_Development_at_the_Metabolic_and_Protein_Molecular_Level/links/5bb0f32b299bf13e605854af/Non-Invasive-Techniques-in-the-Study-of-Cataract-Development-at-the-Metabolic-and-Protein-Molecular-Level.pdf#page=75,0,0,0

125068,Plant development: regulation by protein degradation,2002,Hanjo Hellmann and Mark Estelle,297,,5582,793-797,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Many aspects of eukaryotic development depend on regulated protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This highly conserved pathway promotes covalent attachment of ubiquitin to protein substrates through the sequential action of three enzymes called a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). and a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). Most ubiquitinated proteins are then targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome. Recent studies have also shown that the ubiquitin-related protein RUB/Nedd8 and the proteasome-related COP9 signalosome complex cooperate with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to promote protein degradation. Most of these components are conserved in all three eukaryotic kingdoms. However. the known targets of the pathway in plants. and the developmental processes they regulate. are specific to the plant kingdom.,True,WEAZBjsAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,391,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/297/5582/793.abstract,3378323941848450667,/scholar?cites=3378323941848450667,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.385.6826&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

A family of low- and high-affinity sucrose transporters (SUT) was identified. SUT1 serves as a high-affinity transporter essential for phloem loading and long-distance transport in solanaceous species. SUT4 is a low-affinity transporter with an expression pattern overlapping that of SUT1. Both SUT1 and SUT4 localize to enucleate sieve elements of tomato. New sucrose transporter–like proteins. named SUT2. from tomato and Arabidopsis contain extended cytoplasmic domains. thus structurally resembling the yeast sugar sensors SNF3 and RGT2.

Among the several classes of ubiquitin E3 ligases. the Skp1‐Cullin‐F‐box (SCF) class is generally comprised of three ‘core’ subunits: Skp1 and Cullin. plus at least one F‐box protein (FBP) subunit that imparts specificity for the ubiquitination of selected target proteins. Recent genetic and biochemical evidence in Arabidopsis thaliana suggests that post‐translational turnover of proteins mediated by SCF complexes is important for the regulation of diverse developmental and environmental response pathways.

For many years the sole function of vitamin B6 was considered to be that of an enzymatic cofactor. However. recently it became clear that it is also a potent antioxidant that effectively quenches reactive oxygen species and is thus of high importance for cellular well-being. In view of the recent findings. the current review takes a look back and summarizes the discovery of vitamin B6 and the elucidation of its structure and biosynthetic pathways. It provides a detailed overview on vitamin B6 both as a cofactor and a protective compound. Besides these general characteristics of the vitamin. the review also outlines the current literature on vitamin B6 derivatives and elaborates on recent findings that provide new insights into transport and catabolism of the compound and on its impact on human health.

We investigated the mechanism that governs the early expression of Hoxb4 and found that transient signaling from the paraxial mesoderm induces expression in the hindbrain. Induction involves a retinoid pathway requiring retinoic acid receptor (RAR) function within the neural plate. Characterization of a prerhombomeric enhancer from Hoxb4 reveals that a retinoic acid (RA) response element is an essential component of the early neural response to somite (s) signaling and can interpret positional information for setting the anterior boundary of expression. These data suggest a mechanism whereby. during normal hindbrain development. Hoxb4 expression is initiated by extrinsic signals and is subsequently maintained by Hox feedback circuits.

CR3 mediates transcriptional activation by multiple Hox genes. including Hoxb4. Hoxd4. and Hoxb5 but not Hoxb1. It also functions as a selective HOX response element in Drosophila. where activation depends on Deformed. Sex combs reduced. and Antennapedia but not labial.

During Drosophila development. glial cells provide a niche that sustains the proliferation of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) during starvation. We now find that the glial cell niche also preserves neuroblast proliferation under conditions of hypoxia and oxidative stress. Lipid droplets that form in niche glia during oxidative stress limit the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibit the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). These droplets protect glia and also neuroblasts from peroxidation chain reactions that can damage many types of macromolecules. The underlying antioxidant mechanism involves diverting PUFAs. including diet-derived linoleic acid. away from membranes to the core of lipid droplets. where they are less vulnerable to peroxidation.

Their capacity to divide is modulated along the anterior-posterior body axis. but the mechanism underlying this is unclear. We use clonal analysis of identified precursors in the abdomen to show that neuron production stops because the cell death program is activated in the neuroblast while it is still engaged in the cell cycle. A burst of expression of the Hox protein Abdominal-A (AbdA) specifies the time at which apoptosis occurs. thereby determining the final number of progeny that each neuroblast generates.

Here. we use Drosophila to explore the as yet unknown mechanisms regulating this privileged tissue growth. As in mammals. we observe in Drosophila that the CNS is more highly spared than other tissues during nutrient restriction (NR). We demonstrate that anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) efficiently protects neural progenitor (neuroblast) growth against reductions in amino acids and insulin-like peptides during NR via two mechanisms. First. Alk suppresses the growth requirement for amino acid sensing via Slimfast/Rheb/TOR complex 1. And second. Alk. rather than insulin-like receptor. primarily activates PI3-kinase.

Particularly powerful applications of these include structural studies of multidomain proteins. macromolecular complexes. and deuterated molecules. Residual dipolar couplings can be measured if a weak molecular alignment is achieved in the presence of the magnetic field. Some macromolecules. for example. DNA. have sufficient magnetic susceptibility anisotropy that a small amount of alignment is inherent during the NMR experiment. 2 More generally. it is necessary to induce additional alignment by dissolving …,True,LV3JeCUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,189,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ja000764e,7661501746142947604,/scholar?cites=7661501746142947604,,,0,0,0

Central to this schema are members of the phospholipase C (PLC) superfamily. which relay information from the activated receptor to downstream signal cascades by production of second-messenger molecules. Recent studies reveal that. in addition to its enzymatic activity. PLC-γ regulates Ca2+ entry via the formation of an intermolecular lipid-binding domain with canonical transient receptor potential 3 (TRPC3) ion channels. This complex. in turn. controls TRPC3 trafficking and cell-surface expression. Thus. TRPC3 ion channels are functionally linked to both lipase-dependent and -independent activities of PLC-γ.

Similarities and differences between the proteases expressed in different species may give valuable insights into their physiological roles and evolution. We have performed a comparative analysis of protease genes in the two sequenced dicot genomes. Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa by using genes coding for proteases in the MEROPS database [1] for Arabidopsis to identify homologous sequences in Populus. A multigene-based phylogenetic analysis was performed. Most protease families were found to be larger in Populus than in Arabidopsis. reflecting recent genome duplication. Detailed studies on e.g. the DegP. Clp. FtsH. Lon. rhomboid and papain-Like protease families showed the pattern of gene family expansion and gene loss was complex. We finally show that different Populus tissues express unique suites of protease genes and that the mRNA levels of different classes of proteases change along a developmental gradient.

There was a need in the fields of rockct. missile and satellite technology for transparent materials which were transparent to infra-red radiation and capable of withstanding high temperatures. Materials with suitable high-temperature characteristics are the polycrystalline ceramics. but these are often opaque. Their opacity is caused by failure to achieve theoretical density. by the presenco of grain boundary cracks resulting from abnormal grain growth. and also by the presence of a second phase or precipitate often due to the presence of additives intendod to promote sintering.

MA,Autophagy and autophagocytosis are terms given to a membrane-mediated process in eukaryotic cells in which portions of cytoplasm are sequestered within vacuoles and degraded by acid hydrolases acquired by fusion with lysosomes. Although vacuoles of this type may be formed under pathologic conditions. autophagy is fundamentally a physiological process that plays indispensable roles in cell restructuring and in the ongoing turnover of cellular protein and other macromolecules. Cytoplasmic sequestration is the one step in this pathway that distinguishes autophagy from other degradative processes in the cell. It is relatively nonselective as a volume uptake mechanism (one apparent exception is discussed in Section 3.1.2). Accordingly. most organelles and macromolecules are subject to vacuolar isolation in proportion to their cytoplasmic abundance.

Thus. phage display of glutathione transferase affords a system for engineering novel binding specificities onto the pre-existing protein framework of the enzyme.f2,True,p3HcwsoAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,143,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283685703622,11248105337849002177,/scholar?cites=11248105337849002177,,,0,0,0

125295,Human class Mu glutathione transferases. in particular isoenzyme M2-2. catalyze detoxication of the dopamine metabolite aminochrome,1997,Juan Segura-Aguilar and Sofia Baez and Mikael Widersten and Christopher J Welch and Bengt Mannervik,272,Journal of Biological Chemistry,9,5727-5731,Elsevier,Human glutathione transferases (GSTs) were shown to catalyze the reductive glutathione conjugation of aminochrome (2.3-dihydroindole-5.6-dione). The class Mu enzyme GST M2-2 displayed the highest specific activity (148 μmol/min/mg). whereas GSTs A1-1. A2-2. M1-1. M3-3. and P1-1 had markedly lower activities (<1 μmol/min/mg). The product of the conjugation. with a UV spectrum exhibiting absorption peaks at 277 and 295 nm. was 4-S-glutathionyl-5.6-dihydroxyindoline as determined by NMR spectroscopy. In contrast to reduced forms of aminochrome (leucoaminochrome and o-semiquinone). 4-S-glutathionyl-5.6-dihydroxyindoline was stable in the presence of molecular oxygen. superoxide radicals. and hydrogen peroxide. However. the strongly oxidizing complex of Mn3+ and pyrophosphate oxidizes 4-S-glutathionyl-5.6-dihydroxyindoline to 4-S-glutathionylaminochrome. a new quinone derivative with …,True,p3HcwsoAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,131,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818412653,1253545386291320642,/scholar?cites=1253545386291320642,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818412653,0,0,0
125296,Functional significance of arginine 15 in the active site of human class alpha glutathione transferase A1-1,1995,Robert Björnestedt and Gun Stenberg and Mikael Widersten and Philip G Board and Irmgard Sinning and T Alwyn Jones and Bengt Mannervik,247,Journal of molecular biology,4,765-773,Academic Press,Arg15 is a conserved active-site residue in class Alpha glutathione transferases. X-ray diffraction studies of human glutathione transferase A1-1 have shown that No of this amino acid residue is adjacent to the sulfur atom of a glutathione derivative bound to the active site. suggesting the presence of a hydrogen bond. The phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr9 also forms a hydrogen bond to the sulfur atom of glutathione. and removal of this hydroxyl group causes partial inactivation of the enzyme. The present study demonstrates by use of site-directed mutagenesis the functional significance of Arg15 for catalysis. Mutation of Arg15 into Leu reduced the catalytic activity by 25-fold. whereas substitution by Lys caused only a threefold decrease. indicating the significance of a positively charged residue at position 15. Mutation of Arg15 into Ala or His caused a substantial reduction of the specific activity (200 or 400-fold …,True,p3HcwsoAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,116,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283605801548,7771203237942418214,/scholar?cites=7771203237942418214,,,0,0,0
125297,Effects of insulin-like growth factor I on the rates of glucose transport and utilization in rat skeletal muscle in vitro,1992,G Dimitriadis and M Parry-Billings and S Bevan and D Dunger and T Piva and U Krause and G Wegener and EA Newsholme,285,Biochemical Journal,1,269-274,Portland Press Ltd.,1. The effects of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on the rates of glucose transport and utilization and its interaction with insulin were investigated in rat soleus muscle in vitro. IGF-I increased the rates of glucose transport. lactate formation. glycogen synthesis and the flux of glucose to hexose monophosphate. but it had no effect on the rate of glucose oxidation or glycogenolysis. 2. In the absence of insulin. low levels of IGF-I (0-30 ng/ml) increased the rate of glycolysis and the content of fructose 2.6-bisphosphate. but the content of glucose 6-phosphate remained unaltered; at higher levels of IGF-I (300-3000 ng/ml) the rate of glycolysis and the content of fructose 2.6-bisphosphate showed a further modest increase. but the content of glucose 6-phosphate doubled. Similar changes were seen when the level of insulin was increased from basal (0-0.4 ng/ml) to maximal (40 ng/ml). 3.

Since then. this topic has received increasing attention. and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus. it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews. there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy. especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here. we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes. and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes.
