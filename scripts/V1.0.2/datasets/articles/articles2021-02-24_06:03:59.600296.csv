1069036,Localization and activation of glucagon-like peptide-2 receptors on vagal afferents in the rat,2007,David W Nelson and James W Sharp and Mark S Brownfield and Helen E Raybould and Denise M Ney,148,Endocrinology,5,1954-1962,Oxford University Press,Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a nutrient-dependent proglucagon-derived hormone that stimulates intestinal growth through poorly understood paracrine and/or neural pathways. The relationship between GLP-2 action and a vagal pathway is unclear. Our aims were to determine whether 1) the GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) is expressed on vagal afferents by localizing it to the nodose ganglia; 2) exogenous GLP-2 stimulates the vagal afferent pathway by determining immunoreactivity for c-fos protein in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS); and 3) functional ablation of vagal afferents attenuates GLP-2-mediated intestinal growth in rats maintained with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). A polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of the rat GLP-2R was raised and characterized. The GLP-2R was localized to vagal afferents in the nodose ganglia and confirmed in enteroendocrine cells. enteric neurons. and nerve fibers …,True,OITXv2wAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,102,https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/148/5/1954/2501504,1025688151518279387,/scholar?cites=1025688151518279387,,https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/148/5/1954/2501504,0,0,0

TPN rats showed small bowel mucosal hyperplasia at 8 h through 7 days after resection. demonstrating that exogenous luminal nutrients are not essential for resection-induced adaptation when residual ileum and colon are present. Increased enterocyte proliferation was a stronger determinant of resection-induced mucosal growth in orally fed animals. whereas decreased apoptosis showed a greater effect in TPN animals.

1069040,Intestinal triacylglycerol synthesis in fat absorption and systemic energy metabolism,2015,Chi-Liang Eric Yen and David W Nelson and Mei-I Yen,56,,3,489-501,Elsevier,The intestine plays a prominent role in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol (triglyceride; TAG). Digested dietary TAG is repackaged in the intestine to form the hydrophobic core of chylomicrons. which deliver metabolic fuels. essential fatty acids. and other lipid-soluble nutrients to the peripheral tissues. By controlling the flux of dietary fat into the circulation. intestinal TAG synthesis can greatly impact systemic metabolism. Genes encoding many of the enzymes involved in TAG synthesis have been identified. Among TAG synthesis enzymes. acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 and acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)1 are highly expressed in the intestine. Their physiological functions have been examined in the context of whole organisms using genetically engineered mice and. in the case of DGAT1. specific inhibitors.

Here. we report that loss of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan. syndecan-1. causes a profoundly depleted intradermal fat layer. which provides crucial thermogenic insulation for mammals. Mice without syndecan-1 enter torpor upon fasting and show multiple indicators of cold stress. including activation of the stress checkpoint p38α in brown adipose tissue. liver and lung. The metabolic phenotype in mutant mice. including reduced liver glycogen. is rescued by housing at thermoneutrality. suggesting that reduced insulation in cool temperatures underlies the observed phenotypes. We find that syndecan-1. which functions as a facultative lipoprotein uptake receptor. is required for adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Intradermal fat shows highly dynamic differentiation. continuously expanding and involuting in response to hair cycle and ambient temperature. This physiology probably confers a unique role for Sdc1 in this adipocyte sub-type. The PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone rescues Sdc1−/− intradermal adipose tissue. placing PPARγ downstream of Sdc1 in triggering adipocyte differentiation.

Animal models of PAE display glucose intolerance and increased adiposity. suggesting that PAE causes metabolic reprogramming. We tested this hypothesis in a mouse model of binge PAE. wherein pregnant C57Bl/6J females received 3 g/kg alcohol (ETOH) daily from gestational day 12.5 to 17.5; maltodextrin (MD) and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) served as isocaloric nutritional controls. and sham (H2O) treatment controlled for gavage stress. Our comprehensive assessment quantified body composition. energy expenditure. glucose tolerance. and cardiovascular function in offspring at age 17 weeks.

Reef corals that brood their larvae internally and release mature larvae are believed to show little exchange of larvae over ecological times scales and are therefore expected to recover extremely slowly from large-scale perturbations.  Methodology/Principal Findings Using analysis of ten DNA microsatellite loci. we show that although Great Barrier Reef (GBR) populations of the brooding coral. Seriatopora hystrix. are mostly self-seeded and some populations are highly isolated. a considerable amount of sexual larvae (up to ∼4%) has been exchanged among several reefs 10 s to 100 s km apart over the past few generations. Our results further indicate that S. hystrix is capable of producing asexual propagules with similar long-distance dispersal abilities (∼1.4% of the sampled colonies had a multilocus genotype that also occurred at another sampling location). which may aid in recovery from environmental disturbances.

1069112,A quantitative profiling method of phytohormones and other metabolites applied to barley roots subjected to salinity stress,2017,Da Cao and Adrian Lutz and Camilla Beate Hill and Damien L Callahan and Ute Roessner,7,Frontiers in Plant Science,,,Frontiers,As integral parts of plant signaling networks. phytohormones are involved in the regulation of plant metabolism and growth under adverse environmental conditions. including salinity. Globally. salinity is one of the most severe abiotic stressors with an estimated 800 million hectares of arable land affected. Roots are the first plant organ to sense salinity in the soil. and are the initial site of sodium (Na+) exposure. However. the quantification of phytohormones in roots is challenging. as they are often present at extremely low levels compared to other plant tissues. To overcome this challenge. we developed a high-throughput LC-MS method to quantify ten endogenous phytohormones and their metabolites of diverse chemical classes in roots of barley. This method was validated in a salinity stress experiment with six barley varieties grown hydroponically with and without salinity. In addition to phytohormones. we quantified fifty-two polar primary metabolites. including some phytohormone precursors. using established GC-MS and LC-MS methods. Phytohormone and metabolite data were correlated with physiological measurements including biomass. plant size and chlorophyll content. Root and leaf elemental analysis was performed to determine Na+ exclusion and K+ retention ability in the studied barley varieties.

Acropora millepora. during experimentally-induced bleaching under ecologically relevant conditions. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to quantify the states of these two pools. together with physiological parameters assessing the general state of the symbiosis (including photosystem II photochemical efficiency. chlorophyll concentration and Symbiodinium cell densities). The results show that the responses of the two antioxidant systems occur on different timescales: (i) the redox state of the Symbiodinium PQ pool remained stable until twelve days into the experiment. after which there was an abrupt oxidative shift; (ii) by contrast. an oxidative shift of approximately 10% had occurred in the host CoQ pool after 6 days of thermal stress. prior to significant changes in any other physiological parameter measured. Host CoQ pool oxidation is thus an early biomarker of thermal stress in corals. and this antioxidant pool is likely to play a key role in quenching thermally-induced ROS in the coral-algal symbiosis.

For many species the genetic composition is not homogeneous and is determined. in part. by the character of the complex dispersal pathways that connect the populations situated on each coral reef. One method of measuring these genetic connections is to examine the microsatellite composition of individual corals and then statistically compare populations across the region. We use these connection strengths. derived from a population similarity measure. to create complex networks to describe and analyse the genetic exchange of the brooding coral. Seriatopora hystrix. The network. based on determining the putative parental origin of individual coral colonies. involved sampling 2163 colonies from 47 collection sites and examining 10 microsatellites. A dispersal network was created from the genetic distance DLR values that measure the genetic similarity of each population (defined by the local sampling effort) to every other sampled population based on the microsatellite composition. Graph theory methods show that this network exhibited infrequent long distance links and population clustering which is commonly referred to as small world topology.

These microbes may be pathogenic. mutualistic or commensal. Hence. the health and survival of plants is heavily reliant on their ability to perceive different microbial lifestyles and respond appropriately. Emerging research suggests that there is a pivotal role for plant root secondary metabolites in responding to microbial colonization. However. it is largely unknown if plants are able to differentiate between microbes of different lifestyles and respond differently during the earliest stages of pre-symbiosis (i.e. prior to physical contact). By studying. here. plant responses to a range of microbial isolates. we questioned: (1) if individual microbes of different lifestyles and species caused alterations to the plant root metabolome during pre-symbiosis. and (2) if these early metabolite responses correlate with the outcome of the symbiotic interaction in later phases of colonization.

However. many species produce similar colours using self-synthesised pteridine pigments. A compelling but untested hypothesis is that pteridines compensate for low environmental availability of carotenoids because it is metabolically cheaper to synthesise pteridines than to acquire and sequester carotenoids. Based on a phylogenetic comparative analysis of 11 pigment concentrations in skin tissue of agamid lizards. we show that pteridine concentrations are higher and carotenoid concentrations lower in less productive environments. Both carotenoid and pteridine pigments were present in all species. but only pteridine concentrations explained colour variation among species. Furthermore. pigment concentrations were uncorrelated with indices of sexual selection. These results suggest that variation among species in pteridine synthesis compensates for environmental availability of carotenoids and challenge the paradigm of honest carotenoid signalling in vertebrates with complex colour production mechanisms.,True,gaHMdO8AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,0,https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.22541/au.161132817.77514172,,,,https://www.authorea.com/doi/pdf/10.22541/au.161132817.77514172,0,0,0

This poses a serious threat to public health nowadays. In addition. traditional pathogen-based detection methods may not be able to report an infection from an unknown type or a subtype of virus if its nucleotide sequence is not known. Because of these factors. targeting host microRNA signatures may be an alternative to classify infections and distinguish types of pathogens as microRNAs are produced in humans shortly after infection. Although this approach is in its infant stage. there is an urgent need to develop a rapid reporter assay for microRNA for disease control and prevention.

In this work we report on the sat encoded dissimilatory ATP sulfurylase from the sulfur-oxidizing purple sulfur bacterium Allochromatium vinosum. In this organism. the sat gene is located in one operon and co-transcribed with the aprMBA genes for membrane-bound APS reductase. Like APS reductase. Sat is dispensible for growth on reduced sulfur compounds due to the presence of an alternate. so far unidentified sulfite-oxidizing pathway in A. vinosum. Sulfate assimilation also proceeds independently of Sat by a separate pathway involving a cysDN-encoded assimilatory ATP sulfurylase. We produced the purple bacterial sat-encoded ATP sulfurylase as a recombinant protein in E. coli. determined crucial kinetic parameters and obtained a crystal structure in an open state with a ligand-free active site. By comparison with several known structures of the ATPS-APS complex in the closed state a scenario about substrate-induced conformational changes was worked out.

Cancer cells can process nutrient molecules differently from normal cells and use it to overcome stress imposed on them by various therapies. This metabolic conversion is controlled by specific genetic mutations that are associated with activation of oncogenes and loss of tumour suppressor proteins. Understanding these processes is important as it can lead to the discovery of biomarkers that can predict the aggressiveness of the disease and its response to therapy. and even more importantly. to the development of novel therapeutics. A classic tumour in this respect is clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Diethylphosphoryl oximes (DEP-OX) that were generated in situ were demonstrated in the past to be unstable. yet were more potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) than the parent OPs. In view of the inconsistencies among reported results. and the potential toxicity of POXs. it seemed important to characterize authentic DEP-OXs. and to evaluate their interference with reactivation of diethylphosphoryl-ChE (DEP-ChE) conjugates.

1069285,Combined effect of organophosphorus hydrolase and oxime on the reactivation rate of diethylphosphoryl-acetylcholinesterase conjugates,1998,Yacov Ashani and Haim Leader and Nathan Rothschild and Carlos Dosoretz,55,Biochemical pharmacology,2,159-168,Elsevier,Reactivation of inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is essential for rapid recovery after organophosphate (OP) poisoning. However. following administration of an oxime reactivator. such as pralidoxime mesylate (P2S). in patients poisoned with certain diethylphosphorothioate pesticides. no reactivation is observed. presumably due to reinhibition by circulating anti-cholinesterase OPs. Pretreatment alone with organophosphorus hydrolases (OPH) that are capable of rapidly hydrolyzing OPs was demonstrated. in animals. to confer significant protection against OP toxicity. One strategy to augment the potentially therapeutic scope of OPHs is a combined post-exposure treatment consisting of a drug(s) commonly used against OP toxicity and a suitable hydrolase. In this study. we examined the in vitro ability of OPH from Pseudomonas sp. (OPHps) to prevent reinhibition of P2S-reactivated AChE by excess OPs.

Enzyme entrapment was studied in the range of 0.01–0.25 U. and compared with the activity of the free. non-immobilized enzyme. The reaction catalyzed by the entrapped enzyme was almost two orders of magnitude slower than with the free enzyme. Addition of surfactants slightly increased the parathion hydrolysis rate. and the addition of ethanol almost doubled it. However. this increase of reaction rate cannot by itself explain the decrease of activity. suggesting that irreversible damage to the enzyme during gelation. rather than diffusion limitation throughout the gel-glass structure. is the main cause for the decrease of activity. Regardless of damage to the enzyme during gelation. the remaining entrapped active fraction displayed stability even after eleven days. during successive cycles …,True,-4yuXVAAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,35,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00401877,5750213321962006857,/scholar?cites=5750213321962006857,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49472480/bf0040187720161009-3952-1i0q673.pdf,0,0,0

Boston. MA,Several quaternary oxime reactivators of phosphorylated cholinesterases (ChE) are effective antidotes in organophosphates (OP) toxicity. Reactivation of OP-inhibited ChEs probably proceeds via nucleophilic displacement which causes the accumulation of a phosphorylated oxime (POX) intermediate. Several POXs that were generated in situ over the last 4 decades from a variety of oxime antidotes and OPs. have been demonstrated to be more potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) than the parent OPs (1. 2). Their rapid removal is expected to improve therapeutic management of OP toxicity by oxime antidotes (1).

Among them. cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are responsible for a 47% of worldwide mortality. In general. preventive approaches modifying lifestyle are more cost-effective than treatments after disease onset. In this sense. a healthy diet could help a range of NCDs. such as cancer and CVDs. Traditional Mediterranean Diet (MD) is associated by the low-prevalence of certain types of cancers and CVDs. where olive oil plays an important role. In fact. different epidemiological studies suggest that olive oil consumption prevents some cancers. as well as coronary heart diseases and stroke incidence and mortality. Historically. the beneficial health effects of virgin olive oil (VOO) intake were first attributed to the high concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids. Nowadays. many studies indicate that phenolic compounds contained in olive oil have positive effects on different biomarkers related to health. Among them. phenolic compounds would be partially responsible for health benefits. The present work aims to explore. in studies published during the last five years. the effects of the main phenolic compounds isolated from olive oil on different cancer or CVD aspects. in order to clarify which compounds have more potential to be used as nutraceuticals with preventive or even therapeutic properties.

Healthy dietary patterns. with abundant fruit and vegetable consumption. may prevent the onset of these risk factors due to the presence of phytochemical compounds. Strawberries are known for their high content of polyphenols; among them. flavonoids are the major constituents. and it is presumed that they are responsible for the biological activity of the fruit. Nevertheless. there are only a few studies that actually evaluate the effects of different fractions isolated from strawberries.

The results showed that the synergic topical use of strawberry and Coenzyme Q 10 provided a significant (p< 0.05) photoprotective effect. reducing cell death and ROS. increasing antioxidant defense. lowering inflammatory markers. and improving mitochondrial functionality. The obtained results suggest the use of strawberry-based formulations as an innovative. natural. and useful tool for the prevention of UVA exposure-induced skin diseases in order to decrease or substitute the amount of synthetic sunscreen agents.

It is the handling of fat and/or excessive energy intake that encompasses the linkage of inflammation. oxidation. and metabolism to the deleterious effects associated with the continuous excess of food ingestion. The roles of cytokines and insulin resistance in excessive energy intake have been studied extensively. Tobacco use and obesity accompanied by an unhealthy diet and physical inactivity are the main factors that underlie noncommunicable diseases. The implication is that the management of energy or food intake. which is the main role of mitochondria. is involved in the most common diseases. In this study. we highlight the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in the mutual relationships between causative conditions. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that fuse and divide in response to environmental stimuli. developmental status. and energy requirements. These organelles act to supply the cell with ATP and to synthesise key molecules in the processes of inflammation. oxidation. and metabolism.

The paraoxonases (PON) are a group of antioxidant enzymes. termed PON1. PON2. and PON3 that protect lipoproteins and cells from peroxidation and. as such. may be involved in protection against the atherosclerosis process. PON1 inhibits the production of chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) in endothelial cells incubated with oxidized lipoproteins. PON1 and CCL2 are ubiquitously distributed in tissues. and this suggests a joint localization and combined systemic effect. The aim of the present study has been to analyze the quantitative immunohistochemical localization of PON1. PON3. CCL2 and CCL2 receptors in a series of patients with severe PAD. Portions of femoral and/or popliteal arteries from 66 patients with PAD were obtained during surgical procedures for infra-inguinal limb revascularization. We used eight normal arteries from donors as controls. PON1 and PON3. CCL2 and the chemokine-binding protein 2. and Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor. were increased in PAD patients. There were no significant changes in C–C chemokine receptor type 2.

In turn. inflammation. oxidation. and metabolism are associated with the course of these diseases; mitochondrial dysfunction seems to be at the crossroads of mutual relationships. The migration of immune cells during inflammation is governed by the interaction between chemokines and chemokine receptors. Chemokines. especially C-C-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). have a variety of additional functions that are involved in the maintenance of normal metabolism. It is our hypothesis that a ubiquitous and continuous secretion of CCL2 may represent an animal model of low-grade chronic inflammation that. in the presence of an energy surplus. could help to ascertain the afore-mentioned relationships and/or to search for specific therapeutic approaches.

Metformin is a strong candidate to be incorporated in alternative therapeutic approaches. We used a targeted metabolomic approach to assess changes related to the multi-faceted metabolic disturbances provoked by HFD. We evaluated the protective effects of metformin and explored how pro-inflammatory and metabolic changes respond when mice rendered obese. glucose-intolerant and hyperlipidemic were switched to diet reversal with or without metformin. Mice treated with metformin and diet-reversal showed a dramatically improved protection against HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. a beneficial effect that was accompanied by a lowering of liver-infiltrating pro-inflammatory macrophages and lower release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Metformin combined with diet reversal promoted effective weight loss along with better glucose control. lowered levels of circulating cholesterol and triglycerides. and reduced adipose tissue content. Our findings underscored the ability of metformin to target the contribution of branched chain amino acids to adipose tissue metabolism while suppressing mitochondrial-dependent biosynthesis in hepatic tissue. The relationship between adipose tissue and liver might provide clinical potential for combining metformin and dietary modifications to protect against the metabolic damage occurring upon excessive dietary fat intake.

The activity of this enzyme has been shown to be decreased in breast cancer (BC) patients. The aims of our study were to investigate the changes produced by radiotherapy (RT) on activity and concentration of serum PON1 in BC patients. and to evaluate the observed variations in relation to clinical and pathological characteristics of patients and tumors. and the response to treatment. We studied 200 women with BC who were scheduled to receive RT following excision of the tumor. Blood for analyses was obtained before and after the irradiation procedure. The control group was composed of 200 healthy women. Relative to control. BC patients had significantly lower serum PON1 activities pre-RT. while PON1 concentrations were at similar levels. RT was associated with a significant increase in serum PON1 activities and concentrations. We observed significant differences in serum PON1 concentrations post-RT between patients with luminal A or luminal B tumors. Serum PON1 concentration post-RT was markedly lower in BC patients with metastases. We conclude that benefit from RT accrues to the BC patients not only through its direct effect on cancer cells but also indirectly by improving the organism’s anti-oxidant defense mechanisms.

Lifestyle and pharmacological treatments are usually prescribed for prevention. Vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol). as an anti-atherogenic agent. is being taken into consideration due to its potential beneficial effects in lipid metabolism and its anti-inflammatory potency. To assess the effects of vitamin D 3 in the postprandial lipid profile in obese. vitamin D-deficient women. a non-targeted lipidomics approach using liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole time-of flight mass spectrometer was used to identify and quantitate a wide-range of circulating lipid species. including diglycerides. lysophosphatidylcholines. phosphatidylcholines. phosphatidylethanolamines. sphingomyelins and triglycerides. The most important changes were found in plasmatic sphingomyelin levels. which experience a decrease after vitamin D 3 intake.

Spain,2020,Simona Iftimie and Ana F López-Azcona and Manuel Vicente-Miralles and Ramon Descarrega-Reina and Anna Hernández-Aguilera and Francesc Riu and Josep M Simó and Pedro Garrido and Jorge Joven and Jordi Camps and Antoni Castro,15,PloS one,9,e0234452,Public Library of Science,Spain is one of the countries that has suffered the most from the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). the strain that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However. there is a lack of information on the characteristics of this disease in the Spanish population. The objective of this study has been to characterize our patients from an epidemiological point of view and to identify the risk factors associated with mortality in our geographical area. We performed a prospective. longitudinal study on 188 hospitalized cases of SARS-Cov-2 infection in Hospital Universitari de Sant Joan. in Reus. Spain. admitted between 15th March 2020 and 30th April 2020. We recorded demographic data. signs and symptoms and comorbidities. We also calculated the Charlson and McCabe indices. A total of 43 deaths occurred during the study period. Deceased patients were older than the survivors (77.7 ± 13.1 vs. 62.8 ± 18.4 years; p < 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that fever. pneumonia. acute respiratory distress syndrome. diabetes mellitus and cancer were the variables that showed independent and statistically significant associations with mortality. The Charlson index was more efficient than the McCabe index in discriminating between deceased and survivors. This is one of the first studies to describe the factors associated with mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain. and one of the few in the Mediterranean area. We identified the main factors independently associated with mortality in our population.

The chain collapse that accompanies protein folding involves extrusion of water from the nonpolar core.

However. the debate continues as to whether the core of the collapsed intermediate state is hydrated and. if so. what the dynamic nature of this water is. A key challenge is that protein hydration dynamics is significantly heterogeneous. yet suitable experimental techniques for measuring hydration dynamics with site-specificity are lacking.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Recent evidence suggests that proteins at equilibrium can exist in a manifold of conformational substates. and that these substates play important roles in protein function. Therefore. there is great interest in identifying regions in proteins that are in conformational exchange. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of spin‐labeled proteins containing the nitroxide side chain (R1) often consist of two (or more) components that may arise from slow exchange between conformational substates (lifetimes > 100 ns). However. crystal structures of proteins containing R1 have shown that multicomponent spectra can also arise from equilibria between rotamers of the side chain itself. In this report. it is shown that these scenarios can be distinguished by the response of the system to solvent perturbation with stabilizing osmolytes such as sucrose.

The purpose of the present study was to explore this potential using 38 singly spin-labeled mutants of myoglobin distributed throughout the sequence. Correlation of the EPR spectra with protein structure provides new evidence that the site-dependent variation in line shape. and hence motion of the spin label. is due largely to differences in mobility of the helical backbone in the ns time range. Fluctuations between conformational substates. typically in the μs–ms time range. are slow on the EPR time scale. and the spectra provide a snapshot of conformational equilibria frozen in time as revealed by multiple components in the spectra.

The most popular strategy. double electron–electron resonance (DEER). is carried out at cryogenic temperatures (50–80 K) to increase the short spin–spin relaxation time (T2) upon which the technique relies. A challenge is to measure long-range distances (20–60 Å) in proteins near physiological temperatures. Toward this goal we are investigating an alternative approach based on the distance-dependent enhancement of spin–lattice relaxation rate (T1–1) of a nitroxide spin label by a paramagnetic metal.

1069458,Mapping molecular flexibility of spin labeled proteins on the nanosecond and longer time scales via CW lineshape analysis and osmolyte-perturbation EPR,2012,Carlos Javier López,,,,,,Proteins in solution exhibit structural fluctuations on a wide range of characteristic time scales. from fast backbone motions in the picosecond to nanosecond range to slow conformational exchange in the microsecond to millisecond time domain.  These motions can play important roles in function. thus elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying function requires experimental techniques capable of measuring motions on these time scales. Site directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy (SDSL-EPR) has been established as an important tool in protein science for studying structure. identifying dynamically disordered sequences. and monitoring conformational switching triggered by chemical or physical signals in soluble and membrane-bound proteins. However. it remains to be investigated whether fast backbone motions contribute to the spectra of the spin label side chain R1 in well-ordered sequences of regular secondary structure. and how slow conformational exchange between substates can be detected at equilibrium; these are goals of this dissertation. The results from this work support a model wherein variations in the EPR spectral lineshape of R1-labeled proteins measures the amplitude of fast but constrained backbone fluctuations on the nanosecond time scale. and show that these motions are correlated with the local packing density. In addition. it is shown that osmolyte perturbation SDSL (OP-SDSL) can be used to identify conformational equilibria between substates that have characteristic lifetimes > 100 ns.

The novel 2019 SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell by binding of the viral surface spike glycoprotein (S-protein) to cellular angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The virus specific molecular interaction with the host cell represents a promising therapeutic target for identifying SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs. The repurposing of drugs can provide a rapid and potential cure towards exponentially expanding COVID-19. Thereto. high throughput virtual screening approach was used to investigate FDA approved LOPAC library drugs against both the S-RBD and ACE2 host cell receptor.

The CLPs share significant sequence and structural similarities with active chitinases. however. do not display chitinase activity. Some of these proteins are reported to have specific functions and carbohydrate binding property. In the present study. we report a novel chitinase like lectin (TCLL) from Tamarindus indica. The crystal structures of native TCLL and its complex with N-acetyl glucosamine were determined. Similar to the other CLPs of the GH18 members. TCLL lacks chitinase activity due to mutations of key active site residues. Comparison of TCLL with chitinases and other chitin binding CLPs shows that TCLL has substitution of some chitin binding site residues and more open binding cleft due to major differences in the loop region. Interestingly. the biochemical studies suggest that TCLL is an N-acetyl glucosamine specific chi-lectin. which is further confirmed by the complex structure of TCLL with N-acetyl glucosamine complex. TCLL has two distinct N-acetyl glucosamine binding sites S1 and S2 that contain similar polar residues. although interaction pattern with N-acetyl glucosamine varies extensively among them. Moreover. TCLL structure depicts that how plants utilize existing structural scaffolds ingenuously to attain new functions.

Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies provide structural insights into key interactions between capsid protein (CP) and trans-membrane glycoproteins E1 and E2.

This delocalized LMCT excited state decays to a second excited state with two CN-stretch absorption bands.

Strong coherent coupling occurs between certain types of excitons but is missing between other types of excitons because the distinctive nature of excitons results in different spatial overlap.

The samples grown by Sb incorporation and Sb pre-deposition methods display high room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) intensity at extended long wavelength. This result is explained by the surfactant effects of Sb during the growth of GaInAs/GaAs QW systems. An abnormal S-shaped temperature dependence of the PL peak position is found in the In 0.42 Ga 0.58 As/GaAs triple QWs sample grown with Sb pre-deposition. By investigating the transmission electron microscope images and time-resolved PL spectra. it is found that the S-shaped temperature dependence of the PL peak position originates from the exciton localization effect brought by the Sb-rich clusters on the QW interface.,True,b72i4MEAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC,8,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0256-307X/22/8/073/meta,541198929800841480,/scholar?cites=541198929800841480,,http://cpl.iphy.ac.cn/EN/article/downloadArticleFile.do?attachType=PDF&id=35125,0,0,0

While a very long spin relaxation lifetime of a few nanoseconds at low temperature is observed under non-resonant excitation. it decreases dramatically under resonant excitation.

The measured radiative recombination lifetimes of different Te bound exciton states are quite different. varying from a few nanoseconds to tens of nanosecond.

It reaches maximum (∼40ns) for the Te4 bound states at x=0.155. The increase of the exciton lifetime is attributed to the increasing exciton localization effect caused by larger localization potential. In the large Te composition range (x>0.155). the exciton recombination lifetime decreases monotonically with Te composition.

Methodology/Principal Findings Its genome consists of four replicons (two chromosomes and two plasmids) containing a total of 6631 protein coding genes. Comparative analysis identified 1910 core genes common to the four genomes compared (C. necator JMP134. C. necator H16. C. metallidurans CH34. R. solanacearum GMI1000). Although secondary chromosomes found in the Cupriavidus. Ralstonia. and Burkholderia lineages are all derived from plasmids. analyses of the plasmid partition proteins located on those chromosomes indicate that different plasmids gave rise to the secondary chromosomes in each lineage.

This strain also shows additional metabolic capabilities towards alicyclic compounds and the potential for catabolism of almost all proteinogenic amino acids.

Improvement of plant salt-stress tolerance using Plant-Growth Promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has arisen as a promising strategy to help overcome this limitation. However. the molecular and biochemical mechanisms controlling PGPR/plant interactions under salt-stress remain unclear. The main objective of this study was to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying salt-stress tolerance enhancement in the salt-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants. when inoculated with the well-known PGPR strain Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN. To tackle this. different life history traits. together with the spatiotemporal accumulation patterns for key metabolites and salt-stress related transcripts. were analyzed in inoculated plants under short and long-term salt-stress. Inoculated plants displayed faster recovery and increased tolerance after sustained salt-stress. PsJN treatment accelerated the accumulation of proline and transcription of genes related to ABA signaling (RD29A and RD29B). ROS scavenging (APX2) and detoxification (GLYI7). and down-regulated the expression of LOX2 (related to JA biosynthesis). Among the general transcriptional effects of this bacterium. the expression pattern of important ion-homeostasis related genes was altered after short and long-term stress (AKT1. HKT1.

The ability to degrade specific aromatic components of root exudates could thus provide versatile catabolic bacteria with an advantage for rhizosphere colonization and growth. In this work. Cupriavidus pinatubonensis JMP134. a well-known aromatic compound degrader (including the herbicide 2.4-dichlorophenoxyacetate. 2.4-D). was shown to stably colonize Arabidopsis thaliana and Acacia caven plants both at the rhizoplane and endorhizosphere levels and to use root exudates as a sole carbon and energy source.

Catabolism of 3-CB is achieved via the expression of the chromosomally encoded benABCD genes and the tfd genes from plasmid pJP4. Since passive diffusion of benzoic acid derivatives at physiological pH is negligible. the uptake of this compound should be facilitated by a transport system. However. no transporter has so far been described to perform this function. and identification of chloroaromatic compound transporters has been limited. In this work. uptake experiments using 3-[ring-UL-14C]CB showed an inducible transport system in strain JMP134. whose expression is activated by 3-CB and benzoate.

Two of these. MALAT1 and Menβ. generate a tRNA-like small RNA in addition to the mature lncRNA. The stability of these tRNA-like small RNAs and bona fide tRNAs is monitored by the CCA-adding enzyme. Whereas CCA is added to stable tRNAs and tRNA-like transcripts. a second CCA repeat is added to certain unstable transcripts to initiate their degradation. Here. we characterize how these two scenarios are distinguished. Following the first CCA addition cycle. nucleotide binding to the active site triggers a clockwise screw motion. producing torque on the RNA.

However. DNA is not conventionally known to spontaneously enter into cells or to have any intrinsic biological activity. We hypothesized that cellular entry and acquisition of biological properties are functions of the size of DNA. To test this hypothesis. we generated small DNA fragments by sonicating high molecular weight DNA (HMW DNA) to mimic circulating cfDNA. Sonication of HMW DNA isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous human cells. bacteria and plant generated fragments 300–3000 bp in size which are similar to that reported for circulating cfDNA.

A chlorpromazine stimulatory effect upon iron uptake from 55Fe-citrate and 55Fe-transferrin by cortical synaptosome preparations of rats was recently demonstrated. The present work extends this study to other neuroleptic drugs such as thioridazine. haloperidol. clozapine and fluphenazine. Like chlorpromazine. thioridazine showed a stimulatory effect upon iron uptake from both iron donors whereas fluphenazine highly increased uptake from 55Fe-citrate but not from 55Fe-transferrin. Haloperidol and clozapine had no effect. Stimulation of iron uptake by neuroleptics is probably related to their property of calmodulin antagonism. since calmidazolium also stimulated synaptosomal iron uptake from both donors.

InTech,,61-72,,Nitric oxide has been found to play an important role as a signal molecule in many parts of the organism as well as a cytotocic effector molecule of nonspecific immune response. Nitric oxide is very important functions both in helminthes and mammalian hosts. Nitric oxide may react with proteins and nucleic acids. In addition to binding to heme groups. eg of guanylate cyclase. hemoglobin. and cytochrome C oxidase. NO may react with nucleophilic centers like sulfur. nitrogen. oxygen and aromatic carbons. The prime target for covalent binding of NO to a functional groups in proteins under physiological condition in the presence of oxygen are SH groups. The intra-mitochondrial reaction of NO with superoxide anion yields peroxynitrite. which irreversibly modifies susceptible targets within the mitochondria. inducing oxidative and/or nitrative stresses. The signal molecule of NO is synthesized by constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS). The killer molecule NO is synthesized by inducible NOS (iNOS). There is no signal or killer NO–it depends on the environments and partners involved–be very careful in that. Yes. the production is regulated in different ways. Inducible NOS is induced by numerous inflammatory stimuli. including endotoxin. cytokines and excretory/secretory products (ESP) of helminthes. ESP directly interact with the immune system and modulate host immunity. Nitric oxide is a highly reactive and unstable free radical gas that is produced by oxidation of L-arginine by oxygen and NADPH as electron donor to citrulline mediated by a family of homodimer named nitric oxide synthase.

Resveratrol. having robust anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. has a high potential to treat or prevent the pathogenesis of diseases. This study was conducted to reveal the relationship between diabetes-induced oxidative stress and tissue inflammation with changes in main enzymatic antioxidants (cat. sod. gpx. and gst) and the components of the insulin signaling pathway (insulin Rβ. irs-1. pi3k. akt. mtor) in kidney tissues. Additionally. the effects of resveratrol on these parameters were evaluated. Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups;(1) control/vehicle;(2) control/20 mg/kg resveratrol;(3) diabetic/vehicle;(4) diabetic/20 mg/kg resveratrol. Gene and protein expressions of antioxidant enzymes and insulin signaling elements were evaluated in renal tissues. Results: Downregulation of antioxidant enzymes’ gene expression in the kidney tissues of diabetic rats was demonstrated and this situation was devoted partially to the reduced gene expression of nfκb. Moreover. the components of renal insulin signaling elements were upregulated at both gene and protein expression levels in diabetic rats. and resveratrol treatment decreased this sensitization towards the control state. Conclusion: Resveratrol partially improved diabetes-induced renal oxidative stress and inflammation due to healing action on renal antioxidant enzymes and insulin signaling pathway components.

1070031,Antioxidants and regulation of antioxidant enzymes by cellular redox status,2010,Gökhan Sadi and Özlem Sadi,,,,,Yayıncı Yok,It has been well known that free radicals have numerous detrimental effects in both in vitro and in vivo in biological systems because of their unavoidable and tremendous reactivity against biological macromolecules especially proteins. carbohydrates and nucleic acids. They are produced in the biological systems continuously by various mechanisms and eliminated by cellular antioxidant systems. If not eliminated sufficiently. or there is a disturbance in their neutralization. inevitable cellular damage may occur. Activities or the presence of antioxidant enzymes in the cells are under strong regulation with transcriptional. translational and post translational mechanisms as a consequence of changes in cellular redox potential. Redox sensitive metabolic enzymes or proteins; such as protein phosphatases. NF-?B and AP-1. are capable of sensing the oxidant signals by reversible oxidation of their regulatory units which cause them to transduce the signal and adjust the cellular antioxidant metabolism. Redox sensitive proteins execute their functions via kinases. phosphatases. and transcription factors influencing the steady state levels of antioxidant enzymes. Therefore. cells may sense. transduce. and translate the oxidant signals into appropriate cellular responses depending on the cellular redox state.

Xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is a retrovirus that has been the subject of intense debate since its detection in samples from humans with prostate cancer (PC) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Controversy has arisen from the failure of some studies to detect XMRV in PC or CFS patients and from inconsistent detection of XMRV in healthy controls. Here we demonstrate that Taqman PCR primers previously described as XMRV-specific can amplify common murine endogenous viral sequences from mouse suggesting that mouse DNA can contaminate patient samples and confound specific XMRV detection. To consider the provenance of XMRV we sequenced XMRV from the cell line 22Rv1. which is infected with an MLV-X that is indistinguishable from patient derived XMRV. Bayesian phylogenies clearly show that XMRV sequences reportedly derived from unlinked patients form a monophyletic clade with interspersed 22Rv1 clones (posterior probability >0.99). The cell line-derived sequences are ancestral to the patient-derived sequences (posterior probability >0.99). Furthermore. pol sequences apparently amplified from PC patient material (VP29 and VP184) are recombinants of XMRV and Moloney MLV (MoMLV) a virus with an envelope that lacks tropism for human cells.

HIV also causes specific qualitative changes to the repertoire including an altered distribution of V gene usage. depletion of public TCR sequences and disruption of TCR networks. Short term anti-retroviral therapy has little impact on most of the global damage to repertoire structure. but is accompanied by rapid changes in the abundance of many individual TCR sequences. decreases in abundance of the most common sequences. and decreases in the majority of HIV-associated CDR3 sequences. Thus high-throughput repertoire sequencing of small blood samples that are easy to take. store and process can shed light on various aspects of the T-cell immune compartment and stands to offer insights into patient stratification and immune reconstitution.,True,gnbtFO0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,50,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00644/full,6430059289901798243,/scholar?cites=6430059289901798243,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00644/full,0,0,0

Little is known about whether these outbreaks are associated with a single or multiple viral genotypes and whether new mutations rapidly accumulate during transmission. Here. we take advantage of a well-characterized population cohort in Guinea-Bissau and produce a unique set of 23 full-length genome sequences. collected over 7 months from eight households. Comparative sequence analysis reveals that four distinct genotypes cocirculated among the population. three of which were present during the first week of the outbreak. although no patients were coinfected. which indicates that exposure to infectious virus from multiple sources is common during VZV outbreaks.

XMRV (Xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus). in chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer. though whether as causative agent or opportunistic infection is unclear. It has also been suggested that the virus can be found circulating amongst the general population. The discovery has been controversial. with conflicting results from attempts to reproduce the original studies.   Methodology/Principal Findings We extracted peripheral blood DNA from a cohort of 540 HIV-1-positive patients (approximately 20% of whom have never been on anti-retroviral treatment) and determined the presence of XMRV and related viruses using TaqMan PCR. While we were able to amplify as few as 5 copies of positive control DNA. we did not find any positive samples in the patient cohort.   Conclusions/Significance In view of these negative findings in this highly susceptible group. we conclude that it is unlikely that XMRV or related viruses are circulating at a significant level. if at all. in HIV-1-positive patients in London or in the general population.,True,gnbtFO0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,29,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018096,10730205533100933380,/scholar?cites=10730205533100933380,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018096,0,0,0

1070072,Route of entry-dependent blocks to retroviral replication,2008,Eleanor Ruth Gray,,,,,,Restriction factors are endogenous cellular proteins that block retroviral replication at specific points in the life cycle. Those identified so far include Fvl. Trim5a and TrimCyp. Their characterisation has extended knowledge of retroviral and cellular functions. and has added a new branch to innate immunity. Retroviral susceptibility to Fvl and Trim5a is determined by its capsid. and is manifested in a pre- (Trim5a. TrimCyp) or post- (Fvl) reverse transcription block to replication. Other blocks to replication have been postulated. For example. a novel anti-viral factor. Lv2. is thought to block replication of several primary isolates of HIV-2 in some cell lines. Knowledge of the early steps of virus replication. between entry and nuclear import. is critical to understanding restriction. The intention of the studies described in this thesis was to determine whether alternative routes of virus trafficking might affect susceptibility to Fvl and Trim5a. as well as to the putative Lv2. A system of two receptors was used. Tva800 and Tva950 both permit entry via ASLV envelope protein. but take the virus into the cell by two different endocytic mechanisms. The pathways traversed after binding to Tva800 and Tva950 were investigated and shown not to reroute virions around restriction mediated by Fvl and Trim5a. When virus titration curves were analysed. a distinctive pattern emerged suggesting that entry via Tva800. but not Tva950. requires engagement of more than one receptor- envelope pair. The block to replication caused by the putative factor Lv2 was also analysed.

In addition. we assessed the effects of zerumbone on cell proliferation activity of crypts by counting silver-stained nucleolar organizer regions protein (AgNORs) in colonic cryptal cell nuclei. To induce ACF rats were given three weekly subcutaneous injections of AOM (15 mg/kg body weight). They were also fed the experimental diet containing 0.01% or 0.05% zerumbone for 5 weeks. starting one week before the first dosing of AOM.

Pakistani population has a very rich anthrogeneological background with waves of migration from neighboring regions. Incidence rates of breast and ovarian cancer in Pakistan are on such a rapid rise that it is necessary to check the contributory factors. genetic and nongenetic. An insight into the prevalence data emphasizes the formulation of a BRCA1 and BRCA2 database for the Pakistani population. Method. In this study conducted by authors. data from diagnosed cases of both sporadic and inherited female breast and ovarian cancer cases was gathered after performing molecular genetic analysis by screening for alterations in the coding sequence of the BRCA gene. The region of interest was analyzed by the aid of various molecular biology tools such as automated DNA sequencer. Bioinformatics software was used to interpret the results. and database was prepared. Results. Mutational screening of the exons in all the samples of our study group did not reveal any pathogenic mutation. These results along with the results of the previous Pakistani studies for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were summed up to prepare a Pakistani database. Percentage involvement of these genes was estimated. Nine percent of these cancers show alterations in BRCA1 gene while 3 percent have shown BRCA2 variants. The remaining 88 percent of breast and ovarian cancers can be attributed to the involvement of other genes.,True,4v2i06MAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,30,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jo/2011/632870/abs/,5391118494203405806,/scholar?cites=5391118494203405806,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jo/2011/632870/abs/,0,0,0

Rawalpindi. and Centre forResearch in Experimental and Applied Medicine (CREAM). Army Medical College. Rawalpindi. Pakistanfrom June 2011-June 2012. We determined the levels of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR). Total LeukocyteCount (TLC). Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) in 72 patients withType 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and 40 healthy controls. The levels were correlated with age. durationof the disease. Body Mass Index (BMI). lipid profile and insulin resistance.Results: ESR. TLC. IL-6 and TNF-α were found to be significantly higher in T2DM patients. There wasalso statistically significant difference in BMI. fasting blood sugar. insulin resistance and dyslipidemia (except LDL) between diabetic and control group. All inflammatory markers except TNF-α were positivelycorrelated with insulin resistance. Only TNF-α was found to be correlated to duration of the disease. Both TLC and Serum insulin were positively correlated to BMI. Inflammatory markers were not correlatedto dyslipidemia.Conclusion: This is the first study reporting levels of cytokines in Pakistani diabetic patients and healthycontrols. There is augmented inflammation in T2DM in Pakistani patients which plays role in higher insulinresistance in these patients. TNF-α levels increases with longer duration of the disease.

1070223,Structural and functional insights of human 5-lipoxygenase,2011,Nathaniel Carson Gilbert,,,,,,This work describes the structure of human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)(Gilbert. Bartlett et al. 2011) and the techniques required to ascertain the structure. 5-LOX is a notoriously unstable enzyme with important biological functions. The human 5-LOX has been implicated in many disease states including asthma. atherosclerosis and cancer. Part of 5-LOX biology is the inherent instability of the enzyme. which is thought to help regulate the production of its pro-inflammatory products. the leukotrienes. Our objective was stabilizing the enzyme for in vitro studies without affecting catalytic fidelity. I was able to quantitate stabilizing and destabilizing point mutations of 5-LOX by thermal denaturation and kinetic analysis along with other biochemical techniques. Through rigorous site-directed mutagenesis experiments and multiple expression protocols. I was able to over-express an engineered form of 5-LOX that is soluble and stable for biochemical studies and most importantly amenable to crystallization. Our lab is the first to crystallize a human lipoxygenase and model the molecular details. Another objective was studying the effect of phosphorylation on specific serine residues in 5-LOX that have been previously shown to be phosphorylated in vivo. I focused on phosphorylation of Ser663. which is ten amino acids removed from the C-terminus that penetrates the 5-LOX body and binds to the catalytic iron. I mutated this Ser663 to an aspartate. which is a mutation that has been previously shown to mimic a phosphorylated serine. The mutant 5-LOX S663D has altered product specificity in that it oxygenates arachidonic acid (AA) on the 15 carbon preferentially …,True,32FTxtYAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,1,https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_dissertations/1747/,7709812654864269685,/scholar?cites=7709812654864269685,,https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2746&context=gradschool_dissertations,0,0,0

Acting at the nuclear membrane in leukocytes. 5‐LOX oxygenates its lipid substrate arachidonic acid to leukotriene A4. The structure of 5‐LOX was solved in a closed conformation with helix‐α2 shortened and two large hydrophobic residues from the helix corking the active site. Most other animal lipoxygenase structures were solved with an elongated helix‐α2 allowing for an open conformation of the active site. Our goal is to study the molecular determinants important for the transition from a closed to open structure. We used site‐directed mutagenesis of helix‐α2 residues to favor either a more opened or closed conformation. We also used inhibitors to probe the conformational flexibility of 5‐LOX by …,True,32FTxtYAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.01876,,,,,0,0,0

Most conventional therapies for the management of type II diabetes include oral hypoglycemic drugs. exercise. diet and physical intervention therapies such as Acupuncture. Insulin is used in the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Insulin and oral hypoglycemic drugs are expensive and have numerous side effects. Through ages different communities have used medicinal herbs for diabetes mellitus management. Today herbal remedies are gaining popularity because the efficacy of conventional medicine is on the wane. This study was designed to bioscreen aqueous leaf extracts of Caesalpinia volkensii for its hypoglycemic potential. Its in vivo toxicity was also evaluated. Ethnobotanical and pharmacological information on the plant was gathered from the local traditional herbal practitioner. The three tested dose levels (50. 100. and 150mg/kg body weight) lowered blood glucose levels appreciably. Phytochemical screening results show that the aqueous extract has phytochemicals associated with antidiabetic activity. The analysis of trace metal composition of the aqueous extracts showed that it contained Manganese. Iron. Copper. Zinc. Magnesium. Molybdenum. Chromium and Vanadium. all of which aid in lowering blood glucose levels. Preliminary in vivo histopathological analysis established that the extracts had no toxic effects on the organs and tissues.

Delile in albino mice,2016,VZ Safari and JK Kamau and PM Nthiga and MP Ngugi and G Orinda and EM Njagi,2,Pain Manage Med,113,2,,Acacia nilotica has been used to manage several diseases including pain. inflammation and fever. However. its efficacy has not been scientifically validated. The aim of this study therefore is to investigate the antinociceptive. antipyretic and anti-inflammatory activities of its aqueous extracts. The plant extract was collected from Loita division. Narok county in Kenya. A total of 96 albino mice with an average weight of 20 g was used for this study. Antinociceptive activity was determined by use of formalin− induced writhing test. A writhe was recorded by a stopwatch following the stretching of the abdomen and/or stretching of at least one hind limb. Anti-inflammatory activity was established by a formalin induced inflammation test. Hourly changes in paw sizes and reduction of edema around the paw was determined using a venier calipers. Antipyretic activity was carried out using Brewer’s yeast induced pyrexia. Temperature of each mouse was determined rectally by thermal probe thermometer. The aqueous leaf extracts of A. nilotica reduced pain. inflammation and fever mostly at dose 150 mg/kg body weight. Based on these findings it was concluded that the present study has demonstrated the antinociceptive. anti-inflammatory and antipyretic potential of aqueous leaf extracts of A. nilotica in albino mice and will serve as good bio-resource for generating readily available herbal formulations that are more effective in the treatment of pain. inflammation and fever conditions which are cheaper than the conventional synthetic drugs and have no side effects.,True,mIAOm6oAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C,22,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathew_Ngugi2/publication/299346569_Antipyretic_Antiinflammatory_and_Antinociceptive_Activities_of_Aqueous_Bark_Extract_of_Acacia_Nilotica_L_Delile_in_Albino_Mice/links/56f16c2a08aed354e56fb7dd.pdf,9198843476416112563,/scholar?cites=9198843476416112563,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathew_Ngugi2/publication/299346569_Antipyretic_Antiinflammatory_and_Antinociceptive_Activities_of_Aqueous_Bark_Extract_of_Acacia_Nilotica_L_Delile_in_Albino_Mice/links/56f16c2a08aed354e56fb7dd.pdf,0,0,0

This scaffolding activity requires the release of the autoinhibited conformation of LGN by binding of Gαi to its C-terminal GoLoco (GL) motifs. The interaction between the GL and TPR motifs of LGN represents a distinct GL/target binding mode with an unknown mechanism. Here. we show that two consecutive GL motifs of LGN form a minimal TPR-motif-binding unit. GL12 and GL34 bind to TPR0–3 and TPR4–7. respectively. The crystal structure of a truncated LGN reveals that GL34 forms a pair of parallel α helices and binds to the concave surface of TPR4–7. thereby preventing LGN from binding to other targets.

A number of individual genes involved in triacylglycerol metabolism have previously been reported to enhance the oil content of seeds when their expression is altered. However. it has yet to be established whether specific combinations of these genes can be used to achieve an additive effect and whether this leads to enhanced yield. Using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) as an experimental system. we show that seed-specific overexpression of WRINKLED1 (a transcriptional regulator of glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis) and DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (a triacylglycerol biosynthetic enzyme) combined with suppression of the triacylglycerol lipase SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 results in a higher percentage seed oil content and greater seed mass than manipulation of each gene individually.

Ascorbate oxidase is an apoplastic enzyme. which controls the redox state of the apoplastic ascorbate pool. RNA interference was used to decrease ascorbate oxidase activity in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Fruit yield was increased in these lines under three conditions where assimilate became limiting for wild‐type plants: when fruit trusses were left unpruned. when leaves were removed or when water supply was limited. Several alterations in the transgenic lines could contribute to the improved yield and favour transport of assimilate from leaves to fruits in the ascorbate oxidase lines.

In eukaryotes only one gluconeogenic route has been described from organic acid intermediates and this relies on the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK). Here we show that two routes exist in Arabidopsis. and that the second uses pyruvate. orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK). Gluconeogenesis is critical to fuel the transition from seed to seedling. Arabidopsis pck1 and ppdk mutants are compromised in seed-storage reserve mobilization and seedling establishment.

Reveals an Essential Role for Suberin in the Control of Seed Dormancy [OPEN],2017,Fabio Fedi and Carmel M O’Neill and Guillaume Menard and Martin Trick and Simone Dechirico and Françoise Corbineau,,,,,,The mother plant plays an important dynamic role in the control of dormancy of her progeny seed in response to environmental signals. In order to further understand the mechanisms by which this dormancy control takes place in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). we conducted a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants that fail to enter dormancy in response to variation in temperature during seed set. We show that. for the first of these mutants. designated awake1. the maternal allele is required for entry into strongly dormant states and that awake1 mutants show seed phenotypes shown previously to be associated with the loss of suberin in the seed. We identify awake1 as an allele of ABCG20. an ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene required for the transport of fatty acids during suberin deposition. and show that further suberin-deficient mutants have seed dormancy defects. Seed coat suberin composition is affected by temperature during seed maturation. but this response appears to be independent of ABCG20. We conclude that seed coat suberin is essential for seed dormancy imposition by low temperature and that the exclusion of oxygen and water from the seed by the suberin and tannin layers is important for dormancy imposition.Environmental signals during seed production are important determinants of seed properties. including seed dormancy and seed longevity. The mother plant plays an important role in this signaling process. collecting signals throughout her life history and modulating dormancy by providing hormones to maturing seeds and by plastic development of the tissues surrounding the embryo (Gutterman …,True,VOi6CpIAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabio_Fedi/publication/315063161_Awake1_an_ABC-Type_Transporter_Reveals_an_Essential_Role_for_Suberin_in_the_Control_of_Seed_Dormancy/links/590b39bcaca272f6580eb287/Awake1-an-ABC-Type-Transporter-Reveals-an-Essential-Role-for-Suberin-in-the-Control-of-Seed-Dormancy.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabio_Fedi/publication/315063161_Awake1_an_ABC-Type_Transporter_Reveals_an_Essential_Role_for_Suberin_in_the_Control_of_Seed_Dormancy/links/590b39bcaca272f6580eb287/Awake1-an-ABC-Type-Transporter-Reveals-an-Essential-Role-for-Suberin-in-the-Control-of-Seed-Dormancy.pdf,0,0,0

Yeast Lipid Conference,,,,The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome that comprises obesity. diabetes and  atherosclerosis is rapidly increasing in western populations. Fatty acid lipotoxicity due to  saturation of triglyceride biosynthesis in non-adipose depots. and cholesterol toxicity in  macrophages are underlying mechanisms to many of these disorders. We have generated  models of this phenomenon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by genetically either ablating  neutral lipid biosynthesis and exposing the cells to free fatty acids or blocking transport from  the ER. We demonstrate that loss of the acyltransferases responsible for triglyceride and  steryl ester synthesis renders the cells sensitive to unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate  and palmitoleate. Similarly. loss of the ER sterol transporter ARV1 induces numerous  responses to cell stress including the unfolded protein response.

The mechanism by which farnesol induces apoptosis is currently believed to be by direct competitive inhibition with diacylglycerol for cholinephosphotransferase. the final step in the phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathway. Our recent isolation of the first mammalian cholinephosphotransferase cDNA has enabled us to more precisely assess how farnesol affects phosphatidylcholine synthesis and the induction of apoptosis.

Reduced glutathione (GSH) plays an important role in maintaining cellular redox status by participating in thiol-disulfide exchange. which regulates a number of cell functions including gene expression and the activity of individual enzymes and enzyme systems. Maintaining optimum GSH/GSSG ratio is essential to cell viability. Decrease in the ratio can serve as an indicator of damage to the cell redox status and of changes in redox-dependent gene regulation. Disturbance of intracellular GSH balance is observed in a number of pathologies including cancer.

Role of development of adaptive antioxidant response to the rise of resistance to cytotoxical effect of doxorubicin (DOX) has been studied in human erythroleukemia K562 cells. Growth of resistance to DOX caused enhancement of antioxidant enzymes (Cu. Zn-SOD. Mn-SOD. catalase) elevation of Mn-SOD activity being predominant. Additional increasing of antioxidant level was elevation of GSH maintenance and level of GST-related enzymes (glutathione peroxidase. glutathione S-transferase. glutathione reductase) in resistance K562/DOX cells.

1070559,Why does iron abrogate the cytotoxic effect of S-nitrosothiols on human and animal cultured cells?,2007,VA Serezhenkov and EV Kalinina and VA Glazunova and AN Saprin and AF Vanin,52,Biofizika,5,869-875,,It was found that dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNIC) with thiol-containing ligands (cysteine or glutathione) of concentrations up to 1 mM produce no cytotoxic effect on cultured cells from human milk gland carcinoma (MCF-7). The cytotoxic action on MCF-7 cells was produced by S-nitrosocysteine: at a concentration of 1 mM. it induced the death of 50% cells. A more stable S-nitrosothiol. S-nitrosoglutathione. did not produce any cytotoxic effect at the same concentration. It is assumed that the negative action of nitrosocysteine is due to its rapid degradation. which results in the accumulation of large amounts of free NO molecules followed by their oxidation by superoxide ions to peroxynitrite. an efficient inhibitor of metabolic processes. These processes seem to be not characteristic of the more stable S-nitrosoglutathione. The cytotoxic effect of nitrosocysteine was completlly abrogated by the addition of 0.2 mM ferrous citrate complex to the medium. When S-nitrosoglutathione NO (0.5 mM) or S-nitrosoglutathione (0.5 mM)+ Fe (2+)-citrate (0.2 mM) were added to the medium. protein-bound dinitrosyl iron complexes formed with the involvement of endogenous or exogenous iron were detected in cells. The amount of the complexes in the presence of exogenous iron increased four times. reaching the value of 1.6 nmole/5 x 10 (6) cells. Therefore. it was proposed that the blockade of the cytotoxic action of S-nitrosoglutathione by iron complexes is due to Cys-NO transformation of S-nitrosocysteine into dinitrosyl iron complexes. The high stability of these complexes ensures only a gradual accumulation of nitric oxide in cells.,True,62YfiKMAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,7,https://europepmc.org/article/med/17969921,2951752563064328385,/scholar?cites=2951752563064328385,,,0,0,0

Stress conditions induce the overproduction of reactive oxygen species which can lead to cellular damage. In vitro assays have shown that enzyme inactivation by hydroxyl radicals (·OH) can be avoided in presence of Pro. suggesting that this amino acid could act as an ·OH scavenger. We applied Density Functional Theory coupled with a polarizable continuum model to elucidate how Pro reacts with ·OH. In this work we suggest that Pro reacts favourably with ·OH by H–abstraction on the amine group. This reaction produces the spontaneous decarboxylation of Pro leading to the formation of pyrrolidin-1-yl. In turn. pyrrolidin-1-yl can easily be converted to Δ1-pyrroline. the substrate of the enzyme Δ1-pyrroline dehydrogenase. which produces γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA and Pro are frequently accumulated in stressed plants and several protective roles have been assigned to these molecules.

1070589,The fermentation analogy: a point of view for understanding the intriguing role of proline accumulation in stressed plants,2016,Santiago Signorelli,7,Frontiers in Plant Science,,1339,Frontiers,The accumulation of proline under environmental stress is a conserved response of plants. Five decades have passed since the first report of proline accumulation in plants (Barnnet and Naylor. 1966). Many hypotheses have been put forward regarding assignment of a function to proline. These proposed roles include antioxidant capacity. osmoprotection. signaling. developmental function. and contributing in redox and cellular homeostasis (Smirnoff and Cumbes. 1989; Mattioli et al.. 2008; Szabados and Savouré. 2010; Kishor et al.. 2015). Among these. the osmotic adjustment. osmoprotectant. and antioxidant role have probably been the earliest and most widely accepted functions of proline. It is known that compatible osmolytes contribute in the retention of water. but also some of them force proteins to adopt a compactly folded structure. preventing the unfolding and reducing the exposed surface of the protein to damaging compounds (Attri et al.. 2010). In case of proline this was demonstrated both in vitro and in single cell organisms. For example. it was observed that proline overproducing E. coli mutants had greater osmotolerance (Csonka et al.. 1988) and also proline can inhibit protein aggregation in vivo (Ignatova and Gierasch. 2006). However. neither osmotic adjustment nor osmoprotection has been clearly confirmed in plants (Maggio et al.. 2002; Kavi Kishor and Sreenivasulu. 2014). This is probably more complex in plants because plants have different osmoregulatory mechanisms. Controversy is present regarding its proposed antioxidant role because recent evidence demonstrates that proline cannot scavenge singlet oxygen …,True,low6biAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,35,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01339/full,2859145463219081612,/scholar?cites=2859145463219081612,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01339/full,0,0,0

However. it is still controversial whether its protection is due to the direct scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To solve this issue and considering that nitrosative stress is directly related with an oxidative stress condition. we evaluated whether proline can protect against nitrosative damage.

It can oxidize proteins and lipids with important consequences on their biological functions. Despite its relevance. the interaction of NO2 with the cell barrier. the lipid membrane. is poorly understood. For instance. can lipid membranes limit NO2 diffusion? To estimate the permeability of lipid membranes to NO2 it is necessary to learn more about its solubility in the lipid phase. However. experimental data on NO2 solubility is very limited.

1070598,Autophagy in plants: Both a puppet and a puppet master of sugars,2019,Henry Christopher Janse van Rensburg and Wim Van den Ende and Santiago Signorelli,10,,,14,Frontiers,Autophagy is a major pathway that recycles cellular components in eukaryotic cells both under stressed and non-stressed conditions. Sugars participate both metabolically and as signalling molecules in development and response to various environmental and nutritional conditions. It is therefore essential to maintain metabolic homeostasis of sugars during non-stressed conditions in cells. not only to provide energy. but also to ensure effective signalling when exposed to stress. In both plants and animals. autophagy is activated by the energy sensor SnRK1/AMPK and inhibited by TOR kinase. SnRK1/AMPK and TOR kinases are both important regulators of cellular metabolism and are controlled to a large extent by the availability of sugars and sugar-phosphates in plants whereas in animals AMP/ATP indirectly translate sugar status. In plants. during nutrient and sugar deficiency. SnRK1 is activated. and TOR is inhibited to allow activation of autophagy which in turn recycles cellular components in an attempt to provide stress relief. Autophagy is thus indirectly regulated by the nutrient/sugar status of cells. but also regulates the level of nutrients/sugars by recycling cellular components. In both plants and animals sugars such as trehalose (Tre) induce autophagy and in animals this is independent of the TOR pathway. The glucose-activated G-protein signalling pathway has also been demonstrated to activate autophagy. although the exact mechanism is not completely clear. This mini-review will focus on the interplay between sugar signalling and autophagy.,True,low6biAAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,26,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.00014/full,3148945424025915122,/scholar?cites=3148945424025915122,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.00014/full,0,0,0

During quiescence. a homeostasis exists in phytohormone and source/sink regulation. which represses the metabolic and mitotic progression of the bud. Environmental change and shoot development can alter the homeostasis. leading to a binary state change and the commitment to growth. Within this context. light and oxygen availability can serve both metabolic and signaling functions. However. the question of substrate versus signal has proven challenging to resolve; in the case of sugars. there are disparities in the data from apical and axillary buds in juvenile shoots. while in postdormant perennial buds. light has only a facultative role in the decision. but signaling may still be essential for bud fate.

Nitric oxide (·NO) is a small free radical molecule having diverse signalling roles in plants. Here we present and discuss evidence showing the role of ·NO during different stages of the legume-rhizobia interaction such as recognition. infection. nodule development. and nodule senescence. Although the mechanisms by which ·NO modulates this interaction are not fully understood. we discuss potential mechanisms including its interaction with cytokinin. auxin and abscisic acid signalling pathways. In matures nodules. a more active metabolism of ·NO has been reported and both the plant and rhizobia participate in ·NO production and scavenging. Although ·NO has been shown to induce the expression of genes coding for NITROGENASE. controlling the levels of ·NO in mature nodules seems to be crucial as ·NO was shown to be a potent inhibitor of NITROGENASE activity. to induce nodule senescence. and reduce nitrogen assimilation. In this sense. LEGHEMOGLOBINS (Lbs) were shown to play an important role in the scavenging of ·NO and RNS. potentially more relevant in senescent nodules. Even though ·NO can reduce NITROGENASE activity. most reports have linked ·NO to positive effects on BNF. This can relate mainly to the regulation of the spatiotemporal distribution of ·NO which favours some effects over others.

Siena. Italy,Based on the different functions they perform. one might not expect at first that the type IV pilus (T4P) and type II secretion (T2S) systems are related. T4P are long. retractable polymers involved in adhesion. motility. biofilm formation and DNA uptake/transfer (Craig and Li. 2008). while the T2S system exports folded proteins or protein complexes from the periplasm using a short pseudopilus (McLaughlin et al.. 2012). Emerging structures of several components of the two systems has given credence to early predictions–based on sequence homology–that the T4P and T2S machineries are descended from a common ancestor (Hobbs and Mattick. 1993). Further support comes from studies showing that T2S pseudopili can be manipulated to form long adhesive pilus-like fibres (Sauvonnet et al.. 2000; Vignon et al.. 2003). and that some T4P systems can secrete proteins (Hager et al.. 2006; Han et al.. 2007). Although it is now clear that many T4P and T2S components–even those with poor sequence identity–are structurally related and may operate using similar mechanisms (Ayers et al.. 2010). intriguing differences in the number and arrangement of components hint at adaptations that may optimize them for their specific roles.Understanding of structure–function relationships in the T2S/T4P superfamily is further complicated by divergence of T4P into distinct classes. T4P are generally divided into type IVa (T4a) and type IVb (T4b) pili. with the T4bP containing a monophyletic subclass called the tight adherence (Tad) pili (Burrows. 2012).

1070663,Characterization of PilP from the Type IV Pilus System of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,2012,Stephanie Tammam,,,,,,Pathogenic bacteria employ a number of mechanisms to induce infection and survive in host tissues. including toxin secretion and the formation of protective multicellular structures called biofilms. Type IV Pili (T4P) are highly conserved organelles essential for both the establishment of infection and biofilm maturation. The goal of this research is to gain a molecular level understanding of the function of the highly dynamic T4P of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The pilMNOPQ operon encodes 5 members of a transmembrane complex that facilitates pilus function. While PilQ is the putative outer membrane secretin through which the pilus exits the cell. the roles of the PilM/N/O/P proteins are less well defined. Using both in vivo and in vitro techniques our characterization of PilP has provided significant insight into organization of the apparatus. PilP is an inner membrane lipoprotein essential for T4P function. but lipidation is dispensable. suggesting that its interactions with other T4P components are sufficient for PilP function.

Lys48-linked chains are the principal signal for proteasomal degradation. while Lys63-linked chains act as nonproteolytic signals. Despite significant progress in characterization of various cellular pathways involving ubiquitin. understanding of the structural details of polyubiquitin chain recognition by downstream cellular effectors is missing.

In carrying out its myriad functions. Ub conjugated to substrate proteins interacts with dozens of receptor proteins that link the Ub signal to various biological outcomes. Here we report mutations in conserved residues of Ub's hydrophobic core that have surprisingly potent and specific effects on molecular recognition. Mutant Ubs bind tightly to the Ub-associated domain of the receptor proteins Rad23 and hHR23A but fail to bind the Ub-interacting motif present in the receptors Rpn10 and S5a. Moreover. chains assembled on target substrates with mutant Ubs are unable to support substrate degradation by the proteasome in vitro or sustain viability of yeast cells.

Ubiquitination controls many critical cellular processes. most of which require specific lysines on ubiquitin (Ub). Of the 7 lysines (K) least is known about effects of modification of K6.  Methodology and Principal Findings We replaced K6 with tryptophan (W) because K6 is the most readily modified K and W is the most structurally similar residue to biotin. The backbone of K6W-Ub is indistinguishable from that of Wt-Ub. K6W-Ub is effectively conjugated and deconjugated but the conjugates are not degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome pathways (UPP). Expression of K6W-ubiquitin in the lens and lens cells results in accumulation of intracellular aggregates and also slows cell proliferation and the differentiation program. including expression of lens specific proteins. differentiation of epithelial cells into fibers. achieving proper fiber cell morphology. and removal of nuclei. The latter is critical for transparency. but the mechanism by which cell nuclei are removed has remained an age old enigma. This was also solved by expressing K6W-Ub. p27kip. a UPP substrate accumulates in lenses which express K6W-Ub.

1070714,Molecular Interactions of Ubiquitin and Polyubiquitin with Ubiquitin Binding Domains,2007,Aydin Haririnia,,,,,,Ubiquitin is a small protein that is covalently attached to proteins. either as a single ubiquitin moiety or as polyubiquitin chains.  A cascade of enzymatic reactions is required for the isopeptide linkage between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and a lysine residue on a substrate protein or another ubiquitin.  Attachment of ubiquitin or polyubiquitin. termed ubiquitination. mediates numerous cellular processes by acting as a versatile signal.  The signal transmitted by the tag depends on the nature of the modification. which defines the specificity of the tag for different cellular machinery.  This versatility is conferred by the variations in polyubiquitin tags. both in terms of length and lysine-linkage.  Polyubiquitin chains can adopt a variety of different conformations based on these variations.  The conformational and dynamic properties of the tag may optimize its binding to specific ubiquitin binding domains. therefore committing the target protein to distinct cellular outcomes.         A combination of NMR methods are used to study the interaction of several ubiquitin binding domains with Lys48- and Lys63-linked di-ubiquitin. the simplest model of a polyubiquitin chain. to gain insights into polyubiquitin recognition.  The di-ubiquitin binding interface with ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) and ubiquitin-associated domains (UBAs) are mapped.  Structural models of the complexes are also presented.

Current designs offer a hierarchy of folders containing documents and taskbar operations to launch/exit applications. We propose a Personal Role Management strategy that emphasizes management of the multiple roles users have in their professional and personal lives. Each role involves coordination with groups of people and accomplishment of tasks within a schedule. We define Personal Role Management and summarize our earlier work that led to this strategy. This current project focused on understanding how Personal Role Management might improve email for college students. College students often assume distinct and predictable roles. Their student role is structured by the rhythm and interactions of classes. projects and exams. In both their family role and their work role for local companies. they deal with separate groups of people. We describe scenarios of use of a role-based email system. an interface mockup and user reactions. This research suggests that using those roles as a driving component for designing an email interface might address problems identified in our surveys and interviews of college students.,True,Q-8b3gYAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.79.4998&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.79.4998&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

LRRK2 encodes a large multi-domain protein with GTPase and kinase activity. Initial data indicates that an intact functional GTPase domain is critically required for LRRK2 kinase activity. PD–associated mutations in LRRK2. including the most common G2019S variant. have variable effects on enzymatic activity but commonly alter neuronal process morphology. The mechanisms underlying the intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of LRRK2 GTPase and kinase activity. and the pathogenic effects of familial mutations. are incompletely understood. Here. we identify a novel functional interaction between LRRK2 and ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 1 (ArfGAP1). LRRK2 and ArfGAP1 interact in vitro in mammalian cells and in vivo in brain. and co-localize in the cytoplasm and at Golgi membranes. PD–associated and functional mutations that alter the GTPase activity of LRRK2 modulate the interaction with ArfGAP1. The GTP hydrolysis activity of LRRK2 is markedly enhanced by ArfGAP1 supporting a role for ArfGAP1 as a GTPase-activating protein for LRRK2. Unexpectedly. ArfGAP1 promotes the kinase activity of LRRK2 suggesting a potential role for GTP hydrolysis in kinase activation. Furthermore. LRRK2 robustly and directly phosphorylates ArfGAP1 in vitro. Silencing of ArfGAP1 expression in primary cortical neurons rescues the neurite shortening phenotype induced by G2019S LRRK2 overexpression. whereas the co-expression of ArfGAP1 and …,True,PPS0P9AAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,132,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002526,13478864353211156678,/scholar?cites=13478864353211156678,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002526,0,0,0

KRS mutations produce truncated forms of ATP13A2 with impaired protein stability resulting in a loss-of-function. Recently. homozygous and heterozygous missense mutations in ATP13A2 have been identified in subjects with early-onset parkinsonism. The mechanism(s) by which missense mutations potentially cause parkinsonism are not understood at present. Here. we demonstrate that homozygous F182L. G504R and G877R missense mutations commonly impair the protein stability of ATP13A2 leading to its enhanced degradation by the proteasome. ATP13A2 normally localizes to endosomal and lysosomal membranes in neurons and the F182L and G504R mutations disrupt this vesicular localization and promote the mislocalization of ATP13A2 to the endoplasmic reticulum. Heterozygous T12M. G533R and A746T mutations do not obviously alter protein stability or subcellular localization but instead impair the ATPase activity of microsomal ATP13A2 whereas homozygous missense mutations disrupt the microsomal localization of ATP13A2. The overexpression of ATP13A2 missense mutants in SH-SY5Y neural cells does not compromise cellular viability suggesting that these mutant proteins lack intrinsic toxicity.

LRRK2 encodes a multi-domain protein containing GTPase and kinase enzymatic domains. Disease-associated mutations in LRRK2 variably influence enzymatic activity with the common G2019S variant leading to enhanced kinase activity. Mutant LRRK2 induces neuronal toxicity through a kinase-dependent mechanism suggesting that kinase activity is important for mediating the pathogenic effects of LRRK2 mutations.

The intracellular imbalance of ions. disturbance in membrane dynamics. hypoxic conditions. and dysregulation of gene expression are all molecular pathogenic mechanisms closely associated with oxidative stress and underpin systemic changes in the body. These also include aspects such as chronic immune system activation. the impairment of cellular structure renewal. and alterations in the character of the endocrine secretion of diverse tissues.

1070756,Nitric oxide induced axon retraction is mediated through S-nitrosylation of microtubule-associated proteins.,,A Tranciková and H Stroissnigg and J Fuhrmann and A Meixner and F Nothias and F Propst,,,,,,Text Nitric oxide and S-nitrosylation of proteins at cysteine residues by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) are well established signaling mechanisms. In the nervous system. nitric oxide signaling is instrumental in long term potentiation and refinement of neuronal projections. On the other hand. nitric oxide has dramatic effects on growth cone morphology and growth cone collapse of neurons in culture. indicating that the cytoskeleton is involved in its actions. Despite the fact that tubulin and actin have been found to be S-nitrosylated. there is little to no knowledge about how nitric oxide signals to the cytoskeleton. Nitric oxide induced growth cone collapse and axon retraction involve reconfiguration (but not depolymerization) of axonal microtubules. but the underlying mechanism is unknown.We found evidence for an S-nitrosylation dependent signal transduction pathway involved in growth cone morphology and …,True,PPS0P9AAAAAJ:FsLZdJ3BAzkC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6050175076615114751&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
