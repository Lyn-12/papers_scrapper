1029893,Global signatures of protein and mRNA expression levels,2009,Raquel de Sousa Abreu and Luiz O Penalva and Edward M Marcotte and Christine Vogel,5,Molecular BioSystems,12,1512-1526,Royal Society of Chemistry,Cellular states are determined by differential expression of the cell’s proteins. The relationship between protein and mRNA expression levels informs about the combined outcomes of translation and protein degradation which are. in addition to transcription and mRNA stability. essential contributors to gene expression regulation. This review summarizes the state of knowledge about large-scale measurements of absolute protein and mRNA expression levels. and the degree of correlation between the two parameters. We summarize the information that can be derived from comparison of protein and mRNA expression levels and discuss how corresponding sequence characteristics suggest modes of regulation.,True,HWw7bF0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1006,https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2009/mb/b908315d,3044025718163318061,/scholar?cites=3044025718163318061,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4089977/,0,0,0

Using measurements of absolute protein and mRNA abundances in cellular lysate from the human Daoy medulloblastoma cell line. we quantitatively evaluate the impact of mRNA concentration and sequence features implicated in translation and protein degradation on protein expression.

Msi1 has been shown to affect their translation by binding to short elements located in the 3′-untranslated region. To better understand Msi1 functions. we initially performed an RIP-Chip analysis in HEK293T cells; this method consists of isolation of specific RNA-protein complexes followed by identification of the RNA component via microarrays.

In some populations. FAP onset seems to occur on average 2–11 years earlier in men than in women. and SSA appears to be a disease of elderly men. Most (95–100%) SSA patients described in the literature are men. suggesting that amyloid deposition in these patients may be sex hormone related. On the basis of gender-related differences in FAP onset. and on the almost exclusivity of SSA in elder men. we hypothesize that. sex hormones may increase TTR synthesis by the liver. and therefore. may contribute to amyloid deposition.

However. its mechanism of action has not yet been established comprehensively. To identify its target genes comprehensively and determine the main routes by which it influences glioblastoma phenotypes. we conducted individual-nucleotide resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) experiments. We confirmed that MSI1 has a preference for UAG sequences contained in a particular structural context. especially in 3′ untranslated regions.

Importantly. alterations in the cholinergic system are a key underlying factor in cognitive defects associated with aging. One essential component of cholinergic synaptic transmission is the vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT). which regulates the packaging of ACh into synaptic vesicles for extracellular release. Mutations that cause a reduction in either protein level or activity lead to diminished locomotion ability whereas complete loss of function of VAChT is lethal. While much is known about the function of VAChT. the direct role of altered ACh release and its association with either an impairment or an enhancement of cognitive function are still not fully understood.

It also binds retinol binding protein preventing its filtration trough the kidneys and therefore is involved in delivering retinol to target cells. Moreover. TTR sequesters amyloid-beta impairing its deposition in nervous tissues and possibly contributing to its removal. Despite its importance in mammalian physiology. there are few studies regarding the regulation of TTR synthesis. In silico analysis of the 5′ flanking region of the TTR gene allowed the identification of androgen responsive elements suggesting that androgens may regulate TTR expression in tissues where TTR and androgen receptor (AR) are co-expressed.

Recently. we discovered that short peptide nucleic acids (PNA) bind strongly and sequence selectively to a homopurine tract of double-helical RNA via formation of a triple helix. Herein. we tested if the molecular recognition of RNA could be enhanced by α-guanidine modification of PNA. Our study was motivated by the discovery of Ly and co-workers that the guanidine modification greatly enhances the cellular delivery of PNA. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that the guanidine-modified PNA (GPNA) had reduced affinity and sequence selectivity for triple-helical recognition of RNA. The data suggested that in contrast to unmodified PNA. which formed a 1:1 PNA–RNA triple helix.

However. the function of cortactin remains obscure. Here we show that cortactin co-localizes with the Arp2/3 complex. a de novo actin nucleator. at dynamic particulate structures enriched with actin filaments. Cortactin binds directly to the Arp2/3 complex and activates it to promote nucleation of actin filaments. The interaction of cortactin with the Arp2/3 complex occurs at an amino-terminal domain that is rich in acidic amino acids.

The magnitude of the particle formation events was observed to be greatest at the lowest tides with the highest concentrations of ultrafine particles growing to the largest sizes. probably by the condensation of anthropogenically-formed condensable material. At such sizes the particles should be able to act as cloud condensation nuclei at reasonable atmospheric supersaturations.,True,46OlYtQAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,97,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/10/2975/2010/,1871219794123362695,/scholar?cites=1871219794123362695,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/10/2975/2010/,0,0,0

However. knowledge on the assembly of rhizospheric communities in aged-contaminated industrial soils is still limited. especially with regard to transcriptionally active microbiomes and their link to the quality or quantity of carbon sources. We compared the short-term (2-10 days) dynamics of bacterial communities and potential PAH-degrading bacteria in bare or ryegrass-planted aged-contaminated soil spiked with phenanthrene. put in relation with dissolved organic carbon sources and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pollution. Both resident and active bacterial communities (analyzed from DNA and RNA. respectively) showed higher species richness and smaller dispersion between replicates in planted soils. Root development strongly favored the activity of Pseudomonadales within the first two days. and of members of Actinobacteria. Caulobacterales. Rhizobiales and Xanthomonadales within 6-10 days. Plants slowed down the dissipation of phenanthrene. while root exudation provided a cocktail of labile substrates that might preferentially fuel microbial growth. Although the abundance of PAH-degrading genes increased in planted soil. their transcription level stayed similar to bare soil.

Microbes play an essential role in the functioning of this ecosystem and are the main drivers of the biogeochemical cycling of elements. Yet. the diversity and abundance of microorganisms in this system remains poorly studied. in particular with regards to changes along environmental gradients. Here. we used amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA gene tags using primers covering both Bacteria and Archaea to assess the composition and diversity of the microbial communities from four sampling depths (surface. the maximum and minimum of the oxygen concentration. and near the seafloor) at ten oceanographic stations located in Bransfield Strait (northwest of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP)) and near the sea ice edge (north of the AP). Samples collected near the seafloor and at the oxygen minimum exhibited a higher diversity than those from the surface and oxygen maximum for both bacterial and archaeal communities. The main taxonomic groups identified below 100 m were Thaumarchaeota. Euryarchaeota and Proteobacteria (Gamma-. Delta-.

Various approaches used to evaluate O3 effects generally concur that current yield losses range from 5% to 15% among sensitive plants. There is. however. considerable genetic variability in plant responses to O3. To illustrate this. we show that ambient O3 concentrations in the eastern United States cause substantially different levels of damage to otherwise similar snap bean cultivars.

We hypothesized that cattle avoid leafy spurge because it contains 1 or more chemicals that elicit a conditioned flavor aversion when consumed. First. we tested cattle to determine if they reduced their intake of a novel feed on subsequent days if we modestly increased rumen fill by introducing additional feed or additional feed plus an aversive agent (lithium chloride. LiCl) after they had consumed the novel feed. We observed that cattle became averted (P = .0001) to the novel feed only when LiCl was administered with additional feed. Simply increasing rumen fill by a small amount did not cause cattle to reduce their intake of the novel feed the following day. Secondly. we tested cattle to determine if they reduced their intake of a novel feed on subsequent days if we introduced leafy spurge into their rumina following consumption of the novel feed. We also tested cattle to determine if a spurge-induced aversion to a novel feed was preventable by inoculation with rumen microbes from sheep with spurge in their diets. We found that introducing spurge into cattle after their intake of novel feed reduced (P < .01) their intake of the novel feed on subsequent days. Cattle inoculated with rumen microbes from spurge-adapted sheep had similar (P > .40) aversions to a novel feed paired with spurge introductions.

Here we organized discrete glucose oxidase (GOx)/horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme pairs on specific DNA origami tiles with controlled interenzyme spacing and position. The distance between enzymes was systematically varied from 10 to 65 nm. and the corresponding activities were evaluated. The study revealed two different distance-dependent kinetic processes associated with the assembled enzyme pairs. Strongly enhanced activity was observed for those assemblies in which the enzymes were closely spaced. while the activity dropped dramatically for enzymes as little as 20 nm apart. Increasing the spacing further resulted in a much weaker distance dependence.

Here we report a tweezer-like DNA nanodevice to actuate the activity of an enzyme/cofactor pair. A dehydrogenase and NAD+ cofactor are attached to different arms of the DNA tweezer structure and actuation of enzymatic function is achieved by switching the tweezers between open and closed states. The enzyme/cofactor pair is spatially separated in the open state with inhibited enzyme function. whereas in the closed state. enzyme is activated by the close proximity of the two molecules.

Existing protein immobilization approaches. including noncovalent or covalent attachments to solid supports. have difficulties in controlling protein orientation. reducing nonspecific absorption and preventing protein denaturation. New strategies for enzyme immobilization are needed that allow the precise control over orientation and position and thereby provide optimized activity.   Methodology/Principal Findings A method is presented for utilizing peptide ligands to immobilize enzymes on surfaces with improved enzyme activity and stability. The appropriate peptide ligands have been rapidly selected from high-density arrays and when desirable. the peptide sequences were further optimized by single-point variant screening to enhance both the affinity and activity of the bound enzyme. For proof of concept. the peptides that bound to β-galactosidase and optimized its activity were covalently attached to surfaces for the purpose of capturing target enzymes. Compared to conventional methods. enzymes immobilized on peptide-modified surfaces exhibited higher specific activity and stability. as well as controlled protein orientation.

Efficient coupling of substrate transport between enzymes is important for overall pathway activity and also controls the depletion of intermediate molecules that drive the reaction forward. Here. we assembled a three-enzyme pathway on a series of DNA nanoscaffolds to investigate the dependence of their activities on spatial arrangement. Unlike previous studies. the overall activity of the three-enzyme pathway relied less on inter-enzyme distance and more on the geometric patterns that arranged them within a relatively small range of 10–30 nm. Pathway intermediate detection demonstrated that the assembled enzyme systems quickly depleted the intermediate molecules through efficient reaction coupling.Biological systems have evolved complex. multistep. cascade pathways to make molecules and derive energy vital to the metabolism and reproduction of living systems.[1] Efficient coupling of substrates between enzymes increases the mass transport of molecules within the cascade reaction and modulates the ratio of reactants to products by depleting intermediates. making the reactions more thermally favoured. Such examples can be found in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. in which several individual reactions cannot happen spontaneously due to the positive standard ΔG (thermally disfavoured).[2] For instance. malate dehydrogenase (MDH). an essential component of the citric acid cycle pathway. catalyses the oxidation of malic acid to oxaloacetate (OAA) with the simultaneous reduction of NAD+ to NADH.[3] However.

It was also possible to recognize a structural rationale for the absence of other permutations. which either destabilize the invariant GTPase fold or disrupt regions that provide critical residues for GTP binding and hydrolysis. such as Switch-I and Switch-II.

Zoonotic transmission from livestock animals or animal-derived food is the likely cause for most of these infections. However. little is known about their general and host-specific mechanisms of colonization. or virulence and pathogenicity factors. In certain hosts. Campylobacter species colonize persistently and do not cause disease. while they cause acute intestinal disease in humans. Here. we investigate putative host-specificity using phenotypic characterization and genome-wide analysis of genetically closely related C. jejuni strains from different sources. A collection of 473 fresh Campylobacter isolates from Germany was assembled between 2006 and 2010 and characterized using MLST. A subset of closely related C. jejuni strains of the highly prevalent sequence type ST-21 was selected from different hosts and isolation sources. PCR typing of strain-variable genes provided evidence that some genes differed between these strains. Furthermore. phenotypic variation of these strains was tested using the following criteria: metabolic variation. protein expression patterns. and eukaryotic cell interaction. The results demonstrated remarkable phenotypic diversity within the ST-21 group. which however did not correlate with isolation source. Whole genome sequencing was performed for five ST-21 strains from chicken. human. bovine. and food sources. in order to gain insight into ST-21 genome diversity.

So far. functional and phenotypic differences between these two DC subsets remain unclear due to lack of markers to identify DDCs.  Methodology/Principal Findings In the present report. we demonstrated that macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin (MGL) 2 was exclusively expressed in the DDC subset in the skin-to-LN immune system. In the skin. MGL2 was expressed on the majority (about 88%) of MHCII+CD11c+ cells in the dermis. In the cutaneous LN. MGL2 expression was restricted to B220−CD8αloCD11b+CD11c+MHCIIhi tissue-derived DC. MGL2+DDC migrated from the dermis into the draining LNs within 24 h after skin sensitization with FITC. Distinct from LCs. MGL2+DDCs localized near the high endothelial venules in the outer T cell cortex. In FITC-induced contact hypersensitivity (CHS). adoptive transfer of FITC+MGL2+DDCs. but not FITC+MGL2−DCs into naive mice resulted in the induction of FITC-specific ear swelling. indicating that DDCs played a key role in initiation of immune responses in the skin.

1030023,Unique features of antiviral immune system of the vaginal mucosa,2012,Yosuke Kumamoto and Akiko Iwasaki,24,,4,411-416,Elsevier Current Trends,A vast majority of human vaccines rely on neutralizing antibodies for protection. With the exception of vaccines against human papillomavirus. despite a great amount of dedicated effort by the scientific community. development of vaccines against sexually transmitted viruses has generally been unsuccessful. Understanding the immunobiology of the genital tract is key to designing vaccines that prevent spreading of these viruses. Recent studies demonstrate that adaptive immunity in the vaginal mucosa is uniquely regulated compared to other mucosal organs. In particular. development of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is critically important for antiviral defense in vagina. In this review. we provide an overview of our current understanding of a wide spectrum of immune responses in vagina – from innate viral sensing to memory development.,True,W4BeUy0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,51,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791512000775,11759330536044197477,/scholar?cites=11759330536044197477,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3423557/,0,0,0

We conclude that innexins are the primordial gapjunction molecules. while connexins evolved more recently in the deuterostomes. The major question is whether the connexin–innexin dichotomy is an extreme case of sequence divergence from a common ancestor or a convergent solution to the problem of intercellular communication. A critical experiment was to identify gapjunction proteins in diploblastic organisms. eg cnidaria. These organisms have functional gap junctions [4] and represent an evolutionary grade before the deuterostome–protostome divergence.

JmjC domain containing proteins catalyze the oxidative removal of methyl groups on histone lysine residues. Here. we report studies to test the involvement of Jumonji domain-containing protein 6 (Jmjd6) in histone lysine demethylation. Jmjd6 has recently been shown to hydroxylate RNA splicing factors and is known to be essential for the differentiation of multiple tissues and cells during embryogenesis. However. there have been conflicting reports as to whether Jmjd6 is a histone-modifying enzyme.  Methodology/Principal Findings Immunolocalization studies reveal that Jmjd6 is distributed throughout the nucleoplasm outside of regions containing heterochromatic DNA. with occasional localization in nucleoli. During mitosis. Jmjd6 is excluded from the nucleus and reappears in the telophase of the cell cycle. Western blot analyses confirmed that Jmjd6 forms homo-multimers of different molecular weights in the nucleus and cytoplasm. A comparison of mono-. di-. and tri-methylation states of H3K4. H3K9. H3K27. H3K36. and H4K20 histone residues in wildtype and Jmjd6-knockout cells indicate that Jmjd6 is not involved in the demethylation of these histone lysine residues. This is further supported by overexpression of enzymatically active and inactive forms of Jmjd6 and subsequent analysis of histone methylation patterns by immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis. Finally. treatment of cells with RNase A and DNase I indicate that Jmjd6 may preferentially associate with RNA/RNA complexes and less likely with chromatin …,True,2dUprBcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,69,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013769,454695591567579406,/scholar?cites=454695591567579406,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013769,0,0,0

By itself. NusA induces transcription pausing and facilitates intrinsic termination. but NusA also is a cofactor of antiterminators that antagonize pausing and prevent termination. We show that NusA is required for λ-related phage 82 antiterminator Q82 to construct a stable complex in which RNA-based termination mechanisms have restricted access to the emerging transcript; this result suggests a locale for both Q82 and NusA near the β flap domain of RNA polymerase.

In order to evaluate the susceptibility level of plants to air pollutants. four parameters namely ascorbic acid. chlorophyll. relative water content and leaf extract pH were determined and computed together in a formulation signifying the air pollution tolerance index (APTI) of plants. APTI values of seven economically important plant species growing in the urban-industrial region of Allahabad were estimated. The order of tolerance is as follows: Artocarpus sp.< Eucalyptus sp.< Citrus lemon< Azadirachta indica< Rosa indica< Aegle marmelos< Mangifera indica. Among the plant studies. Mangifera indica (APTI value 18.51) is considered as a relatively tolerant species and Artocarpus sp.(APTI value 8.75) as most sensitive to air pollutants.

Initiation of repair involves the mismatch-.

A disulfide bridge is introduced into Photinus pyralis firefly luciferase to make two separate mutant enzymes with a single bridge. Even though the A103C/S121C mutant showed remarkable thermal stability. its specific activity decreased. whereas the A296C/A326C mutant showed tremendous thermal stability. relative pH insensitivity and 7.3-fold increase of specific activity. Moreover. the bioluminescence emission spectrum of A296C/A326C was resistant against higher temperatures (37 °C). Far-UV CD analysis showed slight secondary structure changes for both mutants.

CTCF‐binding sites are often flanked by thyroid hormone response elements (TREs). as at the chicken lysozyme upstream silencer.

Structural studies of Mimivirus have been difficult because of its size and long surface fibers.

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and atomic force microscopy were able to show that the 20 icosahedral faces of Mimivirus capsids have hexagonal arrays of depressions. Each depression is surrounded by six trimeric capsomers that are similar in structure to those in many other large. icosahedral double-stranded DNA viruses.

The extensive structural similarity revealed by such portals in diverse viruses. as well as their invariable positioning at a unique icosahedral vertex. led to the consensus that a particular. highly conserved vertex-portal architecture is essential for viral DNA translocations. Here we present an exception to this paradigm by demonstrating that genome delivery and packaging in the virus Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus occur through two distinct portals. By using high-resolution techniques. including electron tomography and cryo-scanning electron microscopy. we show that Mimivirus genome delivery entails a large-scale conformational change of the capsid. whereby five icosahedral faces open up. This opening. which occurs at a unique vertex of the capsid that we coined the “stargate”. allows for the formation of a massive membrane conduit through which the viral DNA is released. A transient aperture centered at an icosahedral face distal to the DNA delivery site acts as a non-vertex DNA packaging portal.

Here we present the crystal structure of a disk-shaped octameric form of VP40 formed by four antiparallel homodimers of the N-terminal domain. The octamer binds an RNA triribonucleotide containing the sequence 5′-U-G-A-3′ through its inner pore surface. and its oligomerization and RNA binding properties are facilitated by two conformational changes when compared to monomeric VP40. The selective RNA interaction stabilizes the ring structure and confers in vitro SDS resistance to octameric VP40. SDS-resistant octameric VP40 is also found in Ebola virus-infected cells. which suggests that VP40 has an additional function in the life cycle of the virus besides promoting virus assembly and budding off the plasma membrane.,True,mtLay3EAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,168,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212603000509,11071080652588359946,/scholar?cites=11071080652588359946,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212603000509,0,0,0

Ltd,Gephyrin is a bi‐functional modular protein involved in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis and in postsynaptic clustering of inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs). Here. we show that full‐length gephyrin is a trimer and that its proteolysis in vitro causes the spontaneous dimerization of its C‐terminal region (gephyrin‐E). which binds a GlyR β‐subunit‐derived peptide with high and low affinity. The crystal structure of the tetra‐domain gephyrin‐E in complex with the β‐peptide bound to domain IV indicates how membrane‐embedded GlyRs may interact with subsynaptic gephyrin. In vitro. trimeric full‐length gephyrin forms a network upon lowering the pH. and this process can be reversed to produce stable full‐length dimeric gephyrin. Our data suggest a mechanism by which induced conformational transitions of trimeric gephyrin may generate a reversible postsynaptic scaffold for GlyR recruitment. which allows for …,True,mtLay3EAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,156,https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600256,6453823674940155945,/scholar?cites=6453823674940155945,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600256,0,0,0

Here we show that full-length wild-type VP40 octamers bind RNA upon HEK 293 cell expression. While the Phe125-to-Ala mutation resulted in reduced RNA binding. the Arg134-to-Ala mutation completely abolished RNA binding and thus octamer formation. The absence of octamer formation. however. does not affect virus-like particle (VLP) formation. as the VLPs generated from the expression of wild-type VP40 and mutated VP40 in HEK 293 cells showed similar morphology and abundance and no significant difference in size.

Evidence is mounting successively regarding the adverse health effects of lead at low levels. This study was undertaken to assess the antioxidant status of lead-exposed residential and commercial painters of Lucknow city in Uttar Pradesh. India.Thirty-five painters aged 20 to 50 years who had blood lead levels ≤400 μg L-1 were selected for the study from a population of 56 male painters initially screened for blood lead. The control group included an equal number of subjects of the same age group without any occupational exposure to lead.We studied the association between low lead level exposure and antioxidant status and found that blood lead levels in painters were approximately seven times as high as in controls [(219.2 ± 61.9) μg L-1 vs. (30.6±10.1) μg L-1. respectively]. Among the biomarkers of lead toxicity a significant decrease in the level of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase [(9.13±4.62) UL-1 vs. (39.38±5.05) UL-1] and an increase in the level of zinc protoporphyrin [(187.9±49.8) μg L-1 vs. (26.4±5.5) μg L-1] were observed in painters compared to controls.

We show that lateral microtubule movement and looping is a result of microtubules sliding against one another in interphase Drosophila S2 cells. RNAi of the kinesin-1 heavy chain (KHC). but not dynein or the kinesin-1 light chain. eliminates these movements. KHC-dependent microtubule sliding powers the formation of cellular processes filled with parallel microtubule bundles. The growth of these cellular processes is independent of the actin cytoskeleton. We further observe cytoplasmic microtubule sliding in Xenopus and Ptk2 cells. and show that antibody inhibition of KHC in mammalian cells prevents sliding. We therefore propose that. in addition to its well established role in organelle transport. an important universal function of kinesin-1 is to mediate cytoplasmic microtubule–microtubule …,True,xA3zTykAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,98,https://www.pnas.org/content/107/27/12151.short,4201049485814330724,/scholar?cites=4201049485814330724,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/107/27/12151.full.pdf,0,0,0

Although durable responses can be achieved in some patients. many patients fail to respond to these therapies. underscoring the need for improvement with combination therapies. From a screen of 850 bioactive compounds. we identify HSP90 inhibitors as candidates for combination with immunotherapy. We show that inhibition of HSP90 with ganetespib enhances T-cell-mediated killing of patient-derived human melanoma cells by their autologous T cells in vitro and potentiates responses to anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 therapy in vivo. Mechanistic studies reveal that HSP90 inhibition results in upregulation of interferon response genes. which are essential for the enhanced killing of ganetespib treated melanoma cells by T cells.

Mercury (12 μmol/kg b.w.. single intraperitoneal injection) resulted in oxidative injury and metallothionein mRNA expression together with alterations in tissue histology and accumulation of mercury in the body organs. The ameliorating potential of vitamin E (24 μmol/kg b.w.. single intraperitoneal injection) was observed in mercury administered rats. Our findings indicate that vitamin E provides complete protection from mercury toxicity in the liver with both pre- and post-treatments. As mercury is nephrotoxic and neurotoxic. it is interesting to note that post-treatment of vitamin E showed more protection in the kidney compared to pre-treatment. In brain tissue. partial protection was observed on oxidative stress parameters. Our results thus suggest that post-treatment with vitamin E could be more beneficial …,True,h93IDOkAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,79,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1382668909001689,2089537521900955081,/scholar?cites=2089537521900955081,,,0,0,0

During the last years. research on diseases linked to Q-deficiency has highlighted the essential role of this lipid in cell physiology. Q levels are also affected during aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore. therapies based on dietary supplementation with Q must be considered in cases of Q deficiency such as in aging. However. the low bioavailability of dietary Q for muscle and brain obligates to design new mechanisms to increase the uptake of this compound in these tissues. In the present review we show a complete picture of the different functions of Q in cell physiology and their relationship to age and age-related diseases. Furthermore. we describe the problems associated with dietary Q uptake and the mechanisms currently used to increase its uptake or even its biosynthesis in cells.

Present study has been designed to investigate expression and activation of STAT3 in cervical precancer and cancer in relation to HPV infection during cervical carcinogenesis. Established cervical cancer cell lines and prospectively-collected cervical precancer and cancer tissues were analyzed for the HPV positivity and evaluated for STAT3 expression and its phosphorylation by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry whereas STAT3-specific DNA binding activity was examined by gel-shift assays. Analysis of 120 tissues from cervical precancer and cancer lesions or from normal cervix revealed differentially high levels of constitutively active STAT3 in cervical precancer and cancer lesions. whereas it was absent in normal controls.

Pharmacologic targeting of STAT3 expression in cervical cancer cell lines either by STAT3-specific siRNA or blocking its tyrosine phosphorylation by AG490 or curcumin led to dose-dependent accumulation of p53 and pRb in cervical cancer cells.

To examine additional virulence determinants. we performed a genetic screen in V.ácholerae-infected Drosophila and identified the two-component system CrbRS. CrbRS controls transcriptional activation of acetyl-CoA synthase-1 (ACS-1) and thus regulates the acetate switch. in which bacteria transition from excretion to assimilation of environmental acetate. The resultant loss of intestinal acetate leads to deactivation of host insulin signaling and lipid accumulation in enterocytes. resulting in host lethality. These metabolic effects are not observed upon infection with ΔcrbS or Δacs1 V. cholerae mutants.

Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism represent opposite clinical conditions. albeit not mirror images. Recent experimental and clinical studies have suggested the involvement of ROS tissue damage under altered thyroid status. Altered-thyroid state-linked changes in heart modify their susceptibility to oxidants and the extent of the oxidative damage they suffer following oxidative challenge. Chronic increase in the cellular levels of ROS can lead to a catastrophic cycle of DNA damage. mitochondrial dysfunction. further ROS generation and cellular injury.

A biphasic pattern was evident for lipid peroxidation and for the activity ratio of superoxide dismutase to catalase and glutathione peroxidase with increasing age. In the first phase of life (birth‐7 days). a linear fall in lipid peroxidation was accompanied by a gradual increase in the enzyme ratio which was reversed in the second phase (15–600 days). Glutathione and ascorbic acid levels increased from birth to the 45th day and remained unchanged up till 365 days and then reduced at 600 days of age. The maximum level of H2O2 observed at birth gradually decreased till 90 days and remained unchanged up till 365 days of age; thereafter its level was elevated on day 600.

Due to the rapid development in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) over the years. the major focus of proteomic studies has been around the ejaculated spermatozoa. Although seminal plasma is not a requirement for ART. the question arose whether the role of seminal plasma is merely to transport spermatozoa. Seminal plasma (SP) contains a large diversity of proteins that are essential not only for sperm transport. but also for sperm protection and maturation. Most of the proteins bind to sperm surface through exosomes (epididymosomes and prostasomes). modulating sperm function. interaction with the female reproductive tract and finally fertilization.

It is an independent biomarker of sperm function. Seminal plasma is a natural reservoir of antioxidants responsible for the nourishment. protection. capacitation. and motility of sperm within the female reproductive tract resulting in successful fertilization and implantation of the embryo. A comparative proteomic analysis of seminal plasma proteins from fertile men and infertile men with varying levels of ROS was carried out to identify signature proteins involved in ROS-mediated reproductive dysfunction. A total of 42 infertile men presenting with infertility and 17 proven fertile donors were enrolled in the study. ROS levels were measured in the seminal ejaculates by chemiluminescence assay. Infertile men were subdivided into Low ROS (0–<93 RLU/s/106 sperm; n = 11). Medium ROS (>93–500 RLU/s/106 sperm; n = 17) and High ROS (>500 RLU/s/106 sperm; n = 14) groups and compared with fertile men (4–50 RLU/s/106 sperm). 4 subjects from fertile group and 4 each from the Low.

The composition of milk of different mammals has been adapted during evolution of the species to fulfill the needs of the offspring. Milk not only provides nutrients. but it also serves as a medium for transfer of host defense components to the offspring. The host defense proteins in the milk of different mammalian species are expected to reveal signatures of evolution. The aim of this study is therefore to study the difference in the host defense proteome of human and bovine milk. We analyzed human and bovine milk using a shot-gun proteomics approach focusing on host defense-related proteins. In total. 268 proteins in human milk and 269 proteins in bovine milk were identified. Of these. 44 from human milk and 51 from bovine milk are related to the host defense system. Of these proteins. 33 were found in both species but with significantly different quantities. High concentrations of proteins involved in the mucosal immune system. immunoglobulin A. CD14. lactoferrin. and lysozyme. were present in human milk. The human newborn is known to be deficient for at least two of these proteins (immunoglobulin A and CD14). On the other hand. antimicrobial proteins (5 cathelicidins and lactoperoxidase) were abundant in bovine milk. The high concentration of lactoperoxidase is probably linked to the high amount of thiocyanate in the plant-based diet of cows. This first detailed analysis of host defense proteins in human and bovine milk is an important step in understanding the function of milk in the development of the immune system of these two mammals.,True,pS36wK0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,191,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019433,303429291434416523,/scholar?cites=303429291434416523,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019433,0,0,0

Therefore. there seems to be an opportunity for improvement by means of using more observations. The objective of this study was to verify whether the use of more data would add to the accuracy of predicting milk fat composition. In addition. the effect of season on modeling was quantified because large differences in milk fat composition between winter and summer samples exist. We concluded that the use of 3.622 observations does increase predictability of milk fat composition based on infrared spectroscopy.

Both the similarity in changes from day 0 to day 9 in the quantitative milk proteome. and the differences in specific protein abundance. were observed among four cows. One third of the quantified proteins showed a significant decrease in concentration over the first 9 days after calving. especially in the immune proteins (as much as 40 fold). Three relative high abundant enzymes (XDH. LPL. and RNASE1) and cell division and proliferation protein (CREG1) may be involved in the maturation of the gastro-intestinal tract. In addition. high correlations between proteins involved in complement and blood coagulation cascades illustrates the complex nature of biological interrelationships between milk proteins. The linear decrease of protease inhibitors and proteins involved in innate and adaptive immune system implies a protective role for protease inhibitor against degradation.

Changes in sleep duration or quality as seen in sleep disorders may prevent blood pressure to fall during sleep as expected in human physiology. This supports the increased prevalence of hypertension and drug-resistant hypertension in those with sleep loss. Other cardiovascular outcomes ie coronary lesions seem to be associated with sleep duration. Systemic inflammation. oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction seem to be associated with both sleep loss and sleep disorders. The most critical example is Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Sympathetic activation. oxidative stress and systemic inflammation are the main intermediary mechanisms associated with sleep apnea and intermittent hypoxia. There are now convincing data regarding the associations between hypertension. arrhythmias. stroke. coronary heart disease. increased cardiovascular mortality and OSA. There are also data in OSA and in animal models supporting the link between sleep apnea and atherosclerosis and dysmetabolism.

What moderate chronic hypoventilation adds to obesity on systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction remains unknown.  Question To compare inflammatory status and endothelial function in OHS versus eucapnic obese patients.  Methodology 14 OHS and 39 eucapnic obese patients matched for BMI and age were compared. Diurnal blood gazes. overnight polysomnography and endothelial function. measured by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT). were assessed. Inflammatory (Leptin. RANTES. MCP-1. IL-6. IL-8. TNFα. Resistin) and anti-inflammatory (adiponectin. IL-1Ra) cytokines were measured by multiplex beads immunoassays.  Principal Findings OHS exhibited a higher PaCO2. a lower forced vital capacity (FVC) and tended to have a lower PaO2 than eucapnic obese patients. HS-CRP. RANTES levels and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were significantly increased in OHS (respectively 11.1±10.9 vs. 5.7±5.5 mg.l−1 for HS-CRP. 55.9±55.3 vs 23.3±15.8 ng/ml for RANTES and 7.3±4.3 vs 6.1±1.7 for HbA1c). Serum adiponectin was reduced in OHS (7606±2977 vs 13660±7854 ng/ml). Endothelial function was significantly more impaired in OHS (RH-PAT index: 0.22±0.06 vs 0.51±0.11).  Conclusions Compared to eucapnic obesity. OHS is associated with a specific increase in the pro-atherosclerotic RANTES chemokine. a decrease in the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin and impaired endothelial function.
