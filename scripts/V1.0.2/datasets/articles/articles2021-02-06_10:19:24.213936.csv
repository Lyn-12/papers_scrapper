Thiseffective two-body force field is the successor to the Weiner et al. force field and was developed with some of the same philosophies. such as the use of a simple diagonal potential function and electrostatic potential fit atom centered charges. The need for a 10-12 function for representing hydrogenbonds is no longer necessary due to the improved performance of the new charge model and new van der Waals parameters. These new charges are determined using a 6-31G* basis set and restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting and have been shown to reproduce interaction energies. free energies of solvation. and conformational energies of simple small molecules to a good …,True,p0NWosUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,14191,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00124a002,10605761476136617312,/scholar?cites=10605761476136617312,,,0
63462,A well-behaved electrostatic potential based method using charge restraints for deriving atomic charges: the RESP model,1993,Christopher I Bayly and Piotr Cieplak and Wendy Cornell and Peter A Kollman,97,The Journal of Physical Chemistry,40,10269-10280,American Chemical Society,We present a new approach to generating electrostatic potential (ESP) derived charges for molecules. The major strength of electrostatic potential derived charges is that they optimally reproduce the intermolecular interaction properties of molecules with a simple two-body additive potential. provided. of course. that a suitably accurate level of quantum mechanical calculation is used to derive the ESP around the molecule. Previously. the major weaknesses of these charges have been that they were not easily transferable between common functional groups in related molecules. they have often been conformationally dependent. and the large charges that frequently occur can be problematic for simulating intramolecular interactions. Introducing restraints in the formof a penalty function into the fitting process considerably reduces the above problems. with only a minor decrease in the quality of the fit to thequantum …,True,p0NWosUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,5738,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100142a004,9089591642533658192,/scholar?cites=9089591642533658192,,,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Molecular mechanics models have been applied extensively to study the dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids. Here we report the development of a third-generation point-charge all-atom force field for proteins. Following the earlier approach of Cornell et al.. the charge set was obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potentials of dipeptides calculated using B3LYP/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. The main-chain torsion parameters were obtained by fitting to the energy profiles of Ace-Ala-Nme and Ace-Gly-Nme di-peptides calculated using MP2/ccpVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. All other parameters were taken from the existing AMBER data base. The major departure from previous force fields is that all quantum mechanical calculations were done in the condensed phase with continuum solvent models and an effective dielectric constant of 4.

Inc.,In this study. we present conformational energies for a molecular mechanical model (Parm99) developed for organic and biological molecules using the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) approach to derive the partial charges. This approach uses the simple “generic” force field model (Parm94). and attempts to add a minimal number of extra Fourier components to the torsional energies. but doing so only when there is a physical justification.

Encouragingly. the addition of a single V2 term involving the atoms C(sp3)-O-(sp3)-C(sp3)- N(sp2). which can be nicely rationalized because of the anomeric effect (lone pairs on oxygen are preferentially oriented relative to the electron withdrawing N). brings the sugar pucker phase of C2′-endo sugars to near perfect agreement with ab initio calculations (W near 162°). Secondly. the use of high level ab initio calculations on entire nucleosides (in contrast to smaller model systems necessitated in 1994–95 by computer limitations) lets one improve the % torsional potential for nucleic acids.

We used sequence similarity clustering to explore proteins with a comprehensive dataset consisting of sequences from available databases together with 6.12 million proteins predicted from an assembly of 7.7 million Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) sequences. The GOS dataset covers nearly all known prokaryotic protein families. A total of 3.995 medium- and large-sized clusters consisting of only GOS sequences are identified. out of which 1.700 have no detectable homology to known families. The GOS-only clusters contain a higher than expected proportion of sequences of viral origin. thus reflecting a poor sampling of viral diversity until now. Protein domain distributions in the GOS dataset and current protein databases show distinct biases. Several protein domains that were previously categorized as kingdom specific are shown to have GOS examples in other kingdoms. About 6.000 sequences (ORFans) from the literature that heretofore lacked similarity to known proteins have matches in the GOS data. The GOS dataset is also used to improve remote homology detection. Overall. besides nearly doubling the number of current proteins. the predicted GOS proteins also add a great deal of diversity to known protein families and shed light on their evolution.

CA. 1995). we have found that the docking conformation observed in an X-ray structure of one peptide inhibitor bound to CatD (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Such an approach appears to be general and applicable to most systems where equilibrium constants and free energy differences of solvation between structural isomers are needed. The strength of this method is further demonstrated by showing that one can “close the thermodynamic cycle” by simulating transitions from one species toanother going in different directions. In the case of gas-phase tautomeric energy differences. one still has uncertainties of the order of 1-2 kcal/mol at the highest level of ab initio theory used by us (6-31G* geometry optimization with energies at the MP2/6-31G* level) applied to the 2-oxopyridine …,True,p0NWosUAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,189,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00255a010,5589922210406083727,/scholar?cites=5589922210406083727,,,0

63490,Matrix metalloproteinase proteolysis of the myelin basic protein isoforms is a source of immunogenic peptides in autoimmune multiple sclerosis,2009,Sergey A Shiryaev and Alexei Y Savinov and Piotr Cieplak and Boris I Ratnikov and Khatereh Motamedchaboki and Jeffrey W Smith and Alex Y Strongin,4,PloS one,3,e4952,Public Library of Science,Background Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a significant role in the fragmentation of myelin basic protein (MBP) and demyelination leading to autoimmune multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The classic MBP isoforms are predominantly expressed in the oligodendrocytes of the CNS. The splice variants of the single MBP gene (Golli-MBP BG21 and J37) are widely expressed in the neurons and also in the immune cells. The relative contribution of the individual MMPs to the MBP cleavage is not known.  Methodology/Principal Findings To elucidate which MMP plays the primary role in cleaving MBP. we determined the efficiency of MMP-2. MMP-8. MMP-9. MMP-10. MMP-12. MT1-MMP. MT2-MMP. MT3-MMP. MT4-MMP. MT5-MMP and MT6-MMP in the cleavage of the MBP. BG21 and J37 isoforms in the in vitro cleavage reactions followed by mass-spectroscopy analysis of the cleavage fragments. As a result. we identified the MMP cleavage sites and the sequence of the resulting fragments. We determined that MBP. BG21 and J37 are highly sensitive to redundant MMP proteolysis. MT6-MMP (initially called leukolysin). however. was superior over all of the other MMPs in cleaving the MBP isoforms. Using the mixed lymphocyte culture assay. we demonstrated that MT6-MMP proteolysis of the MBP isoforms readily generated. with a near quantitative yield. the immunogenic N-terminal 1–15 MBP peptide. This peptide selectively stimulated the proliferation of the PGPR7.5 T cell clone isolated from mice with EAE and specific for the 1–15 MBP fragment presented in the MHC H-2U context …,True,p0NWosUAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,110,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004952,15632458225519649466,/scholar?cites=15632458225519649466,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004952,0

In an attempt to obtain basis‐set saturated values of interaction energies the extended basis sets are augmented by bond functions which simulate the effects of high‐symmetry polarization functions. The absolute minimum occurs for the configuration involving the C–H‐O hydrogen‐bond in which O‐H points toward one of the faces of the CH4 tetrahedron. The equilibrium C–O separation is equal to 6.8 a0 which corresponds to the bond energy of 0.83 kcal/mol. Due to basis set unsaturation of the dispersion energy the bond energy may still be underestimated by about 0.05 kcal/mol.

It was recently found that compounds with very low affinities to water do not produce anesthesia regardless of their lipophilicity. This finding implies that clinical anesthesia might arise because of interactions at molecular sites near the interface of neuronal membranes with the aqueous environment and. therefore. might require increased concentrations of anesthetic molecules at membrane interfaces. As an initial test of this hypothesis. we calculated in molecular dynamics simulations the free energy profiles for the transfer of anesthetic 1.1.2-trifluoroethane and nonanesthetic perfluoroethane across water-membrane and water-hexane interfaces.

Ion solvation enthalpies are calculated in excellent absolute agreement with experiment. once corrections for nonbonded cutoffs are made. The relative free energy of hydration of Li+ and Na+ is calculated in only qualitative agreement with experiment. which is surprising given the quantitative free energies found in such calculations on ion–water clusters.

We provide evidence that the Wnt/PCP pathway converges with pericellular proteolysis in both normal development and cancer. Here. we demonstrate that membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). a key proinvasive proteinase. functions as a principal sheddase of PTK7. MT1-MMP directly cleaves the exposed PKP621↓LI sequence of the seventh Ig-like domain of the full-length membrane PTK7 and generates. as a result. an N-terminal. soluble PTK7 fragment (sPTK7). The enforced expression of membrane PTK7 in cancer cells leads to the actin cytoskeleton reorganization and the inhibition of cell invasion.

Determining all relevant protein substrates of caspases remains a challenging task. Over 1500 caspase substrates have been discovered in the human proteome according to published data and new substrates are discovered on a daily basis. To aid the discovery process we developed a caspase cleavage prediction method using the recently published curated MerCASBA database of experimentally determined caspase substrates and a Random Forest classification method. On both internal and external test sets. the ranking of predicted cleavage positions is superior to all previously developed prediction methods. The in silico predicted caspase cleavage positions in human proteins are available from a relational database: CaspDB. Our database provides information about potential cleavage sites in a verified set of all human proteins collected in Uniprot and their orthologs. allowing for tracing of cleavage motif conservation.

Susceptibility to MS is linked to viral and bacterial infections. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a significant role in the fragmentation of myelin basic protein (MBP) and demyelination. The splice variants of the single MBP gene are expressed in the oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system (classic MBP) and in the immune cells (Golli-MBPs). Our data suggest that persistent inflammation caused by environmental risk factors is a step to MS.

In this work. we document our effort to refine the van der Waals parameters for the Thole polarizable models. Following the philosophy of AMBER force field development. the van der Waals (vdW) parameters were tuned for the Thole model with linear screening function to reproduce both the ab initio interaction energies and the experimental densities of pure liquids. An in-house genetic algorithm was applied to maximize the fitness of “chromosomes” which is a function of the root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of interaction energy and liquid density.

Furin is a ubiquitous proprotein convertase that cleaves after basic residues and transforms secretory proproteins into biologically active proteins. Despite this important role. many furin substrates remain unknown in the human proteome.   Methodology/Principal Findings We devised an approach for proteinase target identification that combines an in silico discovery pipeline with highly multiplexed proteinase activity assays. We performed in silico analysis of the human proteome and identified over 1.050 secretory proteins as potential furin substrates. We then used a multiplexed protease assay to validate these tentative targets. The assay was carried out on over 3.260 overlapping peptides designed to represent P7-P1’ and P4-P4’ positions of furin cleavage sites in the candidate proteins. The obtained results greatly increased our knowledge of the unique cleavage preferences of furin. revealed the importance of both short-range (P4-P1) and long-range (P7-P6) interactions in defining furin cleavage specificity. demonstrated that the R-X-R/K/X-R↓ motif alone is insufficient for predicting furin proteolysis of the substrate. and identified ∼490 potential protein substrates of furin in the human proteome.

HCV NS3/4A serine proteinase (NS3/4A) is a non-covalent heterodimer of the N-terminal. ∼180-residue portion of the 631-residue NS3 protein with the NS4A co-factor. NS3/4A cleaves the polyprotein sequence at four specific regions. NS3/4A is essential for viral replication and has been considered an attractive drug target.   Methodology/Principal Findings Using a novel multiplex cleavage assay and over 2.660 peptide sequences derived from the polyprotein and from introducing mutations into the known NS3/4A cleavage sites. we obtained the first detailed fingerprint of NS3/4A cleavage preferences. Our data identified structural requirements illuminating the importance of both the short-range (P1–P1′) and long-range (P6-P5) interactions in defining the NS3/4A substrate cleavage specificity. A newly observed feature of NS3/4A was a high frequency of either Asp or Glu at both P5 and P6 positions in a subset of the most efficient NS3/4A substrates. In turn. aberrations of this negatively charged sequence such as an insertion of a positively charged or hydrophobic residue between the negatively charged residues resulted in inefficient substrates. Because NS5B misincorporates bases at a high rate. HCV constantly mutates as it replicates. Our analysis revealed that mutations do not interfere with polyprotein processing in over 5.000 HCV isolates indicating a pivotal role of NS3/4A proteolysis in the virus life cycle.

Recently. phosphorylation of serine 124 in human thymidylate synthase (hTS) has been shown to lower the catalytic activity of the enzyme. To clarify a possible mechanism of the observed influence. molecular dynamics (MD). essential dynamics (ED) and MM-GBSA studies were undertaken. Structures derived from the MD trajectories reveal incorrect binding alignment between the pyrimidine ring of the substrate. dUMP. and the pterine ring of the cofactor analogue.

Many allosteric enzymes contain a central β-sheet in their catalytic domain. When an allosteric protein undergoes the transition between T (tense) and R (relaxed) allosteric states. this central β-sheet undergoes a conformational change. A traditional method of measuring this change. the root mean square deviation (RMSD). appears to be inadequate to describe such changes in meaningful quantitative manner. We designed a novel quantitative method to demonstrate this conformational transition by measuring the change in curvature of the central β-sheet when enzymes transition between allosteric states. The curvature was established by calculating the semiaxes of a 3-D hyperboloid fitted by least squares to the  atomic positions of the β-sheet.

Inc.,The coiled‐coil stability and rigidity may be of importance for molecular electronics (electronically bistable molecules). The coiled‐coil binding free energy has been calculated using molecular dynamics (MD). The energy has been computed as a difference of the appropriate free energies; derived for the coiled‐coil and isolated α‐helices separately. All MD simulations have been performed using an explicit model of the solvent. whereas the continuum solvent approach has been applied to analyze the MD trajectories. The computed stability of the coiled‐coil is of the order of −87 kcal/mol. i.e.. about −1.2 kcal/mol per amino acid residue. and arises mainly from the electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic effect.

63557,Role of N-glycosylation in activation of proMMP-9. A molecular dynamics simulations study,2018,Sonu Kumar and Piotr Cieplak,13,PloS one,1,e0191157,Public Library of Science,Human matrix metalloproteinase proMMP-9 is secreted as latent zymogen. which requires two-steps proteolytic activation. The secreted proMMP-9 is glycosylated at two positions: Asn38 and Asn120 located in the prodomain and catalytic domain. respectively. It has been demonstrated that glycosylation at Asn120 is required for secretion of the enzyme. while the role of Asn38 glycosylation is not well understood. but is usually linked to the activation process. One hypothesis stated that the Asn38 glycosylation might protect against proteolytic activation. However. the activation process occurs with or without the presence of this glycosylation. We conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the glycosylated and non-glycosylated proMMP-9 to elucidate the effect of Asn38 glycosylation on this two-step activation process. The simulation results suggest that Asn38 glycosylation does not hinder the activation process directly. but induces conformational changes in the vicinity of the first proteolytic region in such a way that E59-M60 cleavage is processed before R106-F107. These results correlate with analysis provided by Boon et al. and experimental data from Ogata et al. who attempted to determine the order of events in activation of proMMP-9. Results from additional MD simulations for the model of glycosylated proMMP-9 bound to galectin-8 N-domain suggest that Gal-8 by interacting with Asn38 glycan might further facilitate processing of the first cleavage between E59-M60. Thus. our simulation results suggest that both Asn38 glycosylation and interaction with Gal-8N may be involved in facilitating and the temporal order of the activation …,True,p0NWosUAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC,9,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191157,17511348324045497292,/scholar?cites=17511348324045497292,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191157,0

There is mounting evidence suggesting cross-talk between proteases and kinases. For instance: caspases. a class of proteases involved in programmed cell death—apoptosis. cleave a large set of various types of proteins. Simultaneously. kinases restrict caspase activity by phosphorylating their protein substrates in the vicinity of cleavage site. In addition. the caspase cleavage pattern in target proteins may be modified as a result of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding gene. This may either create a novel cleavage site. or increase/decrease the cleavage efficiency of a substrate. Such point mutations are often associated with the onset of disease.

The ensemble of its conformations under ambient conditions varies widely according to its electronic state.

Introduction In our previous investigations [1. 2] we used partition and spectro-photometric Near-IR methods to study hydration and homoassociation of benzoic acid in wet benzene solution. We observed the part of the water. which dissolves together with benzoic acid in benzene is not hydrogen-bonded. But molecules of that water interact with polar benzoic acid molecules by van der Waalsforces more strongly than with non-polar benzene molecules. On the other hand. the concentration of-bonded water in-creases along with increasing the benzoic acid monomers concentration. On the base of the results of these measurements. we postulated homoassociation and 1: 1 hydration of benzoic acid in wet benzene solution. Our observations are opposite to those reported in Refs.[3—7].

The presence of a short pathogenicity island in the genome is predominantly associated with the enterotoxigenic strains of B. fragilis. Metallopro-teinase II (MPII) and fragilysin (FRA) are the structurally related enzymes encoded by the pathogenicity island in the enterotoxigenic strains. Accordingly. there is a significant overlap between the cleavage preferences of MPII and FRA. These proteinases. however. are counter-transcribed in the bacterial genome suggesting their distinct and specialized functions in the course of infection. It is well established that FRA directly cleaves E-cadherin. a key protein of the cell-to-cell adhesion junctions in the intestinal epithelium. Counterintuitively. MPII directly binds to. rather than cleaves. E-cadherin. Structural modeling suggested that a potential E-cadherin …,True,p0NWosUAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC,2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425422/,15231138292903137663,/scholar?cites=15231138292903137663,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425422/,0

Determining all relevant protein substrates of caspases remains a challenging task. Over 1.500 caspase substrates have been discovered in the human proteome according to published data and new substrates are discovered on a daily basis. To aid the discovery process we developed a caspase cleavage prediction method using the recently published curated MerCASBA database of experimentally determined caspase substrates and a Random Forest classification method. On both internal and external test sets. the ranking of predicted cleavage positions is superior to all previously developed prediction methods.

Several hypothetical sets of atomic charges for methanol molecule have been constructed. yielding the same total molecular dipole moment of 2.14 D. Each of the sets has been perturbed into another one and the electrostatic contributions to the hydration free energy differences associated with such changes have been determined. The magnitude of calculated electronic contribution to the solvation free energies crucially depends on the position of the center charge and orientation of the total dipole moment within molecular van Waals envelope. It depends less on higher molecular multipole moments.

In this work. we extracted a wide variation of Ca2+ binding loop conformations from Ca2+ binding protein calmodulin (CaM) that adopt the most populated ternary structure types from the MD simulations. followed by ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) calculations on the 12 amino acids from entire loop that coordinate the Ca2+ in aqueous solution. Ca2+ charges are derived by fitting to the ESP in the context of classical or polarizable force field (PFF). We discover that the atom radius of Ca2+ in conventional force fields is too large for the QM calculation to capture the variation in coordination geometry of Ca2+ in its ionic form and lead to unphysical charges. Specially. we find that the fitted atomic charges of Ca2+ in the context of PFF depend on the coordinating geometry of electronegative atoms from the amino acids in the loop. Although the nearby water molecules do not influence the atomic charge of Ca2+. they are crucial for compensating the coordination of Ca2+ due to the conformational flexibility in the EF-hand loop.

As classical point-charge models continue to be used in routine biomolecular applications. there have been growing demands on developing polarizable force fields for handling more complicated biomolecular processes. Here. we focus on a recently proposed polarizable Gaussian Multipole (pGM) model for biomolecular simulations. A key benefit of pGM is its screening of all short-range electrostatic interactions in a physically consistent manner. which is critical for stable charge-fitting and is needed to reproduce molecular anisotropy. Another advantage of pGM is that each atom’s multipoles are represented by a single Gaussian function or its derivatives. allowing for more efficient electrostatics than other Gaussian-based models. In this study. we present an efficient formulation for the pGM model defined with …,True,p0NWosUAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC,0,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/5.0019560,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10517,0

FASN has garnered a resurgent interest as a therapeutic target. However. little effort has been made to better understand this target to improve upon previous drug discovery efforts. Using both computational modelling and enzymatic analysis. we have identified specific residues from the thioesterase (TE) domain of FASN that are crucial for the enzymatic function of FASN-TE while independent of the catalytic triad. Introduction of point mutations to these residues hinder the protein9s ability to cleave the proper substrate of FASN. effectively disrupting the de novo synthesis of fatty acids.

Enzymes responsible for neutral lipid synthesis have been identified but there is no evidence for enzymes that catalyze lipolysis of cholesterol esters and esterified lipids. Here we characterize several T. gondii serine hydrolases with esterase and thioesterase activities that were previously thought to be depalmitoylating enzymes. We find they do not cleave palmitoyl thiol esters but rather hydrolyze short chain lipid esters. Deletion of one of the hydrolases results in alterations in levels of multiple lipids species. We also identify small molecule inhibitors of these hydrolases and show that treatment of parasites results in phenotypic defects reminiscent of parasites exposed to excess cholesterol or oleic acid. Together. these data characterize enzymes necessary for processing lipids critical for infection and highlight the potential for targeting parasite hydrolases for therapeutic applications.,True,p0NWosUAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3741227,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/11/24/2020.11.24.396663.full.pdf,0

63591,Quantitative profiling of protease specificity.,2020,Boris I Ratnikov and Piotr Cieplak and Albert Remacle and Elise Nguyen and Jeffrey W Smith,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Proteases comprise an important class of enzymes. whose activity is central to many physiologic and pathologic processes. Detailed knowledge of protease specificity is key to understanding their function. Although many methodologies have been developed to profile specificities of proteases. few have the diversity and quantitative grasp necessary to fully define specificity of a protease. both in terms of substrate numbers and their catalytic efficiencies. We have developed a concept of “selectome”. which defines the set of substrates that uniquely represents specificity of a protease. We applied it to two closely related members of the Matrixin family – MMP-2 and MMP-9 by using substrate phage display coupled with Next Generation Sequencing and information theory-based data analysis. We have also derived a quantitative measure of substrate specificity. which accounts for both the numbers and relative catalytic efficiencies of substrates. Using these advances greatly facilitates uncovering selectivity between closely related members of protease families and provides insight into to the degree of contribution of catalytic cleft specificity to protein substrate recognition. thus providing basis to overcoming two of the major challenges in the field of proteolysis: 1) development of highly selective activity probes and inhibitors for studying proteases with overlapping specificities. and 2) distinguishing targeted proteolysis from bystander proteolytic events.,True,p0NWosUAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.179820v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/06/30/2020.06.30.179820.full.pdf,0

New emerging techniques that not only register the cleavage position but also measure catalytic efficiency of proteolysis are expected to improve the quality of predictions or at least substantially reduce the number of tested substrates required for confident predictions.

Their accurate modeling is crucial in the design and development of physical models in computational studies of biomolecules. It is known that widely used point-charge models cannot capture the subtle short-range interactions and molecular anisotropicity. Recently emerged point multipole models. in the meantime. face the so-called``polarization catastrophe''difficulty that requires artificial truncation and omission of important short-range interactions. Considering these limitations. we are developing a new polarizable Gaussian multipole (pGM) framework. which is capable of describing the short-range interactions more accurately without greatly increasing computational cost.

63609,9PL. UK,1995,Wendy D Cornell and Piotr Cieplak and Christopher I Bayly and Kenneth M Merz Jr and David M Ferguson and David C Spellmeyer and Peter A Kollman,,A Second Generation Force Field for the Simulation of Proteins and Nucleic Acids,,145,University of California. San Francisco,We present the derivation of a new molecular mechanical force field for simulating the structures. conformational energies. and interaction energies of proteins. nucleic acids. and many related organic molecules in condensed phases. This effective two-body force field is the successor to the Weiner et al. force field and was developed with some of the same philosophies. such as the use of a simple diagonal potential function and electrostatic potential fit atom centered charges. The need for a 10-12 function for representing hydrogen bonds is no longer necessary due to the improved performance of the new charge model. These new charges are determined using a 6-31G* basis set and restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting and have been shown to reproduce interaction energies. free energies of solvation. and conformational energies of simple small molecules to a good degree of accuracy. Furthermore. the new RESP charges exhibit less variability as a function of the molecular conformation used in the charge determination. The new van der Waals parameters have been derived from liquid simulations and include hydrogen parameters which take into account the effects of any geminal electronegative atoms. The bonded parameters developed by Weiner et al. were modified as necessary to reproduce experimental vibrational frequencies and structures. Most of the simple dihedral parameters have been retained from Weiner et al.. but a complex set of O and y parameters has been developed for the peptide backbone which do a good job of reproducing the energies of the low energy conformations of glycyl and alanyl dipeptides.,True,p0NWosUAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1216910092537149872&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

CIEPLAK*. M. GELLER* 1+. and A. LES* Introduction Experimental studies of the physicochemical properties of biologically active compounds in vivo are very complex. Most investigations are performed on model systems in various organic and inorganic solvents. Due to interactions between solvent and solute molecules. some properties of the nucleic bases are dependent upon the solvent. For example. in water solution stacking interactions are observed [1]. while in less polar solvents. eg chloro form or carbon tetrachloride. planar complexes are found [2. 3]. Changes of solvent can strongly influence the values of association or tautomerie constants [4-7].

The diagnosis is frequently delayed or missed because of the limited specificity of echocardiography and the traditional requirement for histological confirmation. It has long been recognized that technetium-labeled bone scintigraphy tracers can localize to myocardial amyloid deposits. and use of this imaging modality for the diagnosis of cardiac ATTR amyloidosis has lately been revisited. We conducted a multicenter study to ascertain the diagnostic value of bone scintigraphy in this disease.Results of bone scintigraphy and biochemical investigations were analyzed from 1217 patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis referred for evaluation in specialist centers.

Protein aggregates and amyloid fibrils cause functional and structural organ damage respectively. To date. at least 24 different proteins have been recognized as causative agents of amyloid diseases. localized or systemic. The two most common forms of systemic amyloidosis are light-chain (AL) amyloidosis and reactive AA amyloidosis due to chronic inflammatory diseases. β2-microglobulin amyloidosis is a common complication associated with long-term hemodialysis. Hereditary systemic amyloidoses are a group of autosomal dominant disorders caused by mutations in the genes of several plasma proteins.

The clinical observation that the anthracycline 49-iodo-49-deoxy-doxorubicin (IDOX) can induce amyloid resorption in patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis was the starting point for this investigation of its possible mechanism of action. IDOX binds strongly to all five types of natural amyloid fibrils tested: immunoglobulin light chains. amyloid A. transthyretin (methionine-30 variant). beta-protein (Alzheimer). and beta 2-microglobulin. Quantitative binding studies showed that IDOX. but not doxorubicin. binds strongly to amyloid fibrils. This binding is saturable and involves two apparently distinct binding sites with Kd values of 5.9 x 10(-11) M and 3.4 x 10(-9) M. IDOX inhibited in vitro insulin amyloid fibrillogenesis.

The amyloidogenic plasma cells derive from a transformed memory B cell that can be identified by anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies. Comparison of the primary structures of amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic light chains does not show any common structural motif in the amyloidogenic variants but reveals peculiar replacements which can destabilize the folding state. Reduced folding stability now appears to be a unifying property of amyloidogenic light chains. The tendency of these proteins to populate a partially unfolded intermediate state is a key event in the self-association that progresses to the formation of oligomers and fibrils. The mechanism of organ damage caused by AL amyloid deposition is not known. but clinical findings suggest that the process of amyloid fibril …,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,207,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847700942485,14285821039407222687,/scholar?cites=14285821039407222687,,,0

The most common of these is the acute phase response. which may be due to inflammation. malignancy. trauma. or many other disorders. Some studies have shown a decrease in hospital stay with nutritional therapy based on TTR concentrations. but many recent studies have shown that concentrations of albumin. transferrin. and transthyretin correlate with severity of the underlying disease rather than with anthropometric indicators of hypo-or malnutrition.There are few if any conditions in which the concentration of this protein by itself is more helpful in diagnosis. prognosis. or follow up than are other clinical findings. In the majority of cases. the serum concentration of C-reactive protein is adequate for detection and monitoring of acute phase responses and for prognosis. Although over diagnosis and treatment of presumed protein energy malnutrition is probably not detrimental to most patients. the failure to detect other causes of decreased concentrations (such as serious bacterial infections or malignancy) of the so-called visceral or hepatic proteins could possibly result in increased morbidity or even mortality.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,183,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Johnson13/publication/6428057_Clinical_indications_for_test_of_plasmatic_proteins_Transthyretin_prealbumin_in_inflammation_and_malnutrition/links/00463517e81d1cc5e1000000/Clinical-indications-for-test-of-plasmatic-proteins-Transthyretin-prealbumin-in-inflammation-and-malnutrition.pdf,12687929470433799959,/scholar?cites=12687929470433799959,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Johnson13/publication/6428057_Clinical_indications_for_test_of_plasmatic_proteins_Transthyretin_prealbumin_in_inflammation_and_malnutrition/links/00463517e81d1cc5e1000000/Clinical-indications-for-test-of-plasmatic-proteins-Transthyretin-prealbumin-in-inflammation-and-malnutrition.pdf,0

The disease is progressive and. accordingly. early diagnosis is vital to prevent irreversible organ damage. of which cardiac damage and renal damage predominate. The development of novel sensitive biomarkers and imaging technologies for the detection and quantification of organ involvement and damage is facilitating earlier diagnosis and improved evaluation of the efficacy of new and existing therapies.

Over the last decade. new treatment modalites have been developed for the management of this disorder. Our objective is to provide treatment recommendations for WM. A review of published reports was facilitated by a MEDLINE computer search and by a manual search of Index Medicus. Other sources included abstracts and conference proceedings. Most patients with WM who are diagnosed by chance without symptoms should not be treated. Initiation of treatment should not be based on level of serum monoclonal protein per se. The presence of cytopenia. significant adenopathy or organomegaly. symptomatic hyperviscosity. severe neuropathy or cryoglobulinemia indicates the need for treatment. The main choices for primary treatment of symptomatic patients with WM include alkylating agents. the nucleoside analogs fludarabine or cladribine and the monoclonal antibody rituximab or combinations of these programs. There are no data from prospective randomized studies to recommend the use of one program over another. Nevertheless. the need for rapid disease control may favor the use of nucleoside analogs. whereas the presence of significant cytopenia may favor rituximab. High dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation may induce responses even in patients with resistance to all three class of agents. It may be prudent to avoid nucleoside analogs in patients who are candidates for high dose therapy.

In addition. the criteria now recognize that delayed responses after treatment with nucleoside analogues and biologic agents and the time point for assessing response in patients with WM should be considered so as to not miss or miscategorize a response. The new criteria should therefore help in better delineating responses to therapy in patients with WM. particularly with the wide use of nucleoside analogues and biologically based agents for this disease.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,126,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1557919011704176,17631318051379796005,/scholar?cites=17631318051379796005,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48224338/clm.2006.n.01320160821-20435-dtxcwb.pdf,0

Organ damage results from the extracellular deposition of proteolytic fragments of the acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A (SAA) as amyloid fibrils.

Although frequent changes of CVC dressing might theoretically reduce the incidence of infections. they are also accompanied by significant skin toxicity and patient discomfort. No study has yet addressed these points. The objective of this study was to compare two different time interval protocols for CVC dressing in order to assess the effects on local infections and toxicity. DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multicenter study. 399 bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients with a tunneled CVC (Group A. 230 pts) or a non-tunneled one (Group B. 169 pts) were randomly allocated to receive CVC dressing changes every 5 or 10 days. if belonging to Group A. or 2 or 5 days. if in Group B. Transparent. impermeable polyurethane dressings were used for all patients. The rate of local infections at the site of CVC insertion was assessed by microbiological assays every 10 days. while the severity of skin toxicity was measured according to the ECOG scale. RESULTS: Sixty-five per cent of enrolled patients were finally evaluable. Patients (in both Groups) receiving CVC dressing changes at longer intervals did not show a significant increase in the rate of local infections. while those who received dressing every 2 days had a significant increase in local skin toxicity.

We have been able to characterize the process of conformational switching and fibrillogenesis in this fragment of apolipoprotein A-I purified directly from ex vivo amyloid material. The peptide exists in an unstructured form in aqueous solution at neutral pH. The acidification of the solution provokes a collapse into a more compact. intermediate state and the transient appearance of a helical conformation that rapidly converts to a stable. mainly β-structure in the fibrils. The transition from helical to sheet structure occurs concomitantly with peptide self-aggregation. and fibrils are detected after 72 h.

This process causes organ dysfunction and death. unless it is arrested by therapy. So far. 25 types of amyloidosis have been classified according to the protein forming the amyloid deposits. In AL amyloidosis. a usually small-sized bone marrow plasma cell clone produces toxic light chains that cause multiple organ damage and fibrillar deposits [1]. Only a minority of monoclonal light chains form amyloid fibrils. probably due to specific mutations that destabilize the protein favoring its misfolding and aggregation.

METHODS: After a comprehensive systematic review of 1.450 papers. an Expert Panel formulated and graded sixty recommendations according to the supporting evidence. Evidence gaps were filled with twenty-two consensus-based statements. High grade recommendations (grade A) are reported below. RESULTS: Treatment should be immediately initiated in MM patients with related organ damage: those patients aged below 65 years who do not have severe co-morbidities should receive autologous stem cell transplantation. while patients not candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation should receive oral melphalan and prednisone. Interferon-a should not be associated with conventional chemotherapy. but it can be offered with or without steroids as a maintenance therapy to patients who have reached a plateau phase.

The binding parameters of the interaction between collagen and β2‐m were determined by band shift electrophoresis and surface plasma resonance by using bovine collagen of type I and type II and various isoforms of β2‐m. Wild‐type β2‐m binds collagen type I with a Kd of 4.1 × 10−4 M and type II with 2.3 × 10−3 M. By the BIAcore system we monitored the binding properties of the conformers of the slow phase of folding of β2‐m.

The truncated fragment has a more flexible three‐dimensional structure and constitutes an excellent candidate for the analysis of a protein in the amyloidogenic conformation. The surface topology of synthetic fibrils obtained from intact β2‐m and truncated ΔN6β2‐m was investigated by the limited proteolysis/mass spectrometry approach that appeared particularly suited to gain insights into the structure of β2‐m within the fibrillar polymer. The distribution of prefential proteolytic sites observed in both fibrils revealed that the central region of the protein. which had been easily cleaved in the full‐length globular β2‐m. was fully protected in the fibrillar form.

This investigation was aimed at defining the prevalence of clotting abnormalities and their clinical manifestations in patients with AL. DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive patients with biopsy proven amyloidosis and documented monoclonal gammapathy were enrolled within one year. The following clotting tests were considered in the study: activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). prothrombin time (PT). thrombin time (TT). reptilase time (RT). Russell's viper venom time (RVTT). fibrinogen. factor X and alpha-2 antiplasmin. RESULTS: Hemorrhagic manifestations were mild to moderate in nine patients. but severe and untractable in one. The most frequent clotting anomaly was defective fibrinogen conversion to fibrin. as demonstrated by prolongation of both TT (85% of cases) and RT (90% of cases). Low levels of factor X activity were observed in about 1 out of 4 samples. while fibrinogen and alpha2 antiplasmin levels were distributed over a wide range of values.

In contrast to multiple myeloma. the amyloid clone is typically indolent and of small size. and marrow PC clonality is not always apparent. This is generally investigated by analyzing the light chain isotype ratio in bone marrow PC. We investigated whether the degree of PC infiltration (PC%) and clonality (PC isotype ratio) affected survival in 56 consecutive patients with primary amyloidosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: PC% was determined by morphologic examination. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to determine the PC light chain isotype ratio. Statistical analysis was carried out using Cox regression models. RESULTS: The degrees of PC clonality and infiltration were inversely correlated with survival (PC isotype ratio. p= 0.001; PC%. p= 0.008). The two variables were weakly correlated (p= 0.02; r= 0.3). Bone marrow PC isotype ratio demonstrated a powerful independent prognostic value at multivariate analysis when analyzed together with congestive heart failure (the major known negative prognostic factor) and PC%. k/l ratio cut-off values of 0.2 (l patients. p= 0.022) and 16 (k patients. p= 0.03) discriminated two groups with a similar number of patients and significantly different survivals. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: PC clonality and marrow infiltration are important parameters that influence prognosis. presumably because they reflect the amount of pathogenic light chain synthesis.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,49,https://www.haematologica.org/article/view/1318,1634289146825973492,/scholar?cites=1634289146825973492,,https://www.haematologica.org/article/download/1318/6136,0

Our aims were to evaluate circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) levels in patients with TRAPS. in comparison to controls without inflammatory diseases. and to correlate their levels with parameters of disease activity and/or disease severity. Expression levels of circulating miRNAs were measured by Agilent microarrays in 29 serum samples from 15 TRAPS patients carrying mutations known to be associated with high disease penetrance and from 8 controls without inflammatory diseases. Differentially expressed and clinically relevant miRNAs were detected using GeneSpring GX software. We identified a 6 miRNAs signature able to discriminate TRAPS from controls. Moreover. 4 miRNAs were differentially expressed between patients treated with the interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist. anakinra. and untreated patients. Of these. miR-92a-3p and miR-150-3p expression was found to be significantly reduced in untreated patients. while their expression levels were similar to controls in samples obtained during anakinra treatment. MiR-92b levels were inversely correlated with the number of fever attacks/year during the 1st year from the index attack of TRAPS. while miR-377-5p levels were positively correlated with serum amyloid A (SAA) circulating levels.

63850,Current concepts on the pathogenesis of systemic amyloidosis,1996,Vittorio Bellotti and Giampaolo Merlini,11,,supp9,53-62,Oxford University Press,Amyloidosis is a pathological condition in which protein is deposited extracellularly in the form of insoluble fibrils that lead to organ dysfunction and death. Many different types of proteins are known to form amyloid and cause a heterogeneous array of clinical conditions. The unifying aspect of these conditions is the common structural entity resulting from the assembly of a primarily β-structure protein into 5–10 nm wide non-branching insoluble fibrils displaying the characteristic green birefringence of bound Congo red dye when viewed under polarized light. Several factors contribute to amyloid assembly. Certain biophysical characteristics of the amyloidogenic precursor influence amyloidogenicity. Any mutation that sufficiently decreases protein stability favours the formation of a partially folded state under physiological conditions.

Experiments were performed in vitro using a rapid equilibrium dialysis technique free from in vitro alterations in free fatty acids (FFA). At a total drug concentration of approximately 420 mumol/L. the free VPA fraction was 10.2+/-2.9%(SD) in pregnant women and 4.8+/-1.0% in controls (p less than 0.001). Pregnancy was associated with a marked reduction in serum albumin levels but with only a slight. nonsignificant elevation in FFA. Free VPA fraction was negatively correlated with serum albumin levels. A positive correlation between free VPA fraction and FFA was observed in the pregnant group but not in the controls. The only sample collected during labour showed a striking elevation of both free VPA fraction and FFA. in spite of a normal albumin concentration. Scatchard's plots showed VPA bound to two classes of binding sites on the albumin molecule. The number of primary (n1) and secondary (n2) binding sites in pregnant women (n1= 2.0; n2= 10.7) was virtually identical to that observed in the controls (n1= 1.9; n2= 9.8). The association constants of the primary (k1) and secondary (k2) sites were lower in pregnant women (15.9 X 10 (3) and 0.19 X 10 (3) L/mol. respectively. vs. 22.6 X 10 (3) and 0.33 X 10 (3) L/mol in controls) but the difference was not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS),True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:I858iXPj1OkC,39,https://europepmc.org/article/med/6424276,13061617332460078995,/scholar?cites=13061617332460078995,,,0

Routine electrophoretic analysis fails to detect a monoclonal component (MC) in a considerable portion of AL amyloidosis patients. We investigated whether the combination of immunofixation (IF) on agarose gel electrophoresis and bone marrow plasma cell (BMPC) light chain kappa/lambda ratio analysis could contribute to diagnosis in these cases. The possible use of the BMPC kappa/lambda ratio in monitoring the clone was also investigated. METHODS. We performed BMPC kappa/lambda ratio analysis and IF of serum and urine in 16 selected patients with no detectable MC at routine analysis. despite clinical features suggestive of primary amyloidosis. An anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody specific for the amyloidogenic immunoglobulin and the BMPC kappa/lambda ratio were used to monitor the clone in a patient who underwent autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. RESULTS. Abnormal kappa/lambda ratios were found in 14 (sensitivity 87.5%). and a MC in 12 (sensitivity 75%). Combination of the two analyses confirmed diagnosis in all cases. In one patient changes in the size of the clone. monitored on serial bone marrow aspirates by an anti-idiotypic antibody. paralleled variations of the kappa/lambda ratio. CONCLUSIONS. This study demonstrates that the combined use of IF and the BMPC kappa/lambda ratio is extremely powerful in AL amyloidosis. In addition. the BMPC kappa/lambda ratio should be considered for monitoring the amyloidogenic clone when serum or urine MC is not quantifiable.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,37,https://www.haematologica.org/article/view/706,7557672885171220818,/scholar?cites=7557672885171220818,,https://www.haematologica.org/article/view/706/4321,0

63863,Amyloidosis: 2008 BMT Tandem Meetings (February 13-17. San Diego),2008,Angela Dispenzieri and Giampaolo Merlini and Raymond L Comenzo,14,,1,6-11,Elsevier,Amyloidosis is a group of rare diseases in which a specific protein is deposited as aggregated interstitial fibrils that can compromise organ function and lead to death [1]. In the case of immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL). the specific protein is the light chain of the monoclonal gammopathy of a plasma cell dyscrasia. This is a rare disorder occurring at an incidence of 9 per million per year [2]. which is about 1/5 as common as multiple myeloma (MM). The mechanism by which AL amyloid fibrils are formed is not well understood. It is postulated that the immunoglobulins are secreted. most commonly with an excess of unchaparoned free light chains [3. 4]. These light chains are then somehow proteolyzed and/or processed into oligomers and finally nonbranching fibrils (8-10 nm) that are deposited in the microcirculation. In the case of renal involvement. it has been postulated that some of this process occurs in …,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC,34,https://www.bbmt.org/article/S1083-8791(07)00541-1/abstract,5922570439565880616,/scholar?cites=5922570439565880616,,https://www.bbmt.org/article/S1083-8791(07)00541-1/fulltext,0

Usually the offending molecules are the monoclonal light chains (LCs). but the complete immunoglobulins can participate in the pathogenesis of organ damage. The primary structure of the monoclonal proteins is at the basis of the ultrastructural organization of their aggregates which translates into characteristic kidney injuries. The kidney targeting is due to the concurrence of several factors such as the local catabolism of monoclonal LCs. specific interactions of the monoclonal proteins with tissue and cellular components. and local environmental conditions. Glomerulopathic LCs interact with mesangial cells producing. through two distinct pathways. LC amyloidosis or monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease.

Early objective identification of the risk of major complications or death is essential for appropriate management of individual patients and for the efficacy of treatment. However. clinical judgment alone is of low sensitivity in predicting severity and outcome in AP (1). and clinicobiochemical criteria such as those of Ranson (2) and Blamey et al.(3) suffer from a lack of simplicity and a 48-h delay in final assessment. Radiological methods enable a reliable diagnosis of necrotizing pancreatitis. but their availability often is limited (4).

Researchers postulated that glycosylation also has a pathogenic effect on LCs and glycosylated LCs could be more prone to be amyloidogenic [2]. Pathogenic glycosylation of proteins has been implicated in various hematological malignancies. often with prognostic implications [3]. However. in comparison with other diseases. glycosylation of LCs has been relatively underinvestigated in AL. This is largely due to the lack of a high-throughput procedure to facilitate rapid analysis of LC glycosylation.

Cham,Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL) is a rare. complex disease caused by misfolded free light chains produced by a usually small. indolent plasma cell clone. Effective treatments exist that can alter the natural history. provided that they are started before irreversible organ damage has occurred. The cornerstones of the management of AL amyloidosis are early diagnosis. accurate typing. appropriate risk-adapted therapy. tight follow-up. and effective supportive treatment. The suppression of the amyloidogenic light chains using the cardiac biomarkers as guide to choose chemotherapy is still the mainstay of therapy.

63913,Pathogenesis of renal failure in multiple myeloma: any role of contrast media?,2014,Michele Mussap and Giampaolo Merlini,2014,,,,Hindawi,The spectrum of kidney disease-associated monoclonal immunoglobulin and plasma cell malignancies is remarkably broad and encompasses nearly all nephropathologic entities. Multiple myeloma with kidney impairment at presentation is a medical emergency since the recovery of kidney function is associated with survival benefits. In most cases. kidney impairment may be the first clinical manifestation of malignant plasma cell dyscrasias like multiple myeloma and light chain amyloidosis. Multiple myeloma per se cannot be considered a main risk factor for developing acute kidney injury following intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media. The risk is increased by comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease. diabetes. hypercalcemia. dehydration. and use of nephrotoxic drugs. Before the administration of contrast media. the current recommended laboratory tests for assessing kidney function are serum creatinine measurement and the estimation of glomerular filtration rate by using the CKD-EPI equation. The assessment of Bence Jones proteinuria is unnecessary for evaluating the risk of kidney failure in patients with multiple myeloma. since this test cannot be considered a surrogate biomarker of kidney function.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:DIubQTN3OvUC,23,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/167125/abs/,5940975239779816317,/scholar?cites=5940975239779816317,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/167125/abs/,0

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were used as specific probes to identify and study amyloidogenic cells in two patients by means of immunofluorescence methods. These MoAbs recognized populations of bone marrow pre-PC. PC. and peripheral blood lymphocytes. To test whether the circulating Id+ lymphocytes were capable of PC differentiation. peripheral blood lymphocytes were incubated with the differentiation-inducing agents. interleukin-3 and interleukin-6 in liquid culture. Preincubation with the anti-Id MoAb and complement was used to inhibit formation of Id+ PC in vitro.

Occasionally free LC are per se cause of organ toxicity. as in free LC-related disorders. In AL amyloidosis. the most common of these conditions. free LC with peculiar biophysical properties related to their primary structure damage target organs and organize in amyloid fibrils. Unlimited availability of well-characterized free LC is instrumental to investigate the toxic effect of these proteins and to study their interactions with targets. We present a straightforward strategy to obtain recombinant monoclonal free LC by using a bacterial system. These proteins. expressed as inclusion bodies. were subjected to solubilization and refolding procedures to recover them in native form. To minimize differences from the circulating natural LC. full-length recombinant LC were expressed. i.e. complete of variable and constant regions. with the original amino acid sequence along the entire protein. and with no purification tags. The strategy was exploited to generate free LC from three AL amyloidosis patients. After purification. recombinant proteins were biochemically characterized and compared to the natural Bence Jones protein isolated from one of the patients. Results showed that the recombinant free LC were properly folded and formed homodimers in solution. similar to the natural Bence Jones protein used for comparison. Furthermore. as proof of pathogenicity. recombinant proteins formed amyloid fibrils in vitro.

This serious disorder is characterized by the presence of a clone of bone marrow plasma cells that produces monoclonal light chains (LCs) of the κ or predominantly λ type. These amyloidogenic LCs undergo extracellular misfolding and aggregation into proteotoxic soluble oligomers and amyloid fibrils that deposit within tissues. The lethal consequences of AL amyloidosis are due to the toxic products (the LCs) and not to the malignant behaviour of the plasma cell clone. Almost 80% of patients with AL amyloidosis have some degree of cardiac involvement. manifesting as heart failure (HF). and carrying a particularly poor prognosis.The past decade has seen major advances in the treatment of AL amyloidosis. and a rapidly fatal disease has become a treatable and possibly curable …,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:e-nnqdki048C,18,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527318312865,1456658076935526287,/scholar?cites=1456658076935526287,,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10073353/9/Fontana%20Revised%20manuscript%20%282%29.pdf,0

Several proteins are amyloidogenic in humans. resulting in different clinical presentations. either systemic or localized. Transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis (ATTR) is a late-onset. dominantly inherited systemic amyloidosis. Heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in the TTR gene confer a high amyloidogenic propensity to transthyretin (TTR). a plasma protein responsible for transporting thyroxine and vitamin A and mostly produced by the liver. Mutations in the TTR gene destabilize the native tetrameric structure of TTR. promoting the dissociation into misfolded monomers. which aggregate and finally form fibrils into target tissues.

It is characterized by the deposition of a misfolded light chain in target organs. This amyloid precursor is produced by a usually small but dangerous B-cell clone.Areas covered: This review examines the diagnostic workup of this disease and current knowledge of biomarker-based staging systems. In addition. a risk-adapted treatment approach is presented. as well as an overview of the new treatment strategies.Expert commentary: The cornerstone of treatment is rapid and effective chemotherapy targeting the underlying plasma cell clone.

La más común de ellas es la respuesta a la fase aguda. que puede deberse a inflamación. malignidad. trauma o muchos otros trastornos. Algunos estudios han demostrado que el tiempo de internación puede reducirse con una terapia nutricional basada en concentraciones de TTR. pero muchos otros estudios recientes han demostrado que las concentraciones de albúmina. transferrina y transtiretina se correlacionan con la severidad de la enfermedad subyacente y no con indicadores antropométricos de hipo o desnutrición. Hay pocas enfermedades. si es que existe alguna. en las que la concentración de esta proteína por sí misma es de más utilidad para el diagnóstico. el pronóstico o el seguimiento que otros hallazgos clínicos.

Although closely related to protein of the V κ II subgroup. light chain Inc differs from its counterpart by the replacement of some invariant residues in its variable domain. By comparing its sequence with that of the nonamyloid κ II Nim. a different distribution of some polar and apolar amino acid residues through the molecule is evidenced.

Although there is substantial overlap. the pattern of organ involvement is peculiar. with higher frequencies of lung. lymph nodes. and peripheral nervous system involvement. Early diagnosis is vital to start effective therapy before irreversible organ damage has occurred and should be based on markers of initial. asymptomatic organ dysfunction. such as natriuretic peptides for heart involvement and albuminuria for renal amyloidosis. Immunoglobulin M clones can give rise to both light chain (AL) and reactive (AA) amyloidosis. and once the diagnosis of amyloidosis is made. correct amyloid typing is necessary to design appropriate therapy and follow-up.

This document systematically analyses the indications for requesting a serum protein electrophoresis. Six possible items are evaluated: 1. Measurement of serum albumin concentrations: while electrophoresis identifies the albumin. its direct measurement is preferred. 2. Identification of α-1-antitrypsin deficiency: electrophoresis can exclude the deficiency. but an immunochemical measurement is needed for confirmation. thus electrophoresis being not indicated for this specific diagnostic problem. 3. Diagnosis/monitoring of inflammation: electrophoresis is able to identify some acute phase proteins. but its accuracy is insufficient for diagnosis and monitoring of this condition. 4 Diagnosis/monitoring of hypo/hypergammaglobulinemia: electrophoresis can be used for monitoring variations in IgG concentrations. but their direct quantitative measurement is preferable. 5. Identification of monoclonal components: electrophoresis is the technique of choice. 6.

Sporadic observations suggest a possible taste impairment in AL amyloidosis. but the frequency and intensity of this sensory anomaly are not known. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We submitted 21 AL amyloidotic patients. drawn from subjects referred to the Amyloidosis Study Center of the Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy. University of Pavia. to suprathreshold scaling analysis. RESULTS. Taste acuity was reduced in most of them. Every taste showed independent behavior. and 90% of these patients were hypogeusic. True ageusia for one or two tastes was observed in 35% of patients. No patient was aware of reduced taste acuity. Macroglossia did not seem to play a prominent role in dulling tastes. CONCLUSIONS. Impairment of taste perception suggests that gustative neuropathy is a frequently unnoticed expression of sensory involvement in AL amyloidosis.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC,12,https://www.haematologica.org/article/view/757,11553211712552143362,/scholar?cites=11553211712552143362,,https://www.haematologica.org/article/view/757/4474,0

They received intermittent melphalan or cyclophosphamide as maintenance therapy and peptichemio associated with vincristine at first relapse. The response rate (76%) was independent of clinical stage. evaluated according to Merlini et al and to Durie and Salmon. Among responsive patients. rapid responders (half-life of MC decrease less than 47 days for IgA and IgG and less than 29 days for light chain myelomas) had a bone marrow plasma cell labeling index significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than that of slow responders. Rapid responders had a median survival of 15 months. while slow responders had a median survival of 42 months (P less than 0.05). The difference in survival between the two groups was accounted for mainly by the difference in duration of first response and the different rates of MC increase following it. Both of these parameters were directly related to the half-life of MC decrease at response in IgA and IgG myelomas. The duration of second response and the half-life of MC increase following it were shorter than the duration of first response and than the half-life of MC increase at first relapse.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC,12,https://europepmc.org/article/med/4028038,16088366913766087491,/scholar?cites=16088366913766087491,,,0

The clinical picture is dominated by a progressive length-dependent polyneuropathy with onset in the feet with loss of temperature and pain sensations. accompanied by life-threatening autonomic dysfunction and infiltrative cardiomyopathy. as well as ocular disturbances. Variable expressivity. in terms of age of onset and involvement of extra-neurological sites. can be due to different mutations. but is also observed among individuals with the same mutation in different countries. Therefore diagnosis of TTR-FAP is often a challenge and must rely on careful clinical assessment combined with a multidisciplinary approach. Elimination of the synthesis of mutated TTR. through liver transplantation. may arrest the progressive neuropathy but not the cardiac and ocular involvement. Novel drugs have recently been developed based on a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the disease. Drugs that prevent the misfolding and deposition of mutated TTR have entered clinical trials. and one of these. tafamidis meglumine. has been approved in Europe and is now clinically available. Other medicines are now in the pipeline aimed at suppressing the expression of the mutated TTR gene or at promoting amyloid fibril destructuration. favouring resorption of amyloid deposits.

Since proteins are etiological agents of these diseases. proteomics was soon recognized as a privileged instrument for their investigation. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has acquired a fundamental role in management of systemic amyloidoses. being now considered a gold standard approach for amyloid typing. In parallel. approaches for analyzing circulating amyloid precursors have been developed. Moreover. differential and functional proteomics hold promise for identifying novel biomarkers and clarifying disease mechanisms.

The serum was lyophilised in the vials and afterwards closed with rubber stoppers and screw caps and stored at -70 °C. The stability and homogeneity of the material were assessed for 14 proteins. including CER and B2M. ERM-DA470k/IFCC was characterised for 12 proteins using the reference material ERM-DA470 as calibrant. This was achieved using a value transfer protocol that can be considered as reference procedure. The techniques used to measure the protein concentrations were immunonephelometry. immunoturbidimetry. and for ALB also visible spectrometry. The measurements were performed with different platform/reagent combinations (Abbott Architect. Beckman Immage. BN II and BN ProSpec. different Hitachi instruments. Roche Integra. LX 2200. and Olympus AU640). In total 18 laboratories participated in the value assignment. 4 using open value transfer procedures. 12 using closed value transfer procedures. and 2 using both open and closed procedures. The results show that open and closed value transfer procedures give very similar results. and lead to robust values for A2M. AAG. AAT. ALB. C3c. C4. HPT. IgA. IgG. IgM.

New hopes for a disease that cardiologists must know,2002,Eloisa Arbustini and Antonello Gavazzi and Giampaolo Merlini,3,,6,590-597,,Several proteins share the property of conforming as antiparallel beta-sheets. and forming insoluble amyloid fibrils that deposit in the interstitium of organs/tissues and cause systemic amyloidosis. Cardiac involvement is frequent and constitutes a major predictor of poor outcome. Its typical phenotype is that of restrictive cardiomyopathy. The biochemical classification of the amyloidogenic proteins provides the bases for innovative therapeutic approaches. Primary systemic amyloidosis (AL) is a protein conformation disorder in which monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains (kappa or lambda) produced by clonal plasma cells. are deposited as amyloid in kidneys. heart. liver. and other organs. The recent evidence that chemotherapy reduces or even eradicates the amyloidogenic clone with consequent functional improvement of the affected organs raises new hopes for a treatment. whose key of success is early diagnosis. Heart transplantation can be proposed in patients< 60 years of age in association with autologous stem cell transplantation. In serum amyloid A amyloidosis. fibrils are constituted of the acute phase serum amyloid A protein that is produced in excess in chronic inflammatory diseases such as familial mediterranean fever. autoimmune disorders and chronic infections. The strategy is to treat the underlying inflammatory disease. but new molecules inhibiting amyloid formation and promoting amyloid resorption are facing the clinical scenario and trials are in progress.

Despite availability of newer effective therapies. approximately 30% of patients with AL amyloidosis still die within 1 year from diagnosis due to advanced. irreversible cardiac involvement at presentation. In 40% of patients the diagnosis is made more than 1 year after the onset of symptoms. and. once amyloid organ involvement becomes symptomatic. organ dysfunction is often already advanced (Kourelis et al.

While there seems to be an overactivation of the neuronal interleukin-1 signaling pathway. the immune response is apparently compromised in FAP. Accordingly. little immune cell infiltration is observed around pre-fibrillar or fibrillar amyloid deposits. with the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon remaining poorly understood. Cathepsin E (CtsE) is an important intermediate for antigen presentation and chemotaxis. but its role in the pathogenesis of FAP disease remains unknown. In this study. we used both mouse primary macrophages and in vivo studies based on transgenic models of FAP and human samples to characterize CtsE expression in different physiological systems. We show that CtsE is critically decreased in bone marrow-derived macrophages from a FAP mouse model. possibly contributing for cell function impairment. Compromised levels of CtsE were also found in injured nerves of transgenic mice and. most importantly. in naïve peripheral nerves. sensory ganglia. murine stomach. and sural nerve biopsies derived from FAP patients. Expression of CtsE in tissues was associated with transthyretin (TTR) deposition and differentially regulated accordingly with the physiological system under study. Preventing deposition with a TTR small interfering RNA rescued CtsE in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In contrast. the expression of CtsE increased in splenic cells (mainly monocytes) or peritoneal macrophages. indicating a differential macrophage phenotype.

Cham,The amyloidoses encompass a heterogeneous group of diseases. wherein a misfolded protein accumulates extracellularly in the form of amyloid deposits. resulting in tissue damage and organ dysfunction.Intrinsic instability. increased concentration. proteolytic cleavage and/or mutations of a precursor protein favour its conversion into an aggregation-prone misfolded state. which ultimately results in the formation of amyloid fibrils through poorly identified prefibrillar oligomeric species. The latter are believed to be the main culprit for the toxicity.Numerous unrelated proteins can undergo this process. resulting in different types of the disease.

Indeed. indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on HEp-2 cell line is not always exhaustive in relation to the complexity of the antigens involved. Nine serum samples with anti-cytoplasmic antibodies (2 anti-Golgi apparatus. 3 with diffuse pattern and 4 with lysosome/endosome-like pattern) were tested with fluorescent confocal microscopy. Western blot analysis and. when necessary. with electron microscopy technique. Confirmation of the IIF staining pattern was performed in confocal microscopy by comparison with the respective antibody marker. The anti-endoplasmatic reticulum positivity was also confirmed by electron microscopy evaluation. Both anti-lysosome/endosome and anti-endoplasmatic reticulum positivity have been definitely identified by Western blot through clear reactivity with calreticulin and LC3B. respectively. These results do not aim at representing a standard routine laboratory procedure. Electron microscopy evaluation cannot be proposed as a routine approach. but confocal microscopy technique may be offered in centralized reference laboratories. Newer technologies. especially multiplex immunoassay. can also lead to an easier identification of these autoantibodies. without recurring to a home-made immunoblotting.

Familial occurrence of immunoglobulin-related (AL) amyloidosis has occasionally been reported. In this work we describe the concomitance of systemic amyloidosis and monoclonal gammopathy (one case of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and two cases without multiple myeloma or related diseases) in three Italian siblings. two males and one female. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. All of them showed a common pattern of polyneuropathy to different degrees; two presented a sicca syndrome and one also suffered from nephropathy. Two of them showed the same HLA typing with the same light chain type (k). but had different presenting symptoms. Polyneuropathy and a history of peptic disease in two cases was suggestive of type III familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) occurring in the setting of a familial monoclonal component. However. immunohistochemical studies on different tissue specimens using anti-apolipoprotein A1 and anti-transthyretin antibodies were negative. Further screening of DNA samples for transthyretin (TTR) gene mutations was also negative. Clinical and laboratory investigations ruled out reactive or senile amyloidosis and immunohistochemical studies with anti-light chain antibodies on amyloidotic tissue specimens were positive. As a consequence. this family represents a new case of familial AL-amyloidosis.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC,7,https://www.haematologica.org/article/view/756,16804399351978534700,/scholar?cites=16804399351978534700,,https://www.haematologica.org/article/download/756/4471,0

We report here the clinical. radiological. and biochemical features of a patient who incurred into this complication after 27 years of hemodialysis. Imaging of the amyloid deposition by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documents the amyloid infiltration in the muscles of the buttock region and highlights a peculiar feature of amyloid fibrils deposition in the subcutaneous fat. The amyloid deposition is confirmed by biochemical and microscopic analysis of fibrils extracted from a biopsy specimen.

Deposition of these proteins as soluble or insoluble cross β-sheets disrupts vital organ function. More than 20 different proteins have the propensity to form amyloid fibrils (1). The subunit protein composing amyloid fibrils defines the type and clinical character of distinct amyloidoses. Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is a lethal autosomal dominant disease with variable penetrance. Amyloid formation in FAP is mediated by misfolding of variant transthyretin. a transport protein primarily produced by the liver. Survival after disease onset is 5-15 years without intervention (2). Death is caused by complications of neuropathy. including malnutrition. infection. and cardiac arrhythmias (3).,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC,5,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=WQU5UOfM7YkC&oi=fnd&pg=PA387&dq=info:am7_8_un0msJ:scholar.google.com&ots=YVBO3gvfVD&sig=Ke8u50RtZrsSelzthrXDKMwvfek,7769457007739760234,/scholar?cites=7769457007739760234,,,0

Cardiac amyloid infiltration translates into progressive and often life-threatening cardiomyopathy. but disease severity. prognosis and treatment drastically differ according to the amyloidosis type. The notion that protein misfolding and aggregation play a more general role in human cardiomyopathies has further raised attention towards the definition of the proteotoxicity mechanisms.Areas covered: Mass spectrometry-based proteomics plays an important role as a diagnostic tool and for understanding the molecular bases of amyloid cardiomyopathies. The landscape of applications of proteomics to the study of cardiac amyloidoses and amyloid-related cardiotoxicity is summarized. with a critical synthesis of the major achievements.Expert commentary …,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:7XUxBq3GufIC,4,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14789450.2016.1242417,292363396969987390,/scholar?cites=292363396969987390,,,0

Here. to address this issue. we rationally engineered the amino acid sequence of the highly cardiotoxic LC H6 by introducing three residue mutations. designed to reduce the dynamics of its native state. The resulting mutant (mH6) is less toxic than its parent H6 to human cardiac fibroblasts and C. elegans. The high sequence and structural similarity. together with the different toxicity. make H6 and its non-toxic designed variant mH6 a test case to shed light on the molecular properties …,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:kVKjLOQJbwAC,3,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283619307156,8109969311466048101,/scholar?cites=8109969311466048101,,,0

The aim of treatment is the rapid and profound reduction. possibly the elimination. of the toxic LC. This is obtained by targeting the underlying plasma cell clone [1]. Response is graded based on the residual concentration of the amyloidogenic LC. It is generally accepted that the minimum goal of initial therapy should be very good partial response (VGPR)[2]. defined as a reduction of the difference between involved and uninvolved concentration of the free light chains (dFLC) below 40 mg/L.

In the last few years a major international effort allowed establishing baseline staging systems and response criteria in AL amyloidosis. However. we still lack validated progression criteria.

In the setting of immunosuppression BKV can reactivate and lead to BK virus nephropathy (BKVN) in renal transplant recipients. 1 BKVN is one of the main causes of allograft failure in renal transplant patients. Acute rejection and different viral infections should be considered in differential diagnosis of renal allograft dysfunction.

64156,Gene expression of pyrogenic cytokines in Hodgkin's disease lymph nodes.,1992,V Perfetti and TA Dragani and M Paulli and G Castelli and V Bellotti and PG Gobbi and G Merlini,77,Haematologica,3,221-225,,BACKGROUND: Inflammatory cytokines released by either the neoplastic or reactive cells in Hodgkin's disease (HD) might mediate its peculiar clinical and histopathological features. We investigated by Northern blotting the gene expressions of the pyrogenic and inflammation-associated cytokines IL-1 alpha. IL-1 beta. TNF-alpha. TNF-beta (lymphotoxin) and IL-6 in 14 HD lymph nodes and studied their relation to systemic symptoms (B symptoms). METHODS: Two ug of poly (A)+ RNA from 14 HD lymph nodes (8 from symptomatic and 6 from asymptomatic patients. of different histological type and disease stage) were subjected to agarose electrophoresis. Northern blotted and hybridized to the various cytokine cDNA probes. RESULTS: The inflammatory cytokines were expressed very heterogenously in HD. even in lymph nodes with the same histological type and with similar stromal inflammatory reactions. IL-1 beta was increased about 2 to 10 times in 5 of 8 lymph nodes from patients with B symptoms. whereas the other cytokines were heterogenously expressed in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Statistical analysis on densitometric values demonstrated that the difference in IL-1 beta expression between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was significant (p less than 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis of increased IL-1 levels in tumoral lymph nodes from symptomatic HD patients.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC,3,https://europepmc.org/article/med/1358770,44225155864724210,/scholar?cites=44225155864724210,,,0

64161,Treating Protein Misfolding Diseases: Therapeutic Successes Against Systemic Amyloidoses,2020,Alice Nevone and Giampaolo Merlini and Mario Nuvolone,11,,,1024,Frontiers,Misfolding and extracellular deposition of proteins is the hallmark of a heterogeneous group of conditions collectively termed protein misfolding and deposition diseases or amyloidoses. These include both localized(e.g.Alzheimer’s disease. prion diseases. type 2 diabetes mellitus) and systemic amyloidoses. Historically regarded as a group of maladies with limited. even inexistent. therapeutic options. some forms of systemic amyloidoses have recently witnessed a series of unparalleled therapeutic successes. positively impacting on their natural history and sometimes even on their incidence. In this review article we will revisit the most relevant of these accomplishments. Collectively. current evidence converges towards a crucial role of an early and conspicuous reduction or stabilization of the amyloid-forming protein in its native conformation. Such an approach can reduce disease incidence in at risk individuals. limit organ function deterioration. promote organ function recovery. improve quality of life and extend survival in diseased subjects. Therapeutic success achieved in these forms of systemic amyloidoses may guide the research on other protein misfolding and deposition diseases for which effective etiologic therapeutic options are still absent.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:hwlm9Y4obscC,2,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.01024/full,1023040686194995516,/scholar?cites=1023040686194995516,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.01024/full,0

Its role in upfront therapy is under evaluation in a phase III study. In this report we evaluated the safety and efficacy of 28-day cycles of daratumumab (single agent or combined with bortezomib or lenalidomide) in 72 previously treated patients with multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis. Fifty (69%) were refractory to the last line of therapy. After 8 infusions of daratumumab. 59 patients (82%) achieved a hematologic response. with 12 (16%) complete responses and 30 (42%) very good partial responses. After 16 infusions. the quality of response improved with 22 patients (30%) achieving complete response and 21 (29%) attaining very good partial response. Cardiac response was observed in 11 of 37 evaluable patients (29%) and renal response in 23 of 38 patients (60%). Daratumumab is highly effective in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis and high bone marrow plasma cell burden.

In immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis. clinical and experimental observations converge towards a direct toxic role of the amyloidogenic light chain (aLC) precursor [1. 2. 3]. However. the molecular underpinnings of AL amyloidosis remain obscure. partly due to the paucity of preclinical models for this disease. Generation of conventional transgenic mice with constitutive overexpression of human aLCs is technically hampered by the potential toxicity of these proteins. possibly resulting in embryolethality and selection against high expressor lines [4]. To overcome these limitations. we have employed the Cre/loxP system to generate a conditional transgenic mouse allowing regulated expression of an aLC.Materials and methods. The cDNA encoding a human aLC (λ). termed MAB. was subcloned in the pCAG-CAT-Oligo vector [5]. The resulting expression vector consisted of (5’→ 3’): a ubiquitous promoter (CAG). a reporter gene-stop cassette (CAT) flanked by two equally oriented loxP sites and the aLC (MAB). Transgenic mice obtained by pronuclear injection in C57BL/6J fertilized oocytes (termed CAG-CAT-MAB) were crossed with either mice expressing a constitutively active cre recombinase under the albumin promoter (Alb-cre)[6]. or with mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible cre recombinase under the CAG-promoter (CAGGS-cre TM)[7].

64183,Amyloidosis associated with Waldenström disease or IgM MGUS,2013,M Giampaolo Merlini,14,IWMF Torch,2,1-4,,Proteins are the engine of life in all living organisms. In order to function properly. proteins need to be assembled. or folded. in the right way. We now recognize almost 30 proteins that are. or may become.“misfolded” and “sticky” through aging or through mutations and form aggregates that are toxic for tissues. causing severe and progressive organ dysfunction. These aggregates of misfolded and sticky protein can then organize into very fine needles. called fibrils. which deposit and accumulate in organs and further impair organ function. These fibrillary deposits have a fatty-like appearance and are called amyloid. hence the term amyloidosis to indicate the diseases characterized by such deposits. For instance. one of these proteins. called beta-protein. which is produced in the brain. can aggregate and form plaques of amyloid deposits causing progressive loss of the brain cells (neurons) and of the cognitive functions as observed in Alzheimer’s disease.The amyloid associated with WM and IgM-MGUS is the result of misfolded proteins from the immune system produced in the following manner. Some of the cells involved in the body’s defense. namely the B-cells and the plasma cells. generate proteins referred to as antibodies or immunoglobulins that are constructed against everchanging targets. including bacteria. viruses. toxins. etc. To continuously adapt our defenses against such new threats. the structure of an immunoglobulin needs to be modified.

The measurement of serum TTR should be always associated with the measurement of serum C-reactive protein in order to detect acute phase response and assess the prognosis. The assays for TTR have a relatively high level of uncertainty (‘‘imprecision’’). Further investigation is required to define the complex relationship between TTR and inflammation. In the meantime. clinical evaluation–history and physical examination–should remain the mainstay of nutritional assessment.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC,2,http://www.sibioc.it/bc/2007/2/merlini.pdf,15175243196414413821,/scholar?cites=15175243196414413821,,http://www.sibioc.it/bc/2007/2/merlini.pdf,0

This antibody binds a conformational idiotope present on the monoclonal DEP IgA. but does not recognize the reduced and alkylated λ-chain monomers. nor the 15-to 17-kDa light chain fragments obtained from the amyloid fibrils. which have the same N-terminal sequence as the urinary light chains. The nonreactivity of this MAb with amyloid fibrils was confirmed by immunohistochemical examination of cryostatic sections of an amyloidoma surgically removed from the patient's subcutaneous tissue. Our data demonstrate that the deletion of about 70 amino acid residues of the C-terminus of the λ chain prevents the formation of the self-limiting dimer and may facilitate the deposition of fragments into amyloid fibrils.

Amelioration of preanalytical steps. implementation of novel mass spectrometry approaches. and development of tailored bioinformatics tools have progressively addressed the initial challenges encountered in the use of proteomics in characterizing amyloid; this progress has led to enhanced diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility. 2 The latest developments include the ability to detect and classify amyloid in a tissue sample by a single. validated …,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:EmjvLWWcsQIC,1,https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(18)30745-6/abstract,7450295636119026304,/scholar?cites=7450295636119026304,,https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(18)30745-6/fulltext,0

The second international workshop on WM attempted to refine the working definition of the disease within the context of a LPL (Owen et al. 2003a). Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) is a distinct clinicopathological entity resulting from the accumulation. predominantly in the bone marrow. of clonally related lymphocytes. lymphoplasmacytic cells. and plasma cells which secrete a monoclonal IgM protein. This condition is considered to correspond to the lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) as defined by the World Health Organization …,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:S2WlVNSe3u4C,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39590-1_16,12893822052126082911,/scholar?cites=12893822052126082911,,,0

However. although the kidney is involved in approximately 70% of patients with AL amyloidosis. the criteria for renal response have not been updated since 2005 and have never been validated. The UK Group showed that progression to dialysis is more likely with increasing CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) stage and less likely in patients who achieve a >90% dFLC decrease after chemotherapy. More recently. the Mayo Clinic group reported that a profound reduction (>95%) in proteinuria at 1 year is associated with longer patients’ survival. However. since renal involvement has less relevant impact on patients’ survival compared to cardiac involvement. the criteria of renal response and progression should predict progression to dialysis and not necessarily death.

However. a small clone can synthesize a very toxic protein. producing systemic damage and protean clinical presentations. The monoclonal protein can aggregate and deposit systemically as occurs in light-chain amyloidosis. monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease. and monoclonal cryoglobulinemia. The clone synthesizing noxious monoclonal proteins is often small and sensitive techniques may be required to detect these immunoglobulins.

Death occurs from deposition of amyloid in tissues and not progressive increase in the plasma cell tumor mass. Prior therapies for amyloidosis have been directed at interrupting the synthesis of the amyloid precursor protein. the immunoglobulin light chain. Previously no agents were available capable of dissolving amyloid deposits. IDOX produces responses by binding to and leading to the catabolism of amyloid deposits. This multicenter study attempted to develop a dosing schedule to confirm those initial results. METHODS: Protocol eligibility required an ejection fraction (EF) greater than 50%. ventricular septal thickness< 20 mm. a serum creatinine less than 2.5 mg/dL. a total bilirubin< 2.1 mg/dL. neutrophils of 1.500/nL and platelets of 100.000/uL.

These complexes are primarily electrostatic and are based on LZM's marked cationicity. They are reflected in the appearance of a variable fraction which is more anionic (Lya) than the major (Lyc) fraction. Lya/Lyc fractions have been found in every LZM isolate examined. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopic analyses of the composition of the carbohydrate present in Lya fractions both egg white and human LZM were quantitatively different but were consistent with the presence of chondroitins. The hypothesis is proposed that the chondroitins are"" shed"" from the labile glycocalyx of (all) cells as part of the process of"" cell shedding"" into the interstitial fluid which is continually supplied with LZM by resident macrophages. This would imply a potentially important role for LZM in modifying or modulating the manifold and diverse interactions of chondroitins and other glycosaminoglycans with biologically important macromolecules. eg. interleukins. growth factors. antigens.

The mouse immune response to casein has been extensively investigated: low levels of anti-casein antibodies have been detected in the serum of mice injected with casein. Such low immune response has been attributed to oral tolerization by the substantial amount of casein present in normal mouse chow diet. An experimental system equivalent to primary (AL) amyloid disease in man has not been demonstrated. and the possible role of dietary casein in this disease has not been thoroughly investigated.

The criteria were identified and validated to discriminate groups with different overall survival based on a rigorous process. Eight hundred and sixteen patients from seven referral centres. randomly divided in a testing and in a validation cohort. plus an additional validation cohort of 374 patients from a single centre were included in the study. The criteria for haematologic response were based on quantification of circulating free light chains (FLC) and immunofixation electrophoresis of serum and urine. The haematologic response categories in the order of deepening response–partial response. very good partial response. and complete response (CR)–were associated with increasingly longer survival [1].The ISA response criteria have been used as a …,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:lRzkMCTRmMwC,0,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13506129.2020.1868810,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13506129.2020.1868810,0

In vivo. proteolysis may modulate amyloidogenesis and fibril stability. In light chain (AL) amyloidosis. fragmented light chains (LCs) are abundant components of amyloid deposits; however. site and timing of proteolysis are debated. Identification of the N and C termini of LC fragments is instrumental to understanding involved processes and enzymes. We investigated the N and C terminome of the LC proteoforms in fibrils extracted from the hearts of two AL cardiomyopathy patients. using a proteomic approach based on derivatization of N- and C-terminal residues. followed by mapping of fragmentation sites on the structures of native and fibrillar relevant LCs.

Ying et al 1 unveil novel immune-mediated mechanisms by which monoclonal immunoglobulin free light chains (FLCs) induce kidney damage. further characterizing the inflammatory pathways activated by the tubular catabolism of these proteins. Endocytosed FLCs were shown previously to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and intracellular oxidative stress. H2O2 formed by FLCs through direct interaction with water was identified as the molecular event priming the activation of a proinflammatory pathway. 2. 3 Ying et al investigated how tubular epithelial cells sense this intracellular redox imbalance and transduce it into a proinflammatory and profibrotic response leading to chronic kidney damage in the absence of cell death.Among endogenous molecules driving renal injury. FLCs play a major role due to their glomerular clearance. The freely filtered FLCs are endocytosed and catabolized in the proximal tubule. When the amount of circulating FLCs is markedly increased. as is the case with multiple myeloma. the proximal tubule reabsorption capacity is overwhelmed and high FLC concentrations reach the distal tubule. where they may interact with Tamm-Horsfall protein. leading to the development of cast nephropathy. 4 Similarly. FLCs polymerizing and forming endolysosomal crystals is associated with tubular damage in Fanconi syndrome. 5 In both cases. tubular cell death promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β–driven inflammation. amplifying tubulointerstitial injury. 6,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:m8MyhXdlT-4C,0,https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(19)30970-9/abstract,,,,https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(19)30970-9/fulltext,0

Nowadays. the molecular details underling LCs soluble cardiotoxicity and fibril formation remain to be fully elucidated. It has been suggested a relationship between conformational flexibility and amyloidogenicity. indicating protein thermal stability and dynamics as factors able to influence the complex processes of misfolding and aggregation [2. 3]. To date. no compelling correlations have been identified between LCs cardiotoxicity and primary sequence. Here. we present a pivotal mutagenesis study in which we produce and characterize a mutated variant of the toxic H6 LC (mH6). Our purpose is to abrogate the toxicity typical of H6 yielding to a non-cardiotoxic LC and to understand the biophysical and biochemical changes underlying such loss of toxicity.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:QxlgOPrhsAcC,0,https://air.unimi.it/retrieve/handle/2434/665950/1361768/13506129.2019.pdf,,,,https://air.unimi.it/retrieve/handle/2434/665950/1361768/13506129.2019.pdf,0

It is caused by the overproduction and the aggregation of toxic and monoclonal immunoglobulin LCs in target organs. Among all the organs injured by the pathology. the heart is the most affected one. In particular. the ventricular compliance is reduced. resulting in a symptomatic congestive heart failure [1]. It is extremely relevant that due to the genetic rearrangement and somatic hypermutation. a high variability among LCse sequences is generated. This means. virtually. that each AL patients present different amyloidogenic LCs [2]. stressing in the necessity to investigate a large set of cases. To date. it is particularly interesting the observation described by Milani et al.[1]. where it was observed that the severity of heart symptoms is linked with the blood concentration of fulllength LCs. which are the major circulating species.

Cham,The amyloidoses constitute a large group of diseases in which misfolding of extracellular protein has a prominent role. This dynamic process generates insoluble. toxic protein aggregates that are deposited in tissues in bundles of β-sheet fibrillar protein (Lachmann and Hawkins 2006; Merlini and Bellotti 2003). Amyloid deposition may occur in the presence of an abnormal protein (hereditary amyloidosis and acquired systemic immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis) or in association with prolonged excess abundance of a normal protein (reactive systemic (AA) amyloidosis and beta-2-microglobulin dialysis-related amyloidosis); may accompany the ageing process for reasons unknown. for example. wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt; senile systemic amyloidosis).

In presence of a MGUS. an increased value of NT-proBNP could rise the suspicion of cardiac AL amyloidosis in absence of any other cardiologic disease.

AL amyloidosis is characterized by widespread deposition of immunoglobulin light chains (LCs) as amyloid fibrils. Cardiac involvement is frequent and leads to life-threatening cardiomyopathy. In addition to the tissue alteration caused by fibrils. clinical and experimental evidence indicates that cardiac damage is also caused by proteotoxicity of prefibrillar amyloidogenic species. As in other amyloidoses. the damage mechanisms at the cellular level are complex and largely undefined. Herein we sought to characterize the molecular changes occurring in primary human cells (cardiac fibroblasts. hCF) exposed in vitro to soluble amyloidogenic cardiotropic LCs. and control LC from patients with multiple myeloma. by evaluating their proteome.Methods.

The presence and severity of heart involvement at diagnosis is by far the most important prognostic factor in AL amyloidosis. and our ability to prognosticate survival and assess response to therapy based on cardiac biomarkers has revolutionized the management of this disease. However. very little is known on the impact of persisting cardiac dysfunction after upfront chemotherapy in patients with AL amyloidosis. This is particularly relevant to identify subjects who can benefit most from the different therapies targeting amyloid deposits that are currently being tested in clinical trials in patients who still have cardiac dysfunction after successful upfront therapy.Methods. The prospectively maintained database of the Pavia Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center was searched for patients who obtained at least a partial hematologic response (PR) after upfront therapy.

The diagnosis is frequently delayed or missed because of the limited specificity of echocardiography and the traditional requirement for histological confirmation. It has long been recognized that technetium-labeled bone scintigraphy tracers can localize to myocardial amyloid deposits. and use of this imaging modality for the diagnosis of cardiac ATTR amyloidosis has lately been revisited. We conducted a multicenter study to ascertain the diagnostic value of bone scintigraphy in this disease. Methods and Results-Results of bone scintigraphy and biochemical investigations were analyzed from 1217 patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis referred for evaluation in specialist centers. Of 857 patients with histologically proven amyloid (374 with endomyocardial biopsies) and 360 patients subsequently confirmed to have nonamyloid cardiomyopathies. myocardial radiotracer uptake on bone scintigraphy was > 99% sensitive and 86% specific for cardiac ATTR amyloid. with false positives almost exclusively from uptake in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis. Importantly. the combined findings of grade 2 or 3 myocardial radiotracer uptake on bone scintigraphy and the absence of a monoclonal protein in serum or urine had a specificity and positive predictive value for cardiac ATTR amyloidosis of 100%(positive predictive value confidence interval. 98.0-100).

Genetic testing identified pathogenic mutations in 7% of these cases. Familial history of stroke was the only significant specific feature that distinguished mutated patients from nonmutated ones. The presence of cerebrovascular risk factors did not exclude a genetic disease. Conclusions—In patients prescreened using a clinical algorithm for monogenic disorders. we identified monogenic causes of events in 7% of patients in comparison to …,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:FepLwMwnKBMC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3132238586237506158&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

64430,First European Congress on Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis,2015,Nadine Attal,10,Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases,1,I1,,Background: The Transthyretin-Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (TTRFAP) is a disease caused by deposition of mutant transthyretin (TTR). produced approximately 95% in the liver and the rest in the plexus choroideus and retina. In 1990 the first TTR-FAP patient liver transplant was performed. The liver transplant. which suppresses TTR synthesis. was the only treatment available to modify this disease until 2011. when the European Medicines Agency approved Tafamidis. a TTR stabilizer. for stage I patients (Val30Met and non-Val30Met). To improve upon the pre-existing therapy of liver transplants and given the results of 68% of Tafamidis respondents. other disease-modifying therapeutic approaches were developed: Silencers. Stabilizers. Degraders and Reabsorption agents. In light of these multiple agents clinical trials are the key to improve TTR-FAP treatment.Objectives: The aim of the analysis is to determine eligibility criteria and optimal timing of patient’s enrollment in a clinical trial. Methods: We reviewed the literature using the online database PUBMED. Standard search strategies were applied using the following MESH terms alone or in combination: amyloidosis. transthyretin. liver transplant. tafamidis and clinical trial. Evaluation of the bibliographies was done in order to select relevant articles. Additionally. clinical experience achieved by lead investigators and our own experience was applied in this analysis.

Cham,The diagnosis of amyloidosis requires that amyloid deposits are demonstrated in patient’s tissues. Congo red staining is still the most commonly used method to detect amyloid deposits. Nevertheless. the results of Congo red stain may be ambiguous. especially if it is performed in centers with limited expertise in its execution and/or interpretation. Furthermore. Congo red stain does not provide any information concerning the nature of amyloidogenic protein. The characterization of amyloid proteins by light microscopic immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded samples frequently yields nonspecific results. On the basis of our experience at the Amyloid Center and Pathology Unit of IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo/University of Pavia. the ultrastructural examination of abdominal fat aspirate and other tissue biopsies is capable of confirming or ruling out a diagnosis of amyloidosis and can detect even very small …,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:ynsZFq2pu0MC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19294-9_22,,,,,0

Early small studies from our groups and others reported unprecedented response rates (up to 90%. with 65% complete remissions) in patients with AL amyloidosis treated with the combination of cyclophosphamide. bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD). Based on these results CyBorD has become one of the most commonly prescribed frontline regimens in AL amyloidosis outside clinical trials. Subsequently. however. we have shown that this regimen is unable to overcome the poor prognosis of patients with advanced cardiac disease. There is the need of large studies to identify patients who benefit most from this highly effective regime in AL amyloidosis. Patients and Methods.

The prognosis of patients with AL amyloidosis is mainly driven by the severity of heart involvement. Cardiac amyloidosis is being extensively studied. and accurate staging systems have been developed to identify patients with different degrees of heart dysfunction who are candidates for different treatment approaches. However. little is known on the outcome of patients without heart involvement who are generally considered low-risk. In the present study we evaluated factors affecting survival of patients with non-cardiac AL amyloidosis. Patients and Methods. The subjects (n=135) without cardiac involvement (NT-proBNP <332 ng/L and mean left ventricular wall thickness at echocardiography £12 mm) and with normal troponin (Mayo Clinic stage I) were selected form the prospectively maintained database including 748 consecutive. previously untreated patients with AL …,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:1xBWf43XMUgC,0,https://ashpublications.org/blood/article-abstract/124/21/3361/97949,,,,,0

The mouse immune response to casein has been extensively investigated: low levels of anti-casein antibodies have been detected in the serum of mice injected with casein. Such low immune response has been attributed to oral tolerization by the substantial amount of casein present in normal mouse chow diet. An experimental system equivalent to primary (AL) amyloid disease in man has not been demonstrated. and the possible role of dietary casein in this disease has not been thoroughly investigated. We report the results of an investigation of serum anti-casein antibodies in patients with amyloidosis. 35 patients with AL amyloidosis. 39 with plasma cell dyscrasias apparently not associated with amyloidosis and 10 normal individuals were screened for anti-casein antibodies by an ELISA method. Low levels of anti-casein antibodies were found in 80% of patients with amyloidosis. significantly (p= 0.001) higher than in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias (38%) or normal individuals (30%). The possible significance of these anti-casein antibodies present in low concentrations in a high percentage of patients with AL amyloidosis is discussed.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:nOiSByfp82kC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=25rlBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA17&dq=info:c5uZbCNQfY4J:scholar.google.com&ots=U-T0hLHe4S&sig=29XjWdGEPJEMJ1nwN6iooywfPc8,,,,,0

This process. referred to as neo-angiogenesis. relies on the synthesis of specific growth factors. such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors. by tumor cells. Thus. anti-angiogenic drugs (so-called target therapy) by blocking the neo-angiogenic process and inducing its regression. could play a relevant role in the multimodal treatment of certain solid tumors. Neo-angiogenesis can be studied and quantified through imaging techniques such as perfusion computed tomography (CT). magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS).The first aim of this study was to evaluate the conversion rate from not-resectable to resectable in patients with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer after first-line anti-VEGF therapy with bevacizumab.

The aims of our study were to evaluate serum leptin. resistin. visfatin and adiponectin levels in patients with tumour necrosis factor receptorassociated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). in comparison to healthy controls. and to correlate their levels to parameters of disease activity and/or severity. Methods. Serum leptin. resistin. visfatin and adiponectin levels were obtained from 14 TRAPS patients carrying mutations involving cysteine residues. from 16 TRAPS patients carrying other mutations. and from 16 healthy controls. Demographic. clinical and laboratory parameters. including amyloidosis were entered for each patient. Comparisons between groups as well as reciprocal comparisons have been evaluated.Results. Serum leptin. resistin. visfatin and adiponectin did not significantly differ among the 3 groups. Patients carrying cysteine residues mutations showed lower visfatin serum levels than patients carrying other mutations (p< 0.02). Serum leptin significantly correlated with the number of attacks/year (multiple R= 0.32. multiple adjusted R2= 0.19. p< 0.03). Serum adiponectin levels significantly correlated with the presence of amyloidosis (multiple R= 0.79. multiple adjusted R2= 0.57. p< 0.03). Adiponectin values were a significant predictor for amyloidosis (AUC 0.75. 95 CI: 0.56–0.94. p< 0.03). with a predicting cut-off value set at 23.16 pg/ml. the predictive positive value was 53.8%. Visfatin serum levels resulted respectively related to leptin (rs= 0.42. r2= 0.18. p< 0.02) and to resistin (rs= 0.57. r2= 0.32. p< 0.01) serum levels; whilst leptin and resistin serum levels did not reciprocally correlate.Conclusion.

Un riconoscimento precoce della malattia ed un inizio immediato della terapia sono pertanto di estrema importanza. I pazienti affetti da amiloidosi AL cardiaca presentano spesso alterazioni elettrocardiografiche caratteristiche quali i bassi voltaggi nelle derivazioni periferiche e la pseudonecrosi. Questo lavoro riporta le graduali modificazioni elettrocardiografiche osservate in 4 pazienti analizzando retrospettivamente i tracciati prima della diagnosi di amiloidosi cardiaca AL. Complessivamente abbiamo potuto osservare la comparsa nel tempo di pseudonecrosi. di bassi voltaggi periferici e una riduzione dell’ampiezza periferica e precordiale del QRS. fino al raggiungimento del quadro elettrocardiografico caratteristico di amiloidosi cardiaca. Pur non presentando una specificità diagnostica paragonabile a quella dei marcatori cardiaci o dell’ecocardiografia. un esame non invasivo. di semplice esecuzione e lettura oltre che economico come l’ECG potrebbe accelerare il processo diagnostico. soprattutto quando si valutano in modo critico tracciati seriati. o si confrontano ECG precedenti di cui spesso i paziente dispongono.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:3NQIlFlcGxIC,0,http://193.204.40.129/index.php/bsmc/article/view/1157,,,,http://193.204.40.129/index.php/bsmc/article/viewFile/1157/1237,0

L’amiloidosi AL. in cui le fibrille sono composte dalla porzione N-terminale della catena leggera di un’immunoglobulina. ha un’incidenza all’incirca di 1 caso ogni 100.000 persone anno nei paesi occidentali. Il coinvolgimento cardiaco non è solo frequente. ma è anche la più comune causa di morte. Nell’amiloidosi cardiaca AL l’elettrocardiogramma a 12 derivazioni (ECG) riflette la natura infiltrativa generalizzata della malattia. mostrando bassi voltaggi nelle derivazioni periferiche. un pattern di pseudonecrosi nelle derivazioni precordiali anteriori e/o inferiori. e difetti di conduzione come ad esempio blocchi fascicolari o vari gradi di blocchi atrioventricolari. Inoltre. non è infrequente osservare anomalie aspecifiche del complesso QRS. come indentature (notches) e pattern RsR’senza prolungamento del QRS. Nel contesto della cardiopatia ischemica o della cardiomiopatia dilatativa. queste alterazioni della morfologia del QRS. che portano ad un ritardo di conduzione o alla frammentazione del complesso QRS (fQRS). sono state associate alla presenza di cicatrice miocardica. Dal momento che nell’amiloidosi il danno ai cardiomiociti e la fibrosi interstiziale sono correlati alla deposizione cardiaca di sostanza amiloide. lo scopo che questo studio si prefigge è quello di analizzare la prevalenza di fQRS nei pazienti con amiloidosi cardiaca. e valutare se questo dato abbia un valore prognostico.,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC,0,http://193.204.40.129/index.php/bsmc/article/view/1049,,,,http://193.204.40.129/index.php/bsmc/article/download/1049/1126,0

L’evento terminale è spesso rappresentato da morte cardiaca improvvisa. per tachiaritmie. bradiaritmie e/o dissociazione elettro-meccanica. Allo scopo di verificare l’eventuale associazione tra tali eventi aritmici e ritardi della conduzione rilevabili mediante ECG standard a 12 derivazioni. abbiamo valutato prevalenza ed impatto prognostico dei disturbi della conduzione in una popolazione di 337 pazienti affetti da amiloidosi AL. consecutivi. seguiti per un follow-up mediano pari a 402 giorni. La prevalenza di ritardi della conduzione è risultata significativamente maggiore nei pazienti con amiloidosi cardiaca AL rispetto ai soggetti senza interessamento cardiaco (rispettivamente 41% vs 24%. p< 0.05). Lo studio della relazione con parametri di morfologia. funzione diastolica e funzione sistolica (spessore del setto interventricolare. rapporto E/E’all’indagine Doppler ed escursione longitudinale dell’anello mitralico o MAPSE) ha permesso di delineare un quadro ecocardiografico significativamente peggiore nei pazienti con cardiopatia amiloidotica AL e disturbi della conduzione.

Il deposito a livello cardiaco è quello che determina in maniera precipua la prognosi e le scelte terapeutiche. La prevalenza di fibrillazione atriale nei pazienti affetti da cardiopatia amiloidotica AL riportata in letteratura è pari al 10-15%. Questo dato di prevalenza non sembra essere in linea con quanto attendibile in base al tipo di cardiopatia. caratterizzata tipicamente da marcata disfunzione diastolica. e alle dimensioni atriali dei pazienti affetti da tale patologia. Nel nostro studio su una casistica di 161 pazienti affetti da amiloidosi cardiaca AL. abbiamo voluto analizzare la prevalenza di fibrillazione atriale alla diagnosi e confrontarla con quella riportate in altri studi su cardiopatie a fenotipo assimilabile. ossia su coorti di pazienti affetti da ipertensione arteriosa con ipertrofia ventricolare sinistra (studio LIFE). insufficienza cardiaca (Cardiovascular Health Study) e cardiomiopatia ipertrofica (Registro Italiano della Cardiomiopatia Ipertrofica). Nel confronto tra le diverse popolazioni sono stati presi in considerazione i dati relativi alle dimensioni atriali. che come noto rappresentano uno dei principali determinanti dell’insorgenza di fibrillazione atriale. Nella popolazione di pazienti affetti da cardiopatia amiloidotica. la prevalenza di fibrillazione atriale è risultata essere pari all’8.3%. nettamente inferiore rispetto a quella riscontrata nelle altre popolazioni di cardiopatici (insufficienza cardiaca: 15.7-16.9%. cardiomiopatia ipertrofica: 17%) e superiore a quella osservata nella cardiopatia ipertensiva …,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC,0,http://193.204.40.129/index.php/bsmc/article/view/1071,,,,http://193.204.40.129/index.php/bsmc/article/download/1071/1137,0

The prevalence of MGUS increases with age. from 1.7% in those 50 to 59 years old to> 5% in those older than 70 years. MGUS is associated with an increased risk of multiple myeloma or related malignancies at a rate of 1% per year. Recently. it has been proposed to add the measurement of N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) to traditional tests used for monitoring MGUS to timely detect initial cardiac amyloid involvement. In this report. we present the case of a patient with MGUS who was followed at our center since February 2006.

A subset of FLC. as amyloidogenic ones. possess intrinsic pathogenicity. Because of their complex purification. little is known on the biochemical features of serum FLC. possibly related to their pathogenic spectrum. We developed an immunopurification approach to isolate serum FLC from patients with monoclonal gammopathies. followed by proteomic characterization. Serum monoclonal FLC were detected and quantified by immunofixation and immunonephelometry. Immunoprecipitation was performed by serum incubation with agarose beads covalently linked to polyclonal anti-κ or λ FLC antibodies. Isolated FLC were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. 2D-PAGE. immunoblotting. mass spectrometry (MS). Serum FLC were immunoprecipitated from 15 patients with ALλ amyloidosis (serum λ FLC range: 98–2350mg/L). 5 with ALκ amyloidosis and 1 with κ light chain (LC) myeloma (κ FLC range: 266–2660mg/L). and 3 controls. Monoclonal FLC were the prevalent eluted species in patients. On 2D-PAGE. both λ and κ FLC originated discrete spots with multiple pI isoforms. The nature of eluted FLC and coincidence with the LC sequence from the bone marrow clone was confirmed by MS. which also detected post-translational modifications. including truncation. tryptophan oxidation. cysteinylation. peptide dimerization. Serum FLC were purified in soluble form and adequate amounts for proteomics. which allowed studying primary sequence and detecting post-translational modifications.

Subcutaneous abdominal fat aspiration is the easiest. most common diagnostic procedure. We developed a novel. automated approach. based on Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT). for typing amyloidosis. Fat aspirates were obtained from patients with the most common systemic amyloidoses (AL. ATTR. AA). with Congo red score≥ 3+. and non-affected controls. Peptides from extracted and digested proteins were analyzed by MudPIT. Upon semiquantitative differential analysis (patients vs controls) of mass spectrometry (MS) data. specific proteins up-represented in patients were identified and used as deposit biomarkers. An algorithm was developed to classify patients according to type and abundance of amyloidogenic proteins in samples; in all cases proteomic characterization was concordant with fibril identification by immuno-electron microscopy and consistent with clinical presentation.

We have previously described that two types of amyloid fibril compositions exist among Swedish ATTRV30M amyloidosis patients. one consisting of a mixture of intact and fragmented ATTR (type A) and one composed of only intact ATTR (type B). Patients with type A fibrils have a late age of onset and signs of cardiomyopathy. while patients with type B fibrils have an early onset and much less myocardial involvement.The present study aimed to determine if the correlation between fibril type and clinical phenotype is true for familial amyloidosis in general. Cardiac and/or adipose tissue from 48 patients carrying 21 different non-TTRV30M mutations were examined. as well as 7 non-Swedish ATTRV30M patients.

Cardiac biomarkers. troponins. and particularly the natriuretic peptide type B (NT-proBNP). are very sensitive and reliable sensors of light chain cardiotoxicity and allow early assessment of cardiac response to therapy. They are also powerful prognostic determinants used to stratify the risk according to the Mayo cardiac staging system. 5 The light chain–induced cardiac damage is progressive. but potentially reversible. unless the myocardial lesions are advanced. Improvement of cardiac function after therapy. assessed by NT-proBNP. translates into improved survival. 6. 7 Thus. the strategy for improving survival in AL amyloidosis should be based on early detection of amyloid cardiac involvement while the damage is still reversible. and on the rapid and profound reduction of the amyloid light chain concentration to arrest the progression of the cardiac damage and rescue the heart’s function. The most sensitive. although not specific. marker of early cardiac involvement is NT-proBNP. which can anticipate the onset of symptoms related to heart failure by several months. 8 Because patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) are at risk. albeit low. of developing AL amyloidosis it would be advisable that periodic checkups of individuals with this …,True,NmFNYEgAAAAJ:1yWc8FF-_SYC,0,http://archiwum.szpiczak.org/lang/szpiczak/pdf/amyloidoza/450_cybord_merlini_response_2012.pdf,,,,http://archiwum.szpiczak.org/lang/szpiczak/pdf/amyloidoza/450_cybord_merlini_response_2012.pdf,0
