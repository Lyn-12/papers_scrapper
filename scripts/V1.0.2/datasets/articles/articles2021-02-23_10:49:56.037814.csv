1054662,Upconversion based temperature sensing ability of Er3+–Yb3+ codoped SrWO4: an optical heating phosphor,2015,Anurag Pandey and Vineet Kumar Rai and Vinod Kumar and Vijay Kumar and HC Swart,209,Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical,,352-358,Elsevier,The present paper covers a detail explanation about the laser induced optical heating and temperature sensing ability of intense green upconversion emitting Er3+–Yb3+ codoped SrWO4 phosphor. The structural studies based on X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared analysis confirmed the phase formation. crystallinity and the presence of vibrational bands of the corresponding host lattice. The optical investigation was performed by recording the diffuse reflectance and upconversion emission spectra upon a 980 nm excitation. Multiphoton upconversion processes were confirmed by pump power dependence study for the various emission bands throughout the visible region. Optical thermometry has been performed using the fluorescence intensity ratio technique in which two thermally coupled levels of the green emission bands were used. A relatively low temperature (518 K) sensor with very high …,True,rIZN3aQAAAAJ:-mN3Mh-tlDkC,246,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400514015214,13824483198577312123,/scholar?cites=13824483198577312123,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47360956/Upconversion_based_temperature_sensing_a20160719-6723-v0qp52.pdf,0,0,0
1054664,Origin of the red emission in zinc oxide nanophosphors,2013,Vinod Kumar and HC Swart and OM Ntwaeaborwa and RE Kroon and JJ Terblans and SKK Shaat and A Yousif and MM Duvenhage,101,Materials Letters,,57-60,North-Holland,UV and orange-red light emitting zinc oxide nano-phosphors (ZnO NPr) were synthesised by a combustion method using zinc nitrate and zinc acetate as precursors and urea as a fuel. Hexagonal wurtzite structures of ZnO were synthesised. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that the O1s peak consist of three components: O1 (ZnO). O2 (deficient oxygen; OH groups) and O3 (adsorbed species) centred at 530.3. 531.2 and 532.6 eV. respectively. A broad orange-red emission from 500 to 850 nm was obtained from the ZnO NPr prepared with the nitrate precursor which may be attributed to different kinds of defects. and a sharp UV band. due to the possible passivation of defects. at 392 nm from ZnO NPr prepared with acetate precursor.,True,rIZN3aQAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C,212,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167577X13004011,15935502768807231670,/scholar?cites=15935502768807231670,,,0,0,0
1054666,Defect correlated fluorescent quenching and electron phonon coupling in the spectral transition of Eu3+ in CaTiO3 for red emission in display application,2014,S Som and AK Kunti and Vinod Kumar and Vijay Kumar and S Dutta and M Chowdhury and SK Sharma and JJ Terblans and HC Swart,115,Journal of Applied Physics,19,193101,American Institute of Physics,This paper reports on the defect correlated self-quenching and spectroscopic investigation of calcium titanate (CaTiO3) phosphors. A series of CaTiO3 phosphors doped with trivalent europium (Eu3+) and codoped with potassium (K+) ions were prepared by the solid state reaction method. The X-ray diffraction results revealed that the obtained powder phosphors consisted out of a single-phase orthorhombic structure and it also indicated that the incorporation of the dopants/co-dopants did not affect the crystal structure. The scanning electron microscopy images revealed the irregular morphology of the prepared phosphors consisting out of μm sized diameter particles. The Eu3+ doped phosphors illuminated with ultraviolet light showed the characteristic red luminescence corresponding to the 5D0→7FJ transitions of Eu3+. As a charge compensator. K+ ions were incorporated into the CaTiO3:Eu3+ phosphors. which …,True,rIZN3aQAAAAJ:QD3KBmkZPeQC,199,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4876316,15021858914288677600,/scholar?cites=15021858914288677600,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vijay_Kumar155/publication/262416940_Defect_correlated_fluorescent_quenching_and_electron_phonon_coupling_in_the_spectral_transition_of_Eu3_in_CaTiO3_for_red_emission_in_display_application/links/0a85e5374c8a7c64ac000000/Defect-correlated-fluorescent-quenching-and-electron-phonon-coupling-in-the-spectral-transition-of-Eu3-in-CaTiO3-for-red-emission-in-display-application.pdf,0,0,0

After reviewing the range of voltages and phosphors being used in first generation devices. the improved properties of future generation phosphors are reviewed. Specifically. next generation displays will require better low voltage efficiencies. chromaticity. saturation behavior. and maintenance. Possible routes to achieve these improvements are discussed. The improved understanding of the role of charging and surface recombination effects on cathodoluminescent intensity and efficiency is reviewed. An improved understanding of electron beam-stimulated surface chemical reaction effects on the degradation of phosphor is presented. It is concluded that recent research efforts have created a new level of understanding of FED phosphors. and this should lead to the necessary improvements in properties.,True,rIZN3aQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,194,https://avs.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1116/1.590634,9705475081712444433,/scholar?cites=9705475081712444433,,,0,0,0
