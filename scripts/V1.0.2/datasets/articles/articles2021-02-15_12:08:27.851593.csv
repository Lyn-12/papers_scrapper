They were designed on the basis of partial enzyme amino acid sequences. The gene was found to encode a 882 residues polypeptide chain with a deduced molecular mass of about 100 kDa. By comparison with other archaeal genes. putative regulatory sites were identified in the gene-flanking regions.

Here. we report that two Y‐family DNA polymerases of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus strains P1 and P2 incorporate oxidized dNTPs into nascent DNA in an erroneous manner: the polymerases exclusively incorporate 8‐OH‐dGTP opposite adenine in the template. and incorporate 2‐OH‐dATP opposite guanine more efficiently than opposite thymine.

The lectin pathway of the complement system activates after infection and oxidative stress on endothelial cells generating active serine proteases: MASP-1 and MASP-2. Our aim was to study whether activated MASPs are able to digest HK to release BK. Initially we were trying to find potential new substrates of MASP-1 in human plasma by differential gel electrophoresis. and we identified kininogen cleavage products by this proteomic approach. As a control. MASP-2 was included in the study in addition to MASP-1 and kallikrein. The proteolytic cleavage of HK by MASPs was followed by SDS-PAGE. and BK release was detected by HPLC. We showed that MASP-1 was able to cleave HK resulting in BK production. MASP-2 could also cleave HK but could not release BK. The cleavage pattern of MASPs is similar but not strictly identical to that of kallikrein.

Plant defensins are encoded by small multigene families and are expressed in various plant tissues. but are best characterized in seeds. They are typically produced as preproteins. however. a small subset are produced as larger precursors with C-terminal prodomains. To date. the three-dimensional solution structures of seven seed- and two floral-derived defensins have been elucidated by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Despite limited amino acid sequence identities. these defensins have comparable global folds with features that are characteristic of the cysteine-stabilized αβ (CSαβ) motif.

Many CAPs act at the plasma membrane of cells leading to membrane destabilization and permeabilization. In this study. we describe a novel cell lysis mechanism for fungal and tumor cells by the plant defensin NaD1 that acts via direct binding to the plasma membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4.5-bisphosphate (PIP2). We determined the crystal structure of a NaD1:PIP2 complex. revealing a striking oligomeric arrangement comprising seven dimers of NaD1 that cooperatively bind the anionic headgroups of 14 PIP2 molecules through a unique ‘cationic grip’ configuration. Site-directed mutagenesis of NaD1 confirms that PIP2-mediated oligomerization is important for fungal and tumor cell permeabilization. These observations identify an innate recognition system by NaD1 for direct binding of PIP2 that permeabilizes cells via a novel membrane disrupting mechanism.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01808.001,True,lL4E7YAAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,122,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01808,4316312507213031485,/scholar?cites=4316312507213031485,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01808.pdf,0,0,0

Several BTB domain structures have been experimentally determined. revealing a highly conserved core structure. We surveyed the protein architecture. genomic distribution and sequence conservation of BTB domain proteins in 17 fully sequenced eukaryotes. The BTB domain is typically found as a single copy in proteins that contain only one or two other types of domain. and this defines the BTB-zinc finger (BTB-ZF). BTB-BACK-kelch (BBK). voltage-gated potassium channel T1 (T1-Kv). MATH-BTB. BTB-NPH3 and BTB-BACK-PHR (BBP) families of proteins. among others. In contrast. the Skp1 and ElonginC proteins consist almost exclusively of the core BTB fold. There are numerous lineage-specific expansions of BTB proteins. as seen by the relatively large number of BTB-ZF and BBK proteins in vertebrates. MATH-BTB proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans. and BTB-NPH3 proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using the structural homology between Skp1 and the PLZF BTB homodimer. we present a model of a BTB-Cul3 SCF-like E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that shows that the BTB dimer or the T1 tetramer is compatible in this complex. Despite widely divergent sequences. the BTB fold is structurally well conserved.

We found a clade of polyspecific receptors. including one that is sensitive to picomolar concentrations of strigolactone. A crystal structure of a highly sensitive strigolactone receptor from Striga revealed a larger binding pocket than that of the Arabidopsis receptor. which could explain the increased range of strigolactone sensitivity.

Legionella pneumophila. an intracellular pathogen that can cause a severe pneumonia in humans. is able to modulate autophagy through the action of effector proteins that are translocated into the host cell by the pathogen’s Dot/Icm type IV secretion system. Many of these effectors share structural and sequence similarity with eukaryotic proteins. Indeed. phylogenetic analyses have indicated their acquisition by horizontal gene transfer from a eukaryotic host. Here we report that L. pneumophila translocates the effector protein sphingosine-1 phosphate lyase (LpSpl) to target the host sphingosine biosynthesis and to curtail autophagy.

The mice drawer system (MDS) program. sponsored by Italian Space Agency. for the first time aimed to investigate the consequences of long-term (91 days) exposure to microgravity in mice within the International Space Station. Muscle atrophy was present indistinctly in all fiber types of the slow-twitch soleus muscle. but was only slightly greater than that observed after 20 days of spaceflight. Myosin heavy chain analysis indicated a concomitant slow-to-fast transition of soleus. In addition. spaceflight induced translocation of sarcolemmal nitric oxide synthase-1 (NOS1) into the cytosol in soleus but not in the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. Most of the sarcolemmal ion channel subunits were up-regulated. more in soleus than EDL. whereas Ca2+-activated K+ channels were down-regulated. consistent with the phenotype transition. Gene expression of the atrophy-related ubiquitin-ligases was up-regulated in both spaceflown soleus and EDL muscles. whereas autophagy genes were in the control range. Muscle-specific IGF-1 and interleukin-6 were down-regulated in soleus but up-regulated in EDL. Also. various stress-related genes were up-regulated in spaceflown EDL. not in soleus.

The computational domain includes the entire submerged entry nozzle (SEN) starting from the tundish exit and the complete mold region. The results show a large. elongated recirculation zone in the SEN below the slide gate. The simulation also shows that the flow exiting the nozzle ports has a complex time-evolving pattern with strong cross-stream velocities. which is also seen in the experiments. With a few exceptions. which are probably due to uncertainties in the measurements. the computed flow field agrees with the measurements.

The light chain-binding region of myosin is thought to act as a lever arm that amplifies movements near the catalytic site. This model has been challenged by findings that myosin VI takes larger steps along actin filaments than early interpretations of its structure seem to allow.

Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a disorder of intracellular transport where glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and cholesterol accumulate in endosomal compartments. The mechanisms of altered intracellular trafficking are not known but may involve the mistargeting and disrupted function of proteins associated with GSL membrane microdomains.

Ceramide. the central molecule in cellular glycosphingolipid metabolism. has recently been identified as an important mediator of this process. Indeed. one of the events elicited by application of many cytotoxic drugs is an accumulation of this lipid. Treatment failure in cancer chemotherapy is largely attributable to multidrug resistance. in which tumor cells are typically cross-resistant to multiple chemotherapeutic agents.

Mutations that either inhibit or stimulate inclusion of the upstream alternative exon deeply affect inclusion of the downstream one. However. similar mutations at the downstream alternative exon have little effect on the upstream one. This polar effect is promoter specific and is enhanced by inhibition of transcriptional elongation. Consistently. cells from mutant mice with either constitutive or null inclusion of a fibronectin alternative exon revealed coordination with a second alternative splicing region. located far downstream.

Despite conservation of its basic structure and function. autoinhibition by one of its rotary stalk subunits occurs in bacteria and chloroplasts but not in mitochondria. The crystal structure of the ATP synthase catalytic complex (F 1) from Escherichia coli described here reveals the structural basis for this inhibition. The C-terminal domain of subunit ɛ adopts a heretofore unknown. highly extended conformation that inserts deeply into the central cavity of the enzyme and engages both rotor and stator subunits in extensive contacts that are incompatible with functional rotation. As a result. the three catalytic subunits are stabilized in a set of conformations and rotational positions distinct from previous F 1 structures.,True,1Y9rUO8AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,217,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb.2058.pdf?origin=ppub,352849081722871984,/scholar?cites=352849081722871984,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3109198/,0,0,0

A βD380C/γC87 crosslinked hybrid F1 having epitope-tagged βD380C subunits (βflag) exclusively in the two noncrosslinked positions was bound to Fo in F1-depleted membranes. After reduction of the β–γ crosslink. a brief exposure to conditions for ATP synthesis followed by reoxidation resulted in a significant amount of βflag appearing in the β–γ crosslinked product. Such a reorientation of γC87 relative to the three β subunits can only occur through subunit rotation. Rotation was inhibited when proton transport through Fo was blocked or when ADP and Pi were omitted.

Here we review earlier evidence both for and against subunit rotation and then discuss our most recent studies using reversible intersubunit disulfide cross-links to test for rotation. We conclude that the γ subunit of F1 rotates relative to the surrounding catalytic subunits during catalytic turnover by both soluble F1 and membrane-bound F0F1.

Bacterial F-type ATP synthase is the target of a new. FDA-approved antibiotic to combat drug-resistant tuberculosis. Understanding bacteria-specific auto-inhibition of ATP synthase by the C-terminal domain of subunit ε could provide a new means to target the enzyme for discovery of antibacterial drugs. The C-terminal domain of ε undergoes a dramatic conformational change when the enzyme transitions between the active and inactive states. and catalytic-site ligands can influence which of ε's conformations is predominant.

This nonenzymic model reaction for alcohol dehydrogenase supports the view that the catalytic function of the zinc ion at the active site of alcohol dehydrogenase is to polarize the carbonyl group of the aldehyde substrates and to facili-tate the deprotonation of the hydroxyl group of alcohol substrates. The model reaction proceeds by direct hydrogen transfer. is absolutely dependent on zinc ion. and is insensitive to free-radical quenchingagents such as dihydroquinone. The disparity between the kinetic isotope effects and the isotopic partitioning ratio indicates that an intermediate forms during the course of the reaction. The zinc ion catalyzed reductionof 2-and 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde by tetraethylammonium borohydride is consistent with coordination or proximity of the metal ion to the …,True,Y0y1p2cAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,103,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00431a047,17282019908850456462,/scholar?cites=17282019908850456462,,,0,0,0
1027239,Brief history of glyoxalase I and what we have learned about metal ion-dependent. enzyme-catalyzed isomerizations,2001,Donald J Creighton and Diana S Hamilton,387,Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics,1,1-10,Academic Press,Glyoxalase I. a member of the metalloglutathione (GSH) transferase superfamily. plays a critical detoxification role in cells by catalyzing the conversion of cytotoxic methylglyoxal (as the diastereomeric GSH-thiohemiacetals) to S-d-lactoylglutathione via a 1. 2-hydrogen transfer. The mechanism-of-action of this Zn 2+-metalloenzyme has been the subject of considerable controversy over the past 50 years. Key issues relate to the role of the active-site metal ion in catalysis and how the enzyme is able to use directly both diastereomeric thiohemiacetals as substrates. The results of recent X-ray crystallographic measurements on the enzyme in complex with a transition state analogue and site-directed mutagenesis studies now strongly support a base-mediated. proton-transfer mechanism in which the bound diastereomeric substrates undergo catalytic interconversion before the 1S-diastereomer goes to product via a Zn …,True,Y0y1p2cAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,94,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003986100922537,14874981475911119770,/scholar?cites=14874981475911119770,,,0,0,0
1027240,Active monomeric and dimeric forms of Pseudomonas putida glyoxalase I: evidence for 3D domain swapping,1998,André P Saint-Jean and Kristina R Phillips and Donald J Creighton and Martin J Stone,37,Biochemistry,29,10345-10353,American Chemical Society,3D domain swapping of proteins involves the interconversion of a monomer containing a single domain−domain interface and a 2-fold symmetrical dimer containing two equivalent intermolecular interfaces. Human glyoxalase I has the structure of a domain-swapped dimer [Cameron. A. D.. Olin. B.. Ridderström. M.. Mannervik. B.. and Jones. T. A. (1997) EMBO J. 16. 3386−3395] but Pseudomonas putida glyoxalase I has been reported to be monomeric [Rhee. H.-I.. Murata. K.. and Kimura. A. (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 141. 993−999]. We show here that recombinant P. putida glyoxalase I is an active dimer (kcat ∼500 ± 100 s-1; KM ∼0.4 ± 0.2 mM) with two zinc ions per dimer. The zinc is required for structure and function. However. treatment of the dimer with glutathione yields an active monomer (kcat ∼115 ± 40 s-1; KM ∼1.4 ± 0.4 mM) containing a single zinc ion. The monomer is metastable and …,True,Y0y1p2cAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,91,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi980868q,1433014773998533042,/scholar?cites=1433014773998533042,,,0,0,0
1027241,Model for alcohol dehydrogenase. Zinc ion catalyzed reduction of 1. 10-phenanthroline-2-carboxyaldehyde by N-propyl-1. 4-dihydronicotinamide,1971,Donald J Creighton and David S Sigman,93,Journal of the American Chemical Society,23,6314-6316,American Chemical Society,The Zn2+-I complex was chosen for study since 1. 10-phenanthroline derivatives generally have a high affinity for zinc ion and construction of molecular models of the complex indicated that the carbonyl group of the aldehyde could coordinate to the metal ion. This latter interaction is possibly analogousto the suggested coor-dination of the aldehyde to the enzymic zinc in the reac-tive enzyme-NADH-aldehyde ternary complex. The zinc ion catalyzed reaction between I and III was car-ried out in anhydrous acetonitrile instead of water since the true substrates for alcohol dehydrogenase are the unhydrated aldehydes and not their hydrated or alde-hydrol forms. 16 In aqueous acetonitrile. theZn2+-T complex exists predominantly in the hydrated form. One inherent disadvantage of this system is that the zinc ion may promote reduction of the aldehyde by an indirect electronic effect through the aromatic ring system in …,True,Y0y1p2cAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,88,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00752a079,686861970646164885,/scholar?cites=686861970646164885,,,0,0,0
