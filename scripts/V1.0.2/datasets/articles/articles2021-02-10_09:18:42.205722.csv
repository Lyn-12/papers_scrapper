In the current study. we investigated the total antioxidant. metal chelating. Fe3+ and Cu2+ reduction. and free radical scavenging activities of some phenolic and flavonoid compounds including malvin. oenin. ID-8. silychristin. callistephin. pelargonin. 3.4-dihydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid. 2.4.6-trihydroxybenzaldehyde. and arachidonoyl dopamine. The antioxidant properties of these compounds at different concentrations (10–30 μg/mL) were compared with those of reference antioxidants such as BHA. BHT. α-tocopherol. and trolox. Each substance showed dose-dependent antioxidant activity. Furthermore. oenin. malvin. arachidonoyl dopamine. callistephin. silychristin. and 3.4-dihydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid exhibited more effective antioxidant activity than that observed for the reference antioxidants. These results suggest that these novel compounds may function to protect foods and medicines and to reduce oxidative stress in vivo.,True,96-3Bu8AAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC,101,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bri/2017/7616791/abs/,1704498173896340490,/scholar?cites=1704498173896340490,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bri/2017/7616791/abs/,0,0,0

In this experiment. 40 Wistar adult rats were utilized and divided randomly into five groups. After 24 h of CIS administration. liver and kidneys were harvested and assessed by H&E staining. Also. markers for oxidative stress and antioxidants were analyzed in theses tissues. Compared to the control group. accumulation of malondialdehyde was increased in groups treated CIS. whereas superoxide dismutase activities and glutathione levels were distinctly diminished in this group. The study’s histopathological findings such as hydropic degeneration. vascular congestion. sinusoidal dilatation in hepatocytes and tubular necrosis in kidneys were in accordance with the results of markers for oxidative stress.

105962,In Veterinary Medicine,2003,G Ameni and M Tibbo,1,International Journal of Applied,4,,,A cross-sectional study to determine individual animal prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) was conducted on 1171 dairy cattle in 12 randomly selected dairy farms in Ethiopia between January 1999 and May 2001 using comparative intradermal tuberculin (CIT) test and bacteriologic study through milk culturing. An overall individual animal prevalence of 46.8%(548 of 1171 animals) and a herd prevalence of 91.7%(11 of 12 farms) were recorded in 12 dairy farms by the CIT test. There were significant (P< 0.0001) differences in individual prevalence between farms and breeds (pure Holstein and their crosses with Zebu). There was positive correlation (r= 0.41) between herd size and prevalence of bovine tuberculosis. Furthermore. a negative linear association (R2= 0.24) was found between mean score of management of the farm and prevalence. indicating that the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis could be improved by sanitary measures. Breed and management affected the prevalence of BTB (R2= 0.30) as confounding variables. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from the milk of 13.3%(4 of 30) reactor cows. The widespread occurrence of BTB in the study farms and isolation of M. bovis from the milk of reactor cows signify its economic importance and potential risk to public health. Generalization and improved use of milk pasteurization within all dairy subsectors is recommended. and this would affect the competitiveness of the dairy sector in Ethiopia.,True,96-3Bu8AAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC,0,https://www.jarvm.com/articles/Vol1Iss4/Tibbo.htm,,,,https://www.jarvm.com/articles/Vol1Iss4/Tibbo.htm,0,0,0

Ancak uzun zincirli yağ asitleri açil karnitinler oluşturmadan mitokondri içine taşınamazlar ve okside olamazlar. Açil karnitinin içeri taşınması ile bir molekül karnitinin translokasyonu aynı anda gerçekleşmektedir. Açil karnitin daha sonra CoA ile reaksiyona girerek mitokondriyal matriksde Açil-CoA oluşur ve β-oksidasyonuna bu şekilde katılır [1-2].Bu çalışmada L-karnitinin antioksidan ve antiradikal aktiviteleri araştırıldı.

Typographically the book is still untidy and. although some errors have been eliminated. a number of mathematical symbols now appear upside down despite their more conventional presentation in the first edition. Similar carelessness extends to the bibliography. in which entries do not invariably appear in correct alphabetical sequence. Furthermore. the authors cite several important papers of which no trace can be found in the bibliography. The content of the text has been changed little and the challenging statement"" both's' and'n'should be neither odd nor even"" is retained. Short sections have been added on the joint scaling test and the triple test cross. A generalized method for estimating mean squares in line X tester analyses is included. Explanatory footnotes have been added in certain places. especially in the expanded section on the analysis of pooled data. In general. neither statistical rationale nor the assumptions inherent in different methods are discussed.

It is the least mobile element in plant and soil contrary to other macronutrients. It precipitates in soil as orthophosphate or is absorbed by Fe and Al oxides through legend exchange. Phosphorus solubilizing bacteria play role in phosphorus nutrition by enhancing its availability to plants through release from inorganic and organic soil P pools by solubilization and mineralization. Principal mechanism in soil for mineral phosphate solubilization is lowering of soil pH by microbial production of organic acids and mineralization of organic P by acid Phosphatase. Use of phosphorus solubilizing bacteria as inoculants increases P uptake. These bacteria also increase prospects of using phosphatic rocks in crop production. Greater efficiency of P solubilizing bacteria has been shown through co-inoculation with other beneficial bacteria and mycorrhiza.

Besides being the major causative agent for recurrent urinary tract infections. E. coli biofilm is also responsible for indwelling medical device‐related infectivity. The cell‐to‐cell communication within the biofilm occurs due to quorum sensors that can modulate the key biochemical players enabling the bacteria to proliferate and intensify the resultant infections.

Ltd.,The cytoprotective and immunomodulating properties of Emblica ofﬁcinalis (Amla) against chromium (VI) induced oxidative damage are reported. Chromium (VI) at 1 µg/mL concentration was highly cytotoxic. It enhanced free radical production and decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in macrophages. The presence of Amla resulted in an enhanced cell survival. decreased free radical production and higher antioxidant levels similar to that of control cells. Further. chromium (VI) treatment resulted in decreased phagocytosis and gamma‐interferon (γ‐IFN) production while Amla inhibited chromium induced immunosuppression and restored both phagocytosis and γ‐IFN production by macrophages signiﬁcantly.

In April 2003. the Immigration Nationality Directorate (IND) raised the age at which a person could sponsor a partner to enter the UK for marriage from 16 to 18 years. In December 2004. as part of crossgovernmental measures to tackle forced marriage. the age of spouses seeking entry to the UK was also increased to 18 years.

It is not known how the concentration of active sigma 32 is modulated. We showed that rpoH transcript levels increased after heat shock and that the magnitude of the increase in the level of mRNA was correlated with the magnitude of the temperature shift. The increase in the level of rpoH mRNA was still found in rpoH mutants so the mechanism of induction differed from that of the set of previously identified heat shock genes. The increased concentration of rpoH mRNA should result in a higher level of sigma 32. which is likely to be important for increasing heat shock gene transcription.,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:YPNY0knpFBYC,73,https://jb.asm.org/content/168/3/1155.short,18399433770154258408,/scholar?cites=18399433770154258408,,https://jb.asm.org/content/jb/168/3/1155.full.pdf,0,0,0

Children differ in manual dexterity and their grip on toothbrushes. We videotaped toothbrushing sessions and observed the grip type. duration of brushing. and brushing technique used among 100 children aged 8-12 years. We then investigated the association between grip type and plaque removal. using plaque scores obtained at various time points. We further examined the effect on plaque scores of standardizing both brushing technique and duration among the same participants. The most common grip was the distal oblique. followed by the oblique; the spoon and precision grips were rare. and no child used a power grip. Mean brushing duration for most children was 1.43±0.85 min. and the most common brushing technique was horizontal scrubbing. We conclude that grip preference is inherent and that the distal oblique grip was better than the oblique grip in removing plaque.(J Oral Sci 54. 183-190. 2012),True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:0aBXIfxlw9sC,59,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/josnusd/54/2/54_183/_article/-char/ja/,355001384698631503,/scholar?cites=355001384698631503,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/josnusd/54/2/54_183/_pdf,0,0,0

This study suggests a novel AIS predisposition candidate gene and supports the hypothesis that somatosensory functional disorders could contribute to the pathogenesis of AIS. These findings warrant replication in other populations.   Methodology/Principal Findings First. we conducted a case-control study consisting of 953 Chinese Han individuals from southern China (513 patients and 440 healthy controls). and the three SNPs were all found to be associated with AIS predisposition. The ORs were observed as 1.49 (95% CI 1.23–1.80. P = 5.09E-5). 1.70 (95% CI 1.42–2.04. P = 1.17E-8) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.27–1.83. P = 5.54E-6) for rs625039. rs11190870 and rs11598564. respectively. Second. a case-only study including a subgroup of AIS patients (N = 234) was performed to determine the effects of these variants on the severity of the condition. However. we did not find any association between these variants and the severity of curvature.   Conclusion This study shows that the genetic variants near the LBX1 gene are associated with AIS susceptibility in Chinese Han population. It successfully replicates the results of the GWAS. which was performed in a Japanese population.,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C,52,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053234,12094069299681110049,/scholar?cites=12094069299681110049,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053234,0,0,0

The reaction patterns of CSP44 and VL404 against Indian races 12. 77. 77-1. 77-2. 77-3. 77-4. 77-5 and 108 were different from reaction patterns shown by near-isogenic lines with known adult plant resistance (APR) genes. viz.

The cause of thrombosis in these patients remains unclear. We studied the frequency of mutations in genes for coagulation factors V and II (prothrombin) in 61 Indian patients with PVT and 49 healthy control subjects. Methods: The presence of factor V Leiden mutation and of G20210A prothrombin gene mutation was determined using polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Chi-squared test was used to compare patients and controls. Results: Of the 61 patients (median age 11 years; 47 male) studied. 49 were children. One of 61 (1.6%) patients with PVT was heterozygous for factor V Leiden mutation and none had the G20210 prothrombin gene mutation. The frequencies of these mutations were not different from those in control subjects (2/49 and 0/46. respectively). Conclusion: Factor V Leiden and G20210 prothrombin gene mutations are infrequent in Indian patients with PVT.

It is essential for all living beings to change to survive in the ever changing environment. Change represents the struggle between ‘what is’ and ‘what is desired’. In fact. it is a complex process that requires thorough strategic planning in order to achieve the goals of the desired change. As per Fullan (2001).“change is a doubleedged sword. Its relentless pace these days runs us off our feet. Yet when things are unsettled. we can find new ways to move ahead and to create breakthroughs not possible in stagnant societies”.In this era of globalization. with fast changing technology. instant communication and changing social. economic. political and legal aspects. the environment has become increasingly complex. unpredictable and dynamic. The organizations are faced with unprecedented competition and also customers have become highly conscious and demanding. The organizational alliances and structures are rapidly shifting and the strongly held values. beliefs and assumptions are being challenged.

It is the only mode of communication for such people to convey their messages and it becomes very important for people to understand their language. This paper proposes the method or algorithm for an application which would help in recognising the different signs which is called Indian Sign Language. The images are of the palm side of right and left hand and are loaded at runtime. The method has been developed with respect to single user. The real time images will be captured first and then stored in directory and on recently captured image and feature extraction will take place to identify which sign has been articulated by the user through SIFT (scale invariance Fourier transform) algorithm. The comparisons will be performed in arrears and then after comparison the result will be produced in accordance through matched keypoints from the input image to the image stored for a specific letter already in the directory or the database the outputs for the following can be seen in below sections. There are 26 signs in Indian Sign Language corresponding to each alphabet out which the proposed algorithm provided with 95% accurate results for 9 alphabets with their images captured at every possible angle and distance ie for every alphabet even if have approximately 5 images at different angles and distances then the algorithm is working accurately for 45 types of inputs.,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC,43,https://www.academia.edu/download/32139152/IJERT-Sign_language_Recognition_System.pdf,7210941094977580266,/scholar?cites=7210941094977580266,,https://www.academia.edu/download/32139152/IJERT-Sign_language_Recognition_System.pdf,0,0,0

What is meant by entrepreneurship. innovation. and economic growth is often not clear or is very idiosyncratic. This chapter starts with a discussion of the nature of entrepreneurship and its relation to innovation. The second section provides an overview of theory and empirical research on the relation between entrepreneurship. innovation. and economic growth. The chapter continues with a study on entrepreneurship and innovation in the Netherlands from an international and historical perspective. After these conceptual. theoretical. and empirical investigations. we turn to policy issues.5.1. 1 entrepreneurship definedWhat is meant with entrepreneurship and how does this relate to innovation? Entrepreneurship and innovation are fuzzy concepts that have been given multiple meanings. Innovation and entrepreneurship are often regarded as overlapping concepts. This can be traced back to probably the most well known definition of entrepreneurship. by Schumpeter (1934: 74). who defines entrepreneurs as individuals that carry out new combinations (ie. innovations). Schumpeter distinguishes four roles in the process of innovation: the inventor. who invents a new idea; the entrepreneur who commercialises this new idea; the capitalist. who provides the financial resources to the entrepreneur (and bears the risk of the innovation project); the manager. who takes care of the routine day-to-day corporate management.

It is assumed that this population and its resource are affected simultaneously by a toxicant (pollutant) emitted into the environment from external sources as well as formed by precursors of this population. It is shown that as the cumulative rates of emission and formation of the toxicant into the environment increase. the densities of population and its resource settle down to lower equilibria than their initial carrying capacities. and their magnitudes decrease as rates of emission and formation of the toxicant increase. On comparing different cases. it is noted that when population is not affected directly by the toxicant but only its resource is affected. the possibility of its survival is greater than the case when both are affected simultaneously.

106114,A review on endangered medicinal plants of India and their conservation,2014,S Sharma and R Thokchom,10,J Crop Weed,2,205-218,,India has a very rich plant biodiversity. many of which are medicinally useful. The rich resource is disappearing at an alarming rate as a result of over-exploitation. Therefore. the management of traditional medicinal plant resources has become a matter of urgency. An ever increasing demand of uniform medicinal plants based medicines warrants their mass propagation through plant tissue culture strategy. Tissue culture technology is potent and has opened extensive areas of research for biodiversity conservation. Plant in vitro regeneration is a biotechnological tool that offers a tremendous potential solution for the propagation of endangered and superior genotypes of medicinal plants which could be released to their natural habitat or cultivated on a large scale for the pharmaceutical product of interest. Tissue culture protocols have been developed for a wide range of medicinal plants. which includes endangered. rare and threatened plant species. Some of these endangered medicinal plants are Saussaurea lappa. Picorrhiza kurroa. Ginkgo biloba. Swertia chirata. Gymnema sylvestre. Tinospora cordifolia. Salaca oblonga. Holostemma.

Increasing evidence in the last decade implicates quadruplexes in important processes such as transcription and replication. Interestingly. more recent work suggests roles for quadruplexes. in association with quadruplex-interacting proteins. in epigenetics through both DNA and histone modifications. Here. we review the effect of the quadruplex structure on post-replication epigenetic memory and quadruplex-induced promoter DNA/histone modifications. Furthermore. we highlight the epigenetic state of the telomerase promoter where quadruplexes could play a key regulatory role.

One essential pre-requisite for TILLING is genomic DNA isolation from a large population for PCR amplification of selected target genes. It also requires multiplexing of genomic DNA isolated from different individuals (pooling) in typically 8-fold pools. for mutation scanning. and to minimize the number of PCR amplifications. which is a strenuous and long-drawn-out work. We describe here a simplified procedure of multiplexing. NEATTILL (Nucleic acid Extraction from Arrayed Tissue for TILLING). which is rapid and equally efficient in assisting mutation detection. The NEATTILL procedure was evaluated for the tomato TILLING platform and was found to be simpler and more efficient than previously available methods. The procedure consisted of pooling tissue samples. instead of nucleic acid. from individual plants in 96-well plates. followed by DNA isolation from the arrayed samples by a novel protocol. The three variants of the NEATTILL procedure (vast. in-depth and intermediate) can be applied across various genomes depending upon the population size of the TILLING platform.

Prokaryotic signal peptidases are indispensable enzymes required for the removal of N-terminal signal peptide from the secretory proteins. Eukaryotic signal peptidases exist as multimeric protein complex in the ER and the catalytic subunit of this complex catalyzes removal of the N-terminal signal peptide from preproteins. All the signal peptidases contain five regions of high-sequence similarity referred to as boxes A–E. Here we report characterization of the catalytic subunit of signal peptidase complex (SPC) from P. falciparum.

We took a series of case-control studies. trying to understand whether Leptin gene polymorphisms are involved in the etiology of the AIS or the change in leptin level is a secondary event. to assess the level of leptin receptor. and to evaluate the differences of response to leptin between AIS cases and controls. We screened all exons of Leptin gene in 45 cases and 45 controls and selected six tag SNPs to cover all the observed variations. Association analysis in 446 AIS patients and 550 healthy controls showed no association between the polymorphisms of Leptin gene and susceptibility/severity to AIS. Moreover. adipogenesis assay of bone mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) suggested that the adipogenic ability of MSCs from AIS girls was lower than controls. After adjusting the differentiation rate. expressions of leptin and leptin receptor were similar between two groups. Meanwhile. osteogenesis assay of MSC showed the leptin level was similar after adjusting the differentiation rate. but the leptin receptor level was decreased in induced AIS osteoblasts. Immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis showed less leptin receptors expressed in AIS group. Furthermore. factorial designed studies with adipogenesis and osteogenesis revealed that the MSCs from patients have no response to leptin treatment.

However. the internal milieu is disturbed by external factors that lead to imbalance of the inner homeostasis. The host is equipped with multiple tools to abolish external challenges like tissue injury and infection by activation of various defense mechanisms; however. mobilization of all these responses is associated with alterations of the homeostatic status. The multifaceted immune and metabolic responses of the host to external challenges are commonly referred to as the acute-phase response (APR)(Kushner. 1982; Koj. 1985; Baumann & Gauldie. 1994; Moshage. 1997; Mackiewicz. 1997). The aim of the APR is to eliminate the agent (s) that caused the interference and to bring the homeostasis back to normality (Figure 1). The APR is initiated in response to a variety of stimuli including acute trauma. bacterial infection. surgery. fracture. burns. tissue necrosis. presence of a chronic disease. or ongoing inflammatory processes (Kushner. 1982; Gordon & Koj. 1985; Baumann & Gauldie. 1994; Steel & Whitehead. 1994; Boosalis et al.. 1996; Mackiewicz. 1997). The APR usually resolves within a few days or weeks. however sometimes it can persist when the causal agent is defiant (Boosalis et al.. 1996; Mackiewicz. 1997; Koj. 1998).The APR is regulated by numerous compounds referred to as cytokines (Mackiewicz. 1997; Koj. 1998; Martin et al.. 1999).

106159,Where Do We Go From Here? Viewing Corporate Social Responsibility through a Sustainability Lens.,2012,Surya Kant Sharma and Sunita Mehta,6,Journal of Contemporary Management Research,2,,,Over a period of time organizations have realized that the wealth created by them is done by utilizing the resources of the society and in return it becomes imperative for them to return some of the profits back to the society. For a variety of reasons. organizations have been taking many initiatives such as donating money to disaster victims. building hospitals. working for illiteracy etc. However an important question that crops up is whether these initiatives come under the domain of Corporate Social Responsibility. or does it amount to mere corporate philanthropy? Philanthropy activities do not have a long term focus and do not contribute to sustainability and they also do not look into the social. ethical and environmental issues. Another issue that emerges is the fact that businesses across the world are so obsessed with the immediacy of results that they cannot sight the vast opportunity that discharging of social responsibility holds for the long term sustainability for them.In this paper the authors address important aspects of a firm's business activities which can have an effect on areas such health and safety. environmental protection. human rights. stakeholder rights etc which come under the purview of CSR. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the importance of CSR to the business strategy of an organization in ensuring sustainability of business. The paper also brings out the fact that CSR needs to be implemented in the organizations not just as an image building exercise. but can be a source of competitive advantage to ensure sustainable business development.

This can be particularly significant in areas of high clinical acuity such as intensive care. Ward rounds are points where large amounts of information must be communicated in a time-limited environment with many competing interests. This has the potential to reduce effective communication and risk patient safety. Checklists have been used in many industries to improve communication and mitigate risk. We describe the introduction of a ward round safety checklist ‘DEFAULT’ on a paediatric intensive care unit. A non-blinded. pre- and post-intervention observational study was undertaken in a 12-bedded Level 3 tertiary PICU between July 2009 and December 2011. Ward round stakeholders subjectively liked the checklist and felt it improved communication. Introduction of the ward round checklist was associated with an increase in median days between accidental extubations from 14 (range 2 to 86) to 150 (56 to 365) (Mann–Whitney P <0.0001). The ward round checklist was also associated with an increase in the proportion of invasively ventilated patients with target tidal volumes of <8 ml/kg. which increased from 35 of 71 patients at 08.00 representing a proportion of 0.49 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.60) to 23 of 38 (0.61. 0.45 to 0.74).

106178,Biomass conversion technologies for renewable energy and fuels: A review note,2014,Sumit Sharma and Rajendra Meena and Amit Sharma and P Goyal,11,IOSR J. Mech. Civ. Eng,2,28-35,,The world’s energy markets rely heavily on the fossil fuels coal. petroleum crude oil. and natural gas as sources of thermal energy; gaseous. liquid. and solid fuels; and chemicals. Since millions of years are required to form fossil fuels in the earth. their reserves are finite and subject to depletion as they are consumed. The only natural. renewable carbon resource known that is large enough to be used as a substitute for fossil fuels is biomass. This article gives an overview of the state-of-the-art of key biomass conversion technologies currently deployed and technologies that may play a key role in the future. including possible linkage to CO2 capture and sequestration technology (CCS). In doing so. special attention is paid to production of biofuels for the transport sector. because this is likely to become the key emerging market for large-scale sustainable biomass use. A range from 200 to 300 EJ may be observed looking well into this century. making biomass a more important energy supply option than mineral oil today. A key issue for bio-energy is that its use should be modernized to fit into a sustainable development path. Especially promising are the production of electricity via advanced conversion concepts (ie gasification and state-of-the-art combustion and co-firing) and modern biomass derived fuels like methanol. hydrogen and ethanol from ligno-cellulosic biomass. which can reach competitive cost levels within 1–2 decades (partly depending on price developments with petroleum). The gasification route offers special possibilities to combine this with low cost CO2 capture (and storage). resulting in concepts that are both flexible with …,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:CmbFvBriOyMC,21,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sumit_Sharma18/publication/274126129_Biomass_Conversion_Technologies_for_Renewable_Energy_and_Fuels_A_Review_Note/links/5cc08888299bf120977d6076/Biomass-Conversion-Technologies-for-Renewable-Energy-and-Fuels-A-Review-Note.pdf,14923530956692830161,/scholar?cites=14923530956692830161,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sumit_Sharma18/publication/274126129_Biomass_Conversion_Technologies_for_Renewable_Energy_and_Fuels_A_Review_Note/links/5cc08888299bf120977d6076/Biomass-Conversion-Technologies-for-Renewable-Energy-and-Fuels-A-Review-Note.pdf,0,0,0

Viscosity is one of the important properties of an oil which needs to be determined as it influences the ease of handling. transport and nature of storage. The effect of temperature on viscosity of six refined vegetable oils viz. palm oil. rice bran oil. cottonseed oil. mustard oil. sunflower oil and soybean oil has been studied. An empirical correlation between reduced viscosity and reduced temperature has been derived for the determination of viscosities of refined vegetable oils showing Arrhenius behaviour above 20°C (293 K). This correlation predicts the viscosity of refined vegetable oils at temperatures more than 40-60°C above 20°C (293 K). Consistency tests for viscosity data using reduced parameters have been reported.

However. mounting evidence shows non-telomeric binding and gene regulation by shelterin factors. This raises a key question—do telomeres impact binding of shelterin proteins at distal non-telomeric sites? Here we show that binding of the telomere-repeat-binding-factor-2 (TRF2) at promoters ~60 Mb from telomeres depends on telomere length in human cells. Promoter TRF2 occupancy was depleted in cells with elongated telomeres resulting in altered TRF2-mediated transcription of distal genes. In addition. histone modifications—activation (H3K4me1 and H3K4me3) as well as silencing marks (H3K27me3)—at distal promoters were telomere length-dependent. These demonstrate that transcription. and the epigenetic state. of telomere-distal promoters can be influenced by telomere length. Molecular links between telomeres and the extra-telomeric genome. emerging from findings here. might have important implications in telomere-related physiology. particularly ageing and cancer.,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:V_vSwabWVtYC,19,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007782,16791366089098102341,/scholar?cites=16791366089098102341,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007782,0,0,0

In the samples so prepared. the synergetic combination of ultra low thermal conductivity (∼0.7 W/m K). high Seebeck coefficient (∼−168 μV/K). and low electrical resistivity (∼15 μΩ-m) has been observed to successfully lead to a high figure-of-merit (ZT) of ∼0.96 at 370 K. A detailed characterization of the samples reveals a presence of multiscale hierarchical defect structures i.e. atomic scale disorder arising from a multitude of factors such as large anharmonicity of Bi-Se bond due to electrostatic repulsion between the lone pair of Bi and charge of Se. nanoscale grains and dislocations trapped between mesoscale grains/grain boundaries accompanied by intrinsic layered structure of Bi2Se3.

BK virus reactivation in kidney transplant recipients can result in BK virus nephropathy and graft loss. The most effective strategy for early diagnosis and treatment of BK virus nephropathy is regular monitoring for BK virus. currently achieved by quantification of viral DNA in blood by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Immunosuppression reduction remains the mainstay of treatment; however. viral clearance is often followed by acute rejection. likely secondary to a delay between immune reconstitution and viral clearance. Impaired cell-mediated immune response to BK virus has been shown to correlate with progression to BK virus nephropathy. while reconstitution of this response correlates with resolution of nephropathy. There is recent research to support monitoring BK virus-specific cell-mediated immune response as a predictor of disease progression and resolution.

106221,Isolation and characterization of type I signal peptidase of different malaria parasites,2005,Sutikshan Sharma and Arun Pradhan and Virander S Chauhan and Renu Tuteja,2005,Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology,4,301-309,Hindawi,Type I signal peptidases are important membrane-bound serine proteases responsible for the cleavage of the signal peptide of the proteins. These enzymes are unique serine proteases that carry out catalysis using a serine/lysine catalytic dyad. In the present study. we report the isolation of type I signal peptidase from the malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum. Plasmodium knowlesi. and Plasmodium yoelii and some characterization of type I signal peptidase of Plasmodium falciparum. We show that these enzymes are homologous to signal peptidases from various sources and also contain the conserved boxes present in other type I signal peptidases. The type I signal peptidase from P falciparum is an intron-less and a single-copy gene. The results also show that the enzyme from Plasmodium falciparum is subject to self-cleavage and it has been demonstrated to possess type I signal peptidase activity in E coli preprotein processing in vivo by complementation assay. This study will be helpful in understanding one of the important metabolic pathways “the secretory pathway” in the parasite and should make an important contribution in understanding the complex process of protein targeting in the parasite.,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:Lbh3VFZM3akC,17,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2005/808623/abs/,9579693211492444641,/scholar?cites=9579693211492444641,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2005/808623.pdf,0,0,0

The two terrestrial reed ecotypes. DR and HSR. exhibited a higher capacity for osmotic adjustment; they accumulated higher contents of K+ and Ca2+ in the leaves in comparison with SR. DR also had the highest soluble sugar content in its leaves. HSR has higher levels of Na+ in its root environment and this was reflected by considerable accumulation of Na+ in the HSR rhizome. However. the different zones of its leaf lamina (upper. middle and lower) did not exhibit increased levels of Na+. suggesting that HSR has the ability to accumulate Na+ in the rhizome to protect the shoots from excessive Na+ toxicity.

106245,Implementation Of ROCK Clustering Algorithm For The Optimization Of Query Searching Time,2012,Ashwina Tyagi and Sheetal Sharma,4,International Journal on Computer Science and Engineering,5,809,Engg Journals Publications,Clustering is a data mining technique of grouping similar type of data or queries together which helps in identifying similar subject areas. The major problem is to identify heterogeneous subject areas where frequent queries are asked. There are number of agglomerative clustering algorithms which are used to cluster the data. The problem with these algorithms is that they make use of distance measures to calculate similarity. So the best suited algorithm for clustering the categorical data is Robust Clustering Using Links (ROCK)[1] algorithm because it uses Jaccard coefficient instead of using the distance measures to find the similarity between the data or documents to classify the clusters. The mechanism for classifying the clusters based on the similarity measure shall be used over a given set of data. This method will make clusters of the data corresponding to different subject areas so that a prior knowledge about similarity can be maintained which in turn will help to discover accurate and consistent clusters and will reduce the query response time. The main objective of our work is to implement ROCK [1] and to decrease the query response time by searching the documents in the resulted clusters instead of searching the whole database. This technique actually reduces the searching time of documents from the database.,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:jSAVyFp_754C,15,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.434.5317&rep=rep1&type=pdf,653712814654329988,/scholar?cites=653712814654329988,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.434.5317&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

106263,Performance and emission analysis of diesel engine using biodiesel and preheated jatropha oil,2014,Saurabh Sharma and Rohit Singh and Mayank Mishra and Gaurav Kumar Mitra and Rakesh Kumar Gangwar,2,Int J Curr Res Acad Rev,6,229-239,,Today in this fast developing World the need of various transportation system is increasing day by day. in the result of this Number of vehicles and engine are increasing. but the conventional fuel used in the vehicles (like diesel and petrol) are limited and decreasing gradually with time. So there is a requirement of various means to drive these vehicles without a heavy modification in the engine of these vehicles. This situation leads to requirement of alternative fuels for engines. Biodiesel is the best substitute of the Diesel in the Diesel Engine (1). Vegetables oil is the best alternative fuel. The main advantage of vegetable oil over the conventional fuel (as diesel in the diesel engine) is of reducing the cost and able to reduce net CO2 and CO emissions to atmosphere due to their agricultural origin (2). In this paper we investigate the prospective of Jatropha oil to use as a Bio-fuel in the conventional diesel engine. Jatropha oil is derived from Jatropha curcas plant which has been considered as a sustainable alternate fuel for diesel engine and also Jatropha curcas plant is renewable and non edible (3). However several durable and operational problems of using straight vegetable oils in the diesel engine are reported in literature. due to their higher viscosity and low volatility as compare to mineral diesel fuel (4). Hence vegetable oil does not give the better performance without proper modification. In this experimental work. performance of diesel engine operating on preheated Jatropha oil was evaluated and compared with diesel operation. The performance parameter considered for comparing is brake specific fuel consumption. thermal efficiency …,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:7rVtnTjEZJgC,14,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.447.8568&rep=rep1&type=pdf,14314545809696751263,/scholar?cites=14314545809696751263,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.447.8568&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

At the beginning. there was no money and people were engaged in barter in which there was exchange of merchandise for merchandise without value equivalence. This elementary form of trade prevailed at the beginning of civilization and is found even today among people of primitive economies. especially in regions where difficult access makes money scarce. This exchange. however. is not free from difficulties. since there is no common measure of value among the items bartered. At some point in the development of ancient societies people began to recognize that simple bartering can be cumbersome and slow. This led to the acceptance of commodity money. Many items. which were thought of having value were used ascommodity money. These included many objects such as naturally scarce precious metals. conch shells. beads. etc. However. with the growth of society towards commercialization. the society as well as economy shifted to metallic money. At this stage. coins of various metals such as gold. silver and copper were designated as money. Later. during 17th and 18th century. paper money (note) was introduced. which has now become the most popular …,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C,13,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arvind_Singh56/post/Does_you_know_the_Microbiology_of_currency_notes/attachment/5b90cb29cfe4a76455f1133f/AS%3A667751823724557%401536215849903/download/6.pdf,16880085421432010591,/scholar?cites=16880085421432010591,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arvind_Singh56/post/Does_you_know_the_Microbiology_of_currency_notes/attachment/5b90cb29cfe4a76455f1133f/AS%3A667751823724557%401536215849903/download/6.pdf,0,0,0

This is a time when temperature starts increasing to between 30 C and 40 C in the month of June followed by rains in July and August. The high temperature and humid conditions during this time favour dry rot and other types of rots of potatoes stored in heaps and country stores. This can lead to huge losses. Therefore. it becomes essential to store potatoes in cold stores for about five to six months. Nevertheless. the potatoes may still develop dry or soft rots if they have been mechanically damaged during a period of high temperatures.During October 2009. dry rot disease was observed on potato tubers of cv.'Kufri Ashoka'in cold stores at Sehore district of Madhya Pradesh. When removed after six months of storage. more than 90% of tubers were affected by dry rot. Also. in October 2010 similar symptoms were observed in about 1-2% of potato tubers of cv.'Kufri Bahar'stored in cold stores at Shahbad in Haryana. The tubers were shrivelled. mummified and hard (Fig. 1). Isolations on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium from infected tubers from both locations consistently yielded rapidly growing floccose to felt-like colonies. initially white but turning peach to orange later (Fig. 2). Conidia were abundant. 3-5 septate with apical cell pointed and basal cell foot shaped (Fig. 3). The fungus was grown on PDA at 18±1 C for about 14 days prior to inoculation.

The analysis is based on the evaluation of the ratio of effective channel length to natural/characteristic length. Our results show that for this ratio to be greater than 2. steeper source/drain doping gradients along with wider source/drain roll-off widths will be required for both devices. In order to enhance short channel immunity. the ratio of source/drain roll-off width to lateral straggle should be greater than 2 for a wide range of source/drain doping gradients.,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:nS6_t4fuB3kC,13,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO200827448608203.page,17271142488407205564,/scholar?cites=17271142488407205564,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO200827448608203.pdf,0,0,0

Airway access has undergone dramatic technological improvements. from heroic tracheotomy reports during diphtheria epidemics to the modern day non-surgically placed endotracheal tubes that allow invasive mechanical ventilation. Indeed. the field of pediatric critical care was founded on the need for prolonged assisted ventilation via an endotracheal tube following surgery. Prolonged hand ventilation quickly gave way to rapid developments in the types and modes of mechanical ventilation. which continues to this day. Throughout. the endotracheal tube (ETT) has remained our fundamental tool to facilitate prolonged mechanical ventilation.

RESULTS: During the study period. there were 13. 9117 births and 504 complete moles. 12 partial moles. 48 persistent gestational tumours. six choriocarcinoma and four invasive moles recorded in the hospital. The incidence of complete mole was one per 276 births. It was prevalent among women younger than 29 years (80%) and among the primigravidae (36.7%). More than 90% women presented in the first half of their pregnancy and vaginal bleeding was the main complaint (68.3%). Suction evacuation. dilation and evacuation followed by sharp curettage and abdominal hysterectomy were performed in 80.6%. 17.6% and 1.2% of the women respectively. Persistent mole and choriocarcinoma developed in 9.5% and 0.4% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Complete mole has the highest incidence. It affects mostly younger women and presents with vaginal bleeding most of the time. usually in the first half of their pregnancy.,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:I__7AI8a974C,11,https://europepmc.org/article/med/21180213,1357461875788074640,/scholar?cites=1357461875788074640,,,0,0,0
106342,Current understanding of genetic factors in idiopathic scoliosis,2010,Carol A Wise and Swarkar Sharma,,,,167-190,Springer. New York. NY,“Scoliosis” is derived from the Greek word meaning “crooked” and was used for the first time by Galen (AD 131–201) to describe an “S-shaped” or “C-shaped” spinal deformity (Fig. 9.1). Although defined as a lateral curvature as visualized by plane radiography. the deformity is actually three-dimensional and involves changes in the frontal. sagittal. and transverse planes of the spinal column. Patients treated for scoliosis generally belong to one of the three categories. In so-called congenital scoliosis. the structural curvature of the spine is clearly secondary to radiographically visible vertebral malformations and is typically obvious at an early age. Other patients may have scoliosis as part of other pathological conditions.,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C,11,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-1406-4_9,2071959306042077059,/scholar?cites=2071959306042077059,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rocky_Tuan/publication/226663308_Environmental_Factors_and_Axial_Skeletal_Dysmorphogenesis/links/54a97ee50cf2eecc56e6c437.pdf#page=176,0,0,0

A design methodology. by evaluatingm the ratio of the effective channel length to the natural length for the different devices (single or double gate FETs) and technology (SOI or GOI). is proposed to minimize short channel effects (SCEs). The optimization of non-overlapped gate-source/drain ie underlap channel architecture is extremely useful to limit the degradation in SCEs caused by the high permittivity channel materials like Germanium as compared to that exhibited in Silicon based devices. Subthreshold slope and Drain Induced Barrier Lowering results show that steeper S/D gradients along with wider spacer regions are needed to suppress SCEs in GOI single/double gate devices as compared to Silicon based MOSFETs. A design criterion is developed to evaluate the minimum spacer width associated with underlap channel design to limit SCEs in SOI/GOI MOSFETs.,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:ChsjQIg5EFEC,11,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO200934939519727.page,5502783661686514297,/scholar?cites=5502783661686514297,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO200934939519727.pdf,0,0,0

This group is delineated into Q1. Q2 and Q3 subgroups defined by biallelic markers M120. M25/M143 and M3. respectively. Recently. a novel subgroup Q4 has been identified which is defined by bi-allelic marker M346. representing HG Q (0.41%. 3/728) in Indian population. With scanty details of HG Q in Asia. especially India. it was pertinent to explore the status of the Y-HG Q in Indian population to gather an insight to determine the extent of diversity within this region. We observed 15/630 (2.38%) Y-HG Q individuals in India with an ancestral state at M120. M25. M3 and M346 markers. indicating an absence of already known Q1. Q2. Q3 and Q4 sub-haplogroups.

106363,Risk assessment: A case study for transportation projects in India,2014,TH Nguyen and G Bhagavatulya and F Jacobs,3,International Journal of Application or Innovation in Engineering & Management (IJAIEM),9,,,The construction industry in India is estimated to be worth $120 billion per year. The sector caters to the needs of over a billion people and contributes 5.5% to the nation’s GDP. However. this industry continues to face challenges around skill shortage. rise in material and labor costs. and socioeconomic changes. The primary intent of this research study is to focus on the India construction transportation sector with an emphasis on multiple project risk factors. A data collection questionnaire was administered to Indian construction companies with a 66% response rate. Respondents were asked to rate among 30 identified industry risk factors. Three tests were performed to assess the data’s reliability. correlation between the variables. and relative importance of risk factors among each other. The study results indicated that several of the risks highlighted have a high impact even if the probability of occurrence is low. It is also understood that project management teams are not effective in terms of communication with project stakeholders. and are incapable of formulating the correct strategies when projects are not in good health.

The Moyers mixed dentition space analysis is the non-radiographic method for detecting tooth-size arch length discrepancies. Moyers analysis was developed for North American children. Anthropological studies reveal that tooth size varies among different races and ethnicities. The present study was aimed to determine the applicability of Moyers mixed dentition arch analysis in children of Baddi. Himachal Pradesh. Dental study models of 120 children in age group of 13-16 years. were analysed who presented with complete eruption of permanent mandibular incisors. maxillary and mandibular canines & premolars. All dentitions were required to be free of any signs of dental pathology or anomalies. Measurements of the mesiodistal dimensions of the mandibular and maxillary teeth were made using a digital caliper with a Vernier scale that was calibrated to the nearest 0.01 mm. The values were then subjected to statistical analysis. All tooth groups showed highly significant differences (p< 0.001) between mesiodistal widths in male and female subjects. Significant differences (p< 0.05) were found between actual widths and the Moyers tables at almost all percentile levels. including the recommended 75%.

Metal machining has been a very significant activity in manufacturing. Surface quality is one of the most common concern is to satisfy customer needs in which the major indication of surface quality on machined parts is surface roughness. It has long been recognized that the machining conditions. such as cutting speed. feed and depth of cut affect the performance of the operation to a high extent. Surface roughness and material removal rate should be taken into consideration. This can be achieved using design of experiments (DOE). It is used in the manufacturing industries for making die casting moulds. extrusion dies. moulds for glass industry. punches. etc. In the present study the machining experiments were conducted on CNC vertical milling machine whose maximum speed was 6000 RPM. Design of experiments based on Taguchi grey relational analysis with three independent factors (cutting speed. feed rate and depth of cut). three levels L27 orthogonal array has been used to develop relationships for predicting surface roughness and metal removal rate. The surface roughness was measured using surface roughness tester (Mitutoyo surftest-4) and the averages were calculated to obtain the surface roughness of the samples.

Electricity is the form of energy. It is a basic part of nature and one of our most widely used forms of energy. We get electricity.(which is a secondary energy source) from the conversion of other sources of energy. like coal. natural gas. oil. nuclear power and other natural sources. which are called primary sources. Electricity generation was first developed in the 1800's using Faraday’s dynamo generator. Almost 200 years later we are still using the same basic principles to generate electricity. but on a much larger scale. Above mentioned primary energy resources are the conventional and are in limited quantity. and on the other hand create a lot of pollution in atmosphere. a new technique of power generation is introduced here. ie through speed breaker power generators. Generating electricity by speed breakers is an innovative and useful concept. As on speed breakers tremendous amount of energy get wasted by vehicles. to utilize this energy through speed breakers. a lot of models were introduced.

There are two types of EPCs. early EPCs and late EPCs. EPCs are believed to originate from hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells. The mobilization of progenitor cells from bone marrow to the peripheral circulation is highly regulated under both normal physiological conditions and stress. EPCs contribute to neovascularization and tissue repair in the musculoskeletal. neural tissues and the bone which are mobilized and recruited to the injured tissue.

India. to detect the role of neotectonic activity,2013,Sangeeta Sharma and Jogendra Nath Sarma,41,Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing,4,895-904,Springer India,An analysis of the drainage network of a part of Sivasagar district. Assam. India. is undertaken to reveal the role of neotectonic activity of the area. A number of fluvial geomorphic anomalies have been identified in the area. A prominent annular drainage anomaly is displayed by the major rivers—the Dikhu. Jhanzi. Namdang. Dorika and Disang. whose courses are carved in response to the ongoing tectonic deformation in the area. This study reveals that the development of topography and drainage system of the study area have been influenced by active subsurface geological structures. Formation of paleochannels. compressed meanders. reticulate streams. swamps. sagging of grounds. stream alignments. lineaments. knick points and abandonment of rivers as well as development of smaller drainage anomalies also substantiate the active nature of the subsurface structures.,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:VN7nJs4JPk0C,9,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12524-013-0262-7,1454515794731281645,/scholar?cites=1454515794731281645,,,0,0,0

106426,Factor analysis of berry and its seed characteristics in potato,1985,SK Sharma and SK Choudhary,,Genetica Iberica (Spain),,,,Phenotypic correlations in 40 genotypes were used for factor analysis in potato through the principal component method. Three factors were found important in explaining relationship in nine traits. Factor one included berry weight. berry diameter and 1.000-seed weight. which are related to the size or weight of the berry and its seeds. The second factor included berries/bunch. seeds/berry. flowers/berry and berry set. which are essentially related to the number of berries and their seeds. Berries/bunch was also affected by the third factor. Correlation studies and factor analysis provided the complementary ways of studying the data.

Haryana has contributed heavily to the Green Revolution and has been the biggest contributor of food wealth and agricultural consumptions in India. It has third highest per capita income in the country after Goa and Delhi. Haryana is a progressing state economically but on the social front it is still backward and patriarchal. It comprises of 21 Districts at present out of which 19 districts have sex ratio lower than 880. According to Census 2011 it has the worst sex ratio (877) and lowest child sex ratio (830). In the state of Haryana since status of women is low. crimes against women are likely to be higher. The Reflection of patriarchy and its effect on society at large are very evident in our statistics. Moreover. the reported cases are much smaller than the actual number. because brining certain crimes into the notice of authorities will tarnish the image of women who are themselves victims. Thus theme of the present research paper is based on different types of gender crime/violence perpetrated against women in Haryana.The introductory part of the paper throws light on NCRB data on crime against women in Haryana in comparison to India. Second part of the paper will discuss the two types of crimes. one leading to death of a woman and not leading to death of a woman.

106462,Analysis of isoproterenol-induced changes in gastrocnemius muscle and serum lactate dehydrogenase expression in mice,2011,M Kaundal and S Sharma,52,Singapore medical journal,4,274,,Introduction: Beta-adrenergic agonists are highly abused by sportspeople for their muscle anabolic and lipolytic effects. Muscle growth effects are thought to result from beta-2 adrenoceptor activation. This study attempted to characterise muscle (gastrocnemius) tissue damage following the administration of isoproterenol.Methods: Adult male Balb-C mice were treated with a single oral dose of isoproterenol (100 mg/kg body weight) for 4. 8. 20. 48 and 72 hours. Control mice received equal doses of saline. The animals were killed at the respective stages. followed by the collection of gastrocnemius and blood. Serum was then separated from blood. Histopathology and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were performed.Results: Beta-adrenoceptor activation-induced histological changes began with structural aberrations. and ultimately resulted in myonecrosis and extensive degeneration within hours of the administration of isoproterenol. The effects of beta-agonist administration on muscle myofibre organisation were visible within four hours and became most prominent at 20 and 48 hours. Augmentation of more than 20 percent in muscle LDH activity was observed at 4. 8 and 72 hour stages. and was accompanied by a significant decline of 19 and 27 percent at 20 and 48 hour time points. respectively. Serum corroborated the above results.Conclusion: Isoproterenol treatment produced considerable histopathological changes. including myonecrosis in mice gastrocnemius. resulting in a leaky sarcolemma and the release of marker enzyme.

Sci. and Technol,2,,,The purpose of boundary value analysis is to concentrate effort on error prone area by accurately pinpointing the boundaries of condition. Boundary value analysis produces test inputs near each sub domain’s to find failure cause by incorrect implementation of boundary. The major limitation of boundary value analysis is that it fails to test non-numerical variables.

106471,Application of neural networks for protein sequence classification,2004,S Sharma and V Kumar and T Sobha Rani and S Durga Bhavani and S Bapi Raju,,,,325-328,IEEE,Protein sequence classification is modelled as a binary classification problem where an unlabeled protein sequence is checked to see if it belongs to a known set of protein superfamilies or not. In this paper we used multilayer perceptrons with supervised learning algorithm to learn the binary classification. The training data consists of two sets-a positive set belonging to an identified set of protein superfamily and a negative set comprising sequences from other superfamilies. When applying neural networks the first problem to be addressed is feature extraction. In this paper we used the new feature extraction techniques proposed by Wang et al. Simulations reveal that the neural network is able to classify with good precision for myosin and photochrome superfamilies in the data set that we have chosen as positive. Also the results for globin superfamily are good. thus validating the methodology of feature extraction …,True,R9JZ3KoAAAAJ:Gs1AF5H0x94C,8,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1287676/,12313479903373506578,/scholar?cites=12313479903373506578,,,0,0,0

The 28-item questionnaire consisted of questions relating to various issues around emergency contraception in addition to some basic demographic questions.A total of 5.020 questionnaires and Freepost envelopes was distributed to the 53 pharmacies. This paper is based on data collected from 430 returned questionnaires. representing a 9 per cent response rate. The low response rate may be explained by the fact that some pharmacists decided (for reasons of time and motivation) not to distribute questionnaires to all users. The low response rates may compromise the statistical representativeness of the findings and underlines the limitations of requesting pharmacists to administer surveys. However. additional qualitative research (reported on elsewhere) was carried out to validate these findings.
