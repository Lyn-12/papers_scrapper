101734,Mussel-inspired adhesives and coatings,2011,Bruce P Lee and Phillip B Messersmith and Jacob N Israelachvili and J Herbert Waite,41,,,99-132,Annual Reviews,Mussels attach to solid surfaces in the sea. Their adhesion must be rapid. strong. and tough. or else they will be dislodged and dashed to pieces by the next incoming wave. Given the dearth of synthetic adhesives for wet polar surfaces. much effort has been directed to characterizing and mimicking essential features of the adhesive chemistry practiced by mussels. Studies of these organisms have uncovered important adaptive strategies that help to circumvent the high dielectric and solvation properties of water that typically frustrate adhesion. In a chemical vein. the adhesive proteins of mussels are heavily decorated with Dopa. a catecholic functionality. Various synthetic polymers have been functionalized with catechols to provide diverse adhesive. sealant. coating. and anchoring properties. particularly for critical biomedical applications.,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC,1211,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-matsci-062910-100429,15007762249294970097,/scholar?cites=15007762249294970097,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3207216/,0,0,0

The marine mussel serves as an appropriate model to illustrate how Nature designs adhesives to resist the subversive effects of water.

Despite the obvious advantages of reinforcing soft protoplasm with a hard scaffold. such composites can lead to tremendous mechanical stresses where the two meet. Although little is known about how nature relieves these stresses. it is generally agreed that fundamental insights about molecular adaptation at hard/soft interfaces could profoundly influence how we think about biomaterials. Based on two noncellular tissues. mussel byssus and polychaete jaws. recent studies suggest that one natural strategy to minimize interfacial stresses between adjoining stiff and soft tissue appears to be the creation of a “fuzzy” boundary. which avoids abrupt changes in mechanical properties.

Mfp-1 (Mytilus foot protein-1) is a conspicuous component of the protective outer cuticle of byssal threads given its high 3.4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) content at 10-15 mol %.

In marine mussels one such fluid. secreted during the formation of adhesive plaques. consists of a concentrated colloidal suspension of a mussel foot protein (mfp) known as Mfp-3S. The results of this study suggest that Mfp-3S becomes a complex fluid by a liquid–liquid phase separation from equilibrium solution at a pH and ionic strength reminiscent of the conditions created by the mussel foot during plaque formation. The pH dependence of phase separation and its sensitivity indicate that inter-/intra-molecular electrostatic interactions are partially responsible for driving the phase separation. Hydrophobic interactions between the non- polar Mfp-3S proteins provide another important driving force for coacervation.

Up to 70% of the total absorbed energy can be dissipated in the byssus. Because byssal threads attach the mussel to hard inert surfaces in its habitat. they must combine the need to be good shock absorbers with appropriate matching of Young's modulus between living tissue and a hard sub–stratum such as stone—stiffnesses that can differ by five orders of magnitude. Recent data suggest that improved modulus matching and decreased stress concentration between different portions of the byssus is achieved by the use of protein gradients.

To help cope with these stresses. mussels have evolved some extraordinary structural and biochemical adaptations. The production of the byssus is one such adaptation. The byssus is a complex array of threads and adhesive plaques that serves alternatively to attach the mussel to solid objects. to absorb shock. or to scale a vertical face (Waite. 1983 a; Price. 1983). Because of its location outside the animal's living tissues. the byssus cannot count on the same kind of repair and remodelling offered to structures within the animal.

It defines a scleroprotein functionally as a protein contributing mechanical strength to supporting structures in animals. The most persistent properties of the scleroproteins are their insolubility in vitro. and their resistance to proteinases and various hydrolytic solvents. This stability can be attributed to two factors: (1) special arrangement of amino acids and (2) covalent cross-linking of the primary valence chains.

The egg capsule wall of the channelled whelk Busycon canaliculum is an effective shock absorber with high reversible extensibility and a stiffness that changes significantly during extension. Here we show that post-stretch recovery in egg capsules is not driven by entropic forces as it is in rubber. Indeed. at fixed strain. force decreases linearly with increasing temperature. whereas in rubber elasticity the force increases. Instead. capsule wall recovery is associated with the internal energy arising from the facile and reversible structural α-helix-sheet transition of egg capsule proteins during extension.

Periostracin is unusually unstable in vitro. It was extracted with high yield from marginal periostracum with pure formic acid. It is a basic. water-insoluble protein with a molecular weight of 20.000 as determined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The amino acid composition of periostracin is unique with 55% of the residues being glycine. 10% tyrosine and 2.2% Dopa. The presence of Dopa was further substantiated by reaction with ethylenediamine. by difference spectra at various pH and by UV and visible spectra of the oxidation products.

This fibrous. proteinaceous and highly cross-linked structure allows the mussel to attach to a variety of substrata and contributes to its notoriety as a major freshwater biofouling species. We have successfully expressed a full-length version of Dreissena polymorpha foot protein 1 (Dpfp1). a putative byssal thread precursor. and have used the recombinant protein as an antigen for polyclonal antibody production. Antisera obtained from rabbits immunized with recombinant Dpfp1 recognize the protein in western blots of extracts from foot tissue and byssal threads. On the basis of this evidence. we conclude that Dpfp1 is a byssal precursor protein manufactured and stored in the foot of the mussel.

Many prior studies attribute their adhesive strength to the strong chemical interactions between the holdfast and substrate. While chemical interactions are certainly important. adhesive performance is also determined by contact geometry. and understanding the coupling between chemical interactions and the plaque shape and mechanical properties is essential in deploying bioinspired strategies when engineering improved adhesives. To investigate how the shape and mechanical properties of the mussel's plaque contribute to its adhesive performance. we use a custom built load frame capable of fully characterizing the dynamics of the detachment.

Dreissena polymorpha. owes its notoriety as a biofouler to its adhesive skills and opportunism. Adhesion by the adult mussel to hard substrata is mediated by a nonliving extracorporeal structure called the byssus. which is superficially similar to the byssus of marine mussels in that it consists of a tight bundle of sclerotized threads tipped by adhesive plaques. Juvenile zebra mussels secrete a homologous structure on settlement. but they also employ an elongated belaying byssus while climbing that consists of an elastic. mucous filament anchored at irregular intervals by a byssal thread and plaque. This multiply anchored belaying line can be 20 to 30 times the mussel length. Histochemical tests show that the thread and plaque of both kinds of byssus contains a complex distribution of proteins that are subject to chemical processing after secretion.

Emerging mechanistic insights about structure–property relationships in sclerotized extracellular composites include the following: (1) tissue stiffness can be significantly adjusted by the relative organization and density of rigid versus flexible domains in the protein components (mussel byssal thread); (2) structures can be rich in polyphenols without being sclerotized (mussel adhesive plaque); (3) stiffness and hardness can be adjusted by the relative abundance of interactions between protein-based imidazole and catecholate ligands and …,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC,39,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065280610380039,10254207609301877495,/scholar?cites=10254207609301877495,,,0,0,0

Apparently. however. not all mussel adhesive proteins are beholden to Dopa chemistry. The cDNA-deduced sequence of Pvfp-1. a highly aromatic and redox active byssal coating protein in the green mussel Perna viridis. suggests that Dopa may be replaced by a post-translational modification of tryptophan. The N-terminal tryptophan-rich domain of Pvfp-1 contains 42 decapeptide repeats with the consensus sequences ATPKPW1TAW2K and APPPAW1TAW2K. A small collagen domain (18 Gly-X-Y repeats) is also present.

101904,Boronate complex formation with Dopa containing mussel adhesive protein retards pH-induced oxidation and enables adhesion to mica,2014,Yajing Kan and Eric W Danner and Jacob N Israelachvili and Yunfei Chen and J Herbert Waite,9,PLoS One,10,e108869,Public Library of Science,The biochemistry of mussel adhesion has inspired the design of surface primers. adhesives. coatings and gels for technological applications. These mussel-inspired systems often focus on incorporating the amino acid 3.4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (Dopa) or a catecholic analog into a polymer. Unfortunately. effective use of Dopa is compromised by its susceptibility to auto-oxidation at neutral pH. Oxidation can lead to loss of adhesive function and undesired covalent cross-linking. Mussel foot protein 5 (Mfp-5). which contains ∼30 mole % Dopa. is a superb adhesive under reducing conditions but becomes nonadhesive after pH-induced oxidation. Here we report that the bidentate complexation of borate by Dopa to form a catecholato-boronate can be exploited to retard oxidation. Although exposure of Mfp-5 to neutral pH typically oxidizes Dopa. resulting in a>95% decrease in adhesion. inclusion of borate retards oxidation at the same pH. Remarkably. this Dopa-boronate complex dissociates upon contact with mica to allow for a reversible Dopa-mediated adhesion. The borate protection strategy allows for Dopa redox stability and maintained adhesive function in an otherwise oxidizing environment.,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,37,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108869,1455596563909819637,/scholar?cites=1455596563909819637,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108869,0,0,0

101911,Wresting the muscle from mussel beards: research and applications.,1995,Leszek M Rzepecki and J Herbert Waite,4,,4,313-322,,Marine and zebra mussels secrete byssal beards to attach themselves opportunistically to hard surfaces in their environment. By doing this. they naturally earn a reputation as fouling pests. The protein precursors of byssus in mussels are being investigated in the hope not only of discovering specific measures against these marine foulers. but also to gain some insights into the technically challenging task of engineering adhesive bonds underwater. Although byssal proteins are all part of the bearded glue that bonds them to a surface. they can be subdivided into three types depending on the function that they serve in byssal threads:(1) fibrous proteins form the load-bearing cables in the core of the threads.(2) cuticular proteins form a protective coat around the cables. and (3) adhesive proteins connect the cables to a foreign surface. A flaw in any one of these will undermine a mussel's ability to attach. The fibrous proteins can be collagenous. silk-like. elastic. or any combination of these. Covering these are the cuticular proteins. which are distinguished by their surface coupling properties. tandemly repeated primary sequence. and their high content of lysine and the exotic amino acid 3. 4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (DOPA).

Fibers are continuous. separated by matrix. and consist of chimeric collagens that encompass within the same primary protein structure domains corresponding to collagen. polyhistidine. and either elastin or dragline spider silk. The elastic modulus (stiffness) of the proximal portion of byssal threads was measured by cyclic stress-strain analysis at 50% extension. Before measurement. the threads were conditioned by various treatments. particularly agitation in aerated or nitrogen-sparged seawater. Stiffness can be permanently increased by more than two times. e.g.. from 25 MPa to a maximum of 65 MPa. by simple agitation in aerated seawater.

Oxidation of DOPA to Dopaquinone (Q) effectively abolishes the adsorption of Mfps to these surfaces. The thiol-rich mussel foot protein-6 (Mfp-6) rescues adhesion compromised by adventitious DOPA oxidation by reducing Q back to DOPA. The redox chemistry and kinetics of foot-extracted Mfp-6 were investigated by using a nonspecific chromogenic probe to equilibrate with the redox pool. Foot-extracted Mfp-6 has a reducing capacity of ∼17 e– per protein; half of this comes from the cysteine residues. whereas the other half comes from other constituents. probably a cohort of four or five nonadhesive. redox-active DOPA residues in Mfp-6 with an anodic peak potential ∼500 mV lower than that for oxidation of cysteine to cystine.

MA,The structural macromolecules of the extracellular matrix have been investigated with rapidly increasing activity and depth in the past decade. Collagen. and to a lesser extent. elastin. were among the earliest of this group to be studied in more detail than the proteoglycans and adhesive glycoproteins. Consequently. the extent of knowledge concerning collagen is greater than any of the other structural macromolecules; one index of this phenomenon is the large number of symposia and monographs which have been devoted to collagen in the past generation. One can virtually trace an exponential growth curve of the literature concerning the structure. function and biological properties of the protein.

The reversible complexation of Fe3+ by the 3.4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) side chains in mfp-1 in Mytilus californianus cuticle is responsible for its high extensibility (120%) as well as its stiffness (2 GPa) due to the formation of sacrificial bonds that help to dissipate energy and avoid accumulation of stresses in the material. We have investigated the interactions between Fe3+ and mfp-1 from two mussel species. M. californianus (Mc) and M. edulis (Me). using both surface sensitive and solution phase techniques.

101960,"Response to comment on"" High abrasion resistance with sparse mineralization: copper biomineral in worm jaws""",2003,Helga Lichtenegger and Thomas Schöberl and Michael H Bartl and Herbert Waite and Galen D Stucky,,,,,na,Schofield and Nesson (1) express concern that the correlation between the element concentration in Glycera jaws and the mechanical properties of the jaw (2) may not reflect the correlation between atacamite mineral content and mechanical properties. They argue that there may be “unidentified nondiffracting copper and/or chlorine compounds that are predominantly responsible for mechanical properties” and criticize the use of chlorine as an indicator for the occurrence of the mineral. Although determining the exact amount of copper and chlorine bound to the mineral is indeed difficult and small amounts of further. unidentified copper-chlorine compounds (UCCCs) may well exist in the sample. our results do not yield any indicators for their occurrence. Despite careful reevaluation. we could not see the supposed significant differences between the copper. chlorine. and electron density maps in our original manuscript (3). We have. however. reexamined our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (Fig. 1). Clearly. the regions containing mineralized fibers are rich in copper and chlorine (Fig. 1A). with the copper peak greatly reduced in height in the matrix material (Fig. 1B). The remaining amount of copper is comparable to the amount in the fiber region that exceeds the Cu: Cl ratio of 2: 1 in atacamite. No chlorine at all was detected in matrix regions devoid of mineralized fibers. Hence. we conclude that chlorine constitutes a reliable indicator for the occurrence of the mineral. Notwithstanding that. we acknowledge that UCCCs could be part of the mineralized fibers.

101964,Marine metal chelating proteins,1991,Douglas C Hansen and J Herbert Waite,,,,256-262,,The attachment strategy of the common sea mussel Mytilus edulis relies on the formation of byssal threads which originate in the animal at one end and attach to a surface at the other. The point of attachment for these threads are small plaques which contain an adhesive protein. This protein contains the amino acid 3.4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). DOPA-containing proteins have been isolated from other mytilid bivalves. namely Mytilus californianus and Geukensia demissa. Being an o-diphenol. this amino acid enables the adhesive plaque to displace water molecules through hydrogen bonding and to bind to metal ions that are present in the substrata. This chemisorption effectively anchors the mussel to the surface and allows it to resist the physical forces to which it is exposed. The byssal threads of these bivalves have demonstrated preferential accumulation and sequestration of trace metals.

Thefullimpact of this particular perspective is nowhere more evident than in the high-energy intertidal zone where mussels and other sessile organisms thrive amidst aeration. nutrient cycling. and waste removal ad libitum. The benefits of a turbulent habitat are considerable. but there are also costs. A major cost for mussels is the production of a robust holdfast or byssus. The byssus provides mussels with the necessary tenacity to survive incessant buffeting by waves. In exchange. a mussel is committed to invest 10% or more ofits energy and assimilated nitrogen for making and maintaining a byssus (Jordan and Valiela. 1982). Mussel byssus consists of a bundle of short threads that resemble tiny tendons (Figure 10.1). It is constructed entirely of extraorganismic. extracellular connective tissue. In the Mytilus species (M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis). each new thread has dimensions of a few centimetres in length and less than 0.1 mm in diameter and is made in about 5 minutes in the ventral groove of the foot by a process akin to injection moulding (Waite. 1992). Like tendons. the threads originate from the byssal retractor muscles by way ofa rooted stem; unlike tendons. byssal threads do not ‘insert’onto foreign objects as tendons do to bone (Currey. 1984). Instead. byssal adhesive plaques bond only to the surface of exogenous substrata. such as stone (Tamarin et al.. 1976). For morphological clarity. the byssus is divided into four parts (from proximal to distal): root. stem. thread. and plaque or pad.

The growing importance of long-chain polyethers with their remarkable biological properties could not be foreseen in 1981. when the first marine representative of this class of compounds. okadaic acid. was described. Since then. the Gulf to Mexico red tide agents. the brevetoxins. and a ciguatera-causing compound. ciguatoxin. among others. have been structurally defined.

Higa's chapter is a timely reminder that we should not lose sight of fundamental organic chemical principles. Polyethers. discussed in Chapter 1. illustrate yet another facet of bioorganic marine chemistry. Okadaic acid. first isolated from two genera of sponges with habitats in two oceans. was subsequently recognized as a metabolite of a marine microalga. the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima.

The mechanical performance of the shell is critically reliant on 3.4-dihydroxyphenylalanine’s (Dopa) ability to form reversible iron-catecholate complexes at pH 8.

Wiley, Hoboken",,319-349,,Bioadhesion is about how living organisms attach to surfaces at different length and timescales. Model organisms for investigating bioadhesion are diverse and include sea stars [1]. barnacles [2]. polychaete worms [3]. ants [4]. geckos [5]. ivy [6]. tree frogs [7]. and mussels. among others. Not only is bioadhesion fascinating as a science. it can also have a significant impact on technology. The “double-edged blade” aspect of bioadhesion is particularly noteworthy in this regard. One “edge” of this blade is the unwanted attachment of living organisms to various surfaces. Knowing how living organisms stick to surfaces is a prerequisite to inventing effective strategies to keep them off (antifouling strategies)[8].

This is enabled by a bundle of fine protein based threads called the byssus. The byssus is emerging as an effective model system for studying the requirements for underwater adhesion. wear resistance and combined hardness and extensibility (1. 2). Careful secretion of different mussel foot proteins (mfp) combined with some metal ions (Fe3+. Zn2+ etc.) allows the mussel to tune properties and optimize function of diverse parts of byssus thread (3).Here we report in‐situ high‐resolution Raman spectroscopic imaging of the byssal coating and plaque showing micron level spatial distribution of various proteins and their interaction with Fe3+ using specific Resonance Raman (RR) spectral features. 3.4‐dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) is a strong chelator of Fe3+ within a specific pH window …,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC,2,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3482556,5331620381796697140,/scholar?cites=5331620381796697140,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew_Harrington/publication/47452451_In-situ_Raman_Spectroscopic_Imaging_of_a_Mussel_Coating_and_Adhesive/links/5439257e0cf24a6ddb9599f2/In-situ-Raman-Spectroscopic-Imaging-of-a-Mussel-Coating-and-Adhesive.pdf,0,0,0

In addition to the requirement of the multicompositional. hierarchical assembly of spatially distinct domains. there must be information exchange between the domains that can be selectively coupled with the external environment.

All four of the peptides are composed of a sequence of 36 amino acids. with the numbers and locations of the glycine (Gly). lysine (Lys) and cysteine (Cys) residues conserved (Fig. 1). The locations of the aromatic residues and leucine (Leu) hydrophobic control (X) were also conserved. The four peptides differ only by progressive hydroxylation of the aromatic residue in three of the peptides: phenylalanine (Phe). tyrosine (Tyr) and 3. 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa). The fourth peptide is a Leu analogue to test whether the strong adhesion forces we measure result from nonspecific hydrophobic and/or hydrogen-bonding interactions. The overall sequence is inspired by a Lys-and Dopa-rich sequence of 16 amino acids that is present in the mussel foot protein mefp-5. a strongly adhesive mussel foot protein prominently featured at the mussel adhesive plaque-solid interface 31. 33. Dopa is also the dominant aromatic residue in many mussel foot proteins. and thus we refer to the Dopa peptide as a mussel-mimetic peptide sequence. Although some mussel proteins also contain an appreciable Tyr content. Phe is conspicuously deficient in marine mussel adhesive proteins.Mica was selected as the substrate material because primary amines. like Lys. strongly bind to the surface of mica via ion exchange with the K+ ions present at the surface of single-crystalline mica 9. 34.

102012,Translating Mussel Adhesion: Four Uncertainties about the Interface,2016,J Herbert Waite,,,,305-321,Royal Society of Chemistry,The attachment of marine mussels to submerged solid surfaces has been the focus of numerous studies over the last twenty years. motivated both by fouling concerns and the technical limitations of adhesion in the presence of moisture. salt. corrosion. and biofilms. Several recent reviews with different perspectives have appeared on this subject. 1–3 Mussel attachment is mediated by a byssus. a peculiar brush-like holdfast that consists of hundreds of disc tipped threads made one thread at a time (Figure 9.1). Byssal attachment provides stability and. in the turbulent intertidal zone. an attribute of even greater survival value–tenacity. The factors contributing to byssal tenacity have been investigated at multiple length scales: at the centimeter scale. the radial distribution of byssal threads4 and the stiffness gradient of threads; 5 at the millimeter scale. the spatulate shape of plaques; 6 at the micrometer scale. the porous ‘‘cellular’’structure of the plaque; 7 and at the nanometer scale. the interfacial chemistry at the plaque–substrate interface8 (Figure 9.1 A–D).

102013,Versatile underwater adhesive with microarchitecture triggered by solvent exchange,2016,Dong Woog Lee and Qiang Zhao and Kollbe Ahn and Sungbaek Seo and Yair Kaufman and Jacob Israelachvili and Herbert Waite,,,,,American Chemical Society,Polyelectrolyte complexation is critical to the formation and properties of many biological and polymeric materials. and is typically initiated by aqueous solution mixing that results in fluid-fluid phase separation. e.g.. coacervation. Here we report a versatile and strong wet-contact adhesive inspired by sandcastle worm cement that enables both a triggered complexation of polyelectrolytes. and formation of a porous architecture. A catecholfunctionalized weak poly-anion was premixed with a poly-cation in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The polymer solution was applied underwater to substrates where electrostatic complexation. phase inversion. and rapid setting were actuated by water-DMSO solvent exchange. This process offers enhanced spatial and temporal control of complexation. thereby fostering rapid (≥ 25 s) and robust underwater adhesion (Wad ≥ 2 J/m2) of complexed catecholic polyelectrolytes to all tested surfaces including plastics. glasses. metals. and biological surfaces. The solvent exchange process is adaptable to diverse materials chemistry. supporting functionalities well beyond aqueous complex coacervates.,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:lgwcVrK6X84C,0,https://scholarworks.unist.ac.kr/handle/201301/37345,,,,,0,0,0

Adhesion is mediated by a byssus. essentially a bundle of leathery threads that emerge from the living mussel tissue at one end. and tipped by flat adhesive plaques at the other. Byssal plaques consist of a complex array of proteins (mostly mussel foot proteins. Mfps). each of which has a distinct localization and function in the structure. but all share the unusual modified amino acid 3. 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa. see Figure 3.1).,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C,0,https://escholarship.org/content/qt6688t4m8/qt6688t4m8.pdf#page=111,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt6688t4m8/qt6688t4m8.pdf#page=111,0,0,0

The attachment is accomplished via a wide adhesive plaque interpenetrated by the collagen-rich fibers of a thin long thread that connects the plaque at the distal end to the mussel at the proximal end. While the robust and versatile adhesion of the plaque has been attributed to the molecular adhesive properties. we propose that microscopic geometry. interior structure and the penetration (or lack thereof) of the thread are critical in load distribution and enhancement of adhesive performance.We present novel results on the structure of plaques from a variety of genera (Modiolus. Mytilus and Septifer) and species (M. californianus. M. galloprovincialis) studied via electron microscopy and neutron scattering.

However. by nature. the large deformability compromises the Young's modulus and the toughness of the elastomer to low values (< 2MPa) and imparts brittle fracture. We employ the mussel-inspired strategy of iron-catechol coordination bonding creating dynamic. reversible cross-links in addition to permanent chemical cross-links in an elastomer used in ambient. dry conditions. This simple additional energy dissipative mechanism results in increased modulus and toughness without affecting the network extensibility. which is based on the covalent network. Control of the chain relaxation time scales can be further tuned using the dynamic bonds. imparting mechanical rate dependent properties to the bulk material. The quantitative understanding of the time scales associated with …,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016APS..MARC37010F/abstract,,,,,0,0,0
102018,Rate-Dependent Stiffness and Recovery in Interpenetrating Network Hydrogels through,2015,MS Menyo and CJ Hawker and JH Waite,,"ACS Macro Letters, 4 (11)",,,,Four-arm poly (ethylene glycol)(PEG) star polymers modified with 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone (HOPO) end groups were shown to form transient. coordination networks upon addition of trivalent cations In3+. Fe3+. and Al3+. These coordination-based hydrogels exhibited high activation energies of viscoelasticity (34 kT) and characteristic bond lifetimes tunable over 2 orders of magnitude and could be incorporated into poly (hydroxyethylacrylamide)-based covalent scaffolds to create interpenetrating network hydrogels. Measurements carried out in compression and tension demonstrate that the secondary coordination network imparts toughness and stiffness to the overall material. and unlike traditional interpenetrating networks (IPNs). the extent of toughening is dependent on the rate at which the materials are deformed. The dynamic character of the coordination network also allows recovery after mechanical damage following high amplitude strains.,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16979733399169710595&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
