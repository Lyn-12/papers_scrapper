Psychiatric disorder in the offspring was assessed as a function of: (1) age of the parent at the onset of symptoms of HD; (2) family disorganization; and (3) psychiatric disorder in either parent. The findings indicated an increased frequency of conduct disorder in disrupted families. most especially in those where the HD parent had an early onset of symptoms and the non-HD parent showed psychiatric disorder. Affective disorder in the offspring was most strongly associated with the presence of similar symptoms in the HD parent. Affective disorder. but not conduct disorder. may be an early manifestation of the HD gene.

Education. and Welfare. Public Health Service. National Institutes of Health,We studied the course of nausea and vomiting after high-dose cyclophosphamide (50-75 mg/kg) in 25 patients. Nausea was assessed with a visual analog scale and vomiting by patient report. The reliability and validity of these methods of assessment were established in separate studies of oncology patients. Nausea and vomiting developed between 6 and 12 hours after the start of a 1-hour cyclophosphamide infusion in about two thirds of the patients. Peak symptoms were at 12 hours. Vomiting had subsided in most of the patients by 24 hours. but nausea persisted. Although there was significant individual variation in the course of nausea and vomiting. we could identify no demographic. disease. drug. or treatment factors which were associated with more significant nausea and vomiting. Some of the variability in the onset. severity. and duration of nausea and vomiting may be related to individual differences in the metabolism of and susceptibility to cyclophosphamide.

Both types of self-injury are common in prisons. which have a predominantly male population; however. most studies of nonlethal self-injury have been done with female subjects. This exploratory study tested the hypothesis that prisoners who injured themselves without intending to die would differ clinically from prisoners who had attempted suicide. Inmates admitted to the prison unit of a public hospital for treatment of selfinflicted wounds or who had a history of previous self-injury were administered a standardized intake protocol by the first author. which included asking about their intent at the time they injured themselves. Patients were classified as selfmutilators or suicide attempters on the basis of intent. Fifteen patients reported that they had attempted to take their own lives. while 16 reported other reasons for harming themselves. Suicide attempt was associated with adult affective disorder (13115 versus 2/16 mutilators); self-mutilation with a history of childhood hyperactivity (la16 versus 1115 suicide attempters) and a mixed dysthymialanxiety syndrome that began in childhood or early adolescence (9116). Prison selfmutilators and suicide attempters had very different clinical presentations and histories.

For predicting adaptive functioning. both duration of symptoms and neurological status were important variables.

The authors examined the relationship of homocysteine. folate. and vitamin B12 with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of neuropathology. METHODS: In this archival study. authors reviewed the MRIs and medical records of 34 inpatients in a geriatric psychiatry unit. Patients were selected if folate. B12. and/or homocysteine levels had been assessed and if the appropriate clinical MRIs were performed (19 men; mean age. 75 years). Patients with schizophrenia or current substance dependence were excluded. The relationships between MRI volume measures. white-matter hyperintensity (WMH) grade. and serum concentrations of folate. B12. and homocysteine were analyzed. using age-adjusted Pearson correlations. RESULTS: Homocysteine was related to WMH grade. but not brain-volume measures. Folate was associated with hippocampus and amygdala. and negatively associated with WMH. B12 level was not statistically associated with any brain measure. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated homocysteine and low folate were associated with radiological markers of neuropathology. Since no patient had clinically deficient folate. it may be important to rethink what defines functionally significant micronutrient deficiency and explore what this means in different age-and health-status groups. Larger samples will be needed to assess interactions between homocysteine. micronutrients …,True,3JsfnzsAAAAJ:H7nrzBkawXsC,96,https://europepmc.org/article/med/15545331,6572673331880417558,/scholar?cites=6572673331880417558,,,0

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is more sensitive to white matter damage than conventional MRI. The relationship between DTI measures and gait has not been previously evaluated. Our purpose was to investigate the relationship between the integrity of white matter in the corpus callosum as determined by DTI and quantitative measures of gait in the elderly.Methods— One hundred seventy-three participants of a community-dwelling elderly cohort had neurological and neuropsychological examinations and brain MRI. Gait function was measured by Tinetti gait (0 to 12). balance (0 to 16) and total (0 to 28) scores. DTI assessed fractional anisotropy in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum.

A model for the age-dependent expression of an autosomal dominant gene,1986,John CS Breitner and Marshal F Folstein and Edmond A Murphy,20,Journal of psychiatric research,1,31-43,Pergamon,An autosomal dominant genetic etiology has been proposed for Alzheimer Dementia (AD). but many cases appear to be sporadic. Evaluation of the possible genetic transmission of AD from its familial aggregation requires consideration of (1) the proportion of index cases with genetic disease. and (2) the consequences of typically very late onset. To investigate these factors. a provisional biomathematical genetic model was developed from the empirical age-specific incidence of AD in relatives. Based upon the premise of an autosomal dominant AD gene in proband families. the modeling technique provides estimates of the proportion of genetic index cases (as opposed to phenocopies) and the parameters of age-dependent gene expression. With appropriate parameters the model accurately reflects the age-specific familial risk of AD. suggesting the appropriateness of its underlying assumptions.
