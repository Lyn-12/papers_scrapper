10293,Chatbot-based Tourist Recommendations Using Model-based Reasoning.,2018,Iulia Nica and Oliver A Tazl and Franz Wotawa,,,,25-30,,Chatbots have gained increasing importance for research and practice with a lot of applications available today including Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri. In this paper. we present the underlying methods and technologies behind a Chatbot for e-tourism that allows people textually communicate with the purpose of booking hotels. planning trips. and asking for interesting sights worth being visit. In particular. we show how model-based reasoning can be used for enhancing user experience during a chat. eg. in cases where too many possible selections are available or where user preferences are too restricted causing inconsistencies and as a consequence not possible answers to be provided. Besides the underlying foundations. we provide a use case from the intended tourism domain to show how such a model-based chatbot effectively can be used in practice.,True,f5mn-CoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,17,https://novuscpq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/proceedings-configuration-workshop-2018_YslTwntH.pdf#page=33,8868946525425084129,/scholar?cites=8868946525425084129,,https://novuscpq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/proceedings-configuration-workshop-2018_YslTwntH.pdf#page=33,0
10294,Chatbot testing using AI planning,2019,Josip Bozic and Oliver A Tazl and Franz Wotawa,,,,37-44,IEEE,Chatbots. i.e.. systems that can interact with humans in a more appropriate way using natural language. have been of increasing importance. This is due the fact of the availability of computational means for natural language interaction between computers and humans that are becoming closer to the interaction between humans alone. Consequently. there are more and more chatbots available that are intended to support humans organizing tasks or making decisions. In this paper. we focus on how to verify the communication capabilities provided by chatbots. In particular. we introduce an automated approach for generating communication sequences and carrying them out. The approach is based on AI planning where each action can be assumed to be a certain question that is given to the chatbot. The answer of the chatbot should make the action post-condition true. in order to proceed with the plan.

Cham,Chatbots as conversational recommender have gained increasing importance for research and practice with a lot of applications available today. In this paper. we present the methods to support conversational defaults within a human-chatbot conversation that simplifies communication with the purpose of improving the overall recommendation process. In particular. we discuss our model-based reasoning approach for easing user experience during a chat. e.g.. in cases where user preferences are mentioned indirectly causing inconsistencies. As a consequence of inconsistencies. it would not be possible for the chatbot to provide answers and recommendations. The presented approach allows for removing inconsistencies during the interactions with the chatbot. Besides the basic foundations. we provide use cases from the intended tourism domain to show the simplification of the conversation process.

10296,Conversational recommendations using model-based reasoning,2019,Oliver A Tazl and Alexander Perko and Franz Wotawa,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2467,13-19,RWTH Aachen,Chatbots as conversational recommender have gained increasing importance over the years. The chatbot market offers a variety of applications for research and industry alike. In this paper. we discuss an implementation that supports the use of our recommendation algorithm during chatbot communication. The program eases communication and improves the underlying recommendation flow. In particular. the implementation makes use of our model-based reasoning approach for improving user experience during a chat. ie. in cases where user configurations cause inconsistencies. The approach deals with such issues by removing inconsistencies in order to generate a valid recommendation. In addition to the underlying definitions. we demonstrate our implementation along use cases from the tourism domain.,True,f5mn-CoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ffec/b614af311c1c12d4b11330c921f22b475e39.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ffec/b614af311c1c12d4b11330c921f22b475e39.pdf,0

10307,Coarse-to-fine classification for image-based face detection,2006,Hanjin Ryu and Ja-Cheon Yoon and Seung Soo Chun and Sanghoon Sull,,,,291-299,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Traditional image-based face detection methods use a window based scanning technique where the window is scanned pixel-by-pixel to search for faces in various positions and scales within an image. Therefore. they require high computation cost and are not adequate to the real time applications. In this paper. we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine classification method for image-based face detection using multiple face classifiers. A coarse location of a face is first classified by the gradient feature based face classifier where the window is scanned in large moving steps. From the coarse location of a face. the fine classification is performed to identify the local image as a face using the multiple face classifiers where the window is finely scanned. The multiple face classifiers are designed to take gradient. texture and pixel intensity features and trained by back propagation learning algorithm.
