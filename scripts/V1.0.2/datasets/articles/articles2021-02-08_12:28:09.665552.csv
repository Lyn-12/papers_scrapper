Rev.,,1847,,Americans long ago dedicated themselves to the removal of social and economic barriers that unfairly burdened racial and ethnic minorities. women. and older people. Discrimination against individuals on the basis of their membership in artificially defined groups was rejected. The current crisis in health care expenditures. however. may be reviving some old prejudices and creating new ones. particularly against older people. Questions have been raised about older Americans. their place in society. and their rightful claim on resources such as health care.

88455,Roundabout crash prediction models,2009,SA Turner and Aaron P Roozenburg and AW Smith,,New Zealand Transport Agency Research Report,386,,,The management of speed is considered an important safety issue at roundabouts. The approach speed and negotiating speed through roundabouts depends on the geometric design of the roundabout and sight distance. In New Zealand and in Australia. the design standards recommend long approach sight distances and provision of relatively high design speeds. This is in contrast to European roundabouts. where visibility is normally restricted and the geometric design encourages slow approach and negotiation speeds. This work. undertaken in 2006. extends previous research by the authors developing crash prediction models at roundabouts to include sight distance. intersection layout and observed speed variables. Models have been produced for the major motor vehicles only. pedestrians versus motor vehicles and cyclists versus motor vehicle crash types. Flow-only models have also been produced for roundabouts on roads with high speed limits. The models produced indicate that roundabouts with lower speeds (observed and speed limit). fewer approach lanes and reduced visibilities have lower crash rates.(a),True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:QI7uKX5mnFEC,32,https://trid.trb.org/view/914540,9556651759194684897,/scholar?cites=9556651759194684897,,,0,0,0

The WOx films used as anodes also contained Pt ‘micro’-centers. Comparative oxidation studies were also carried out using antimony doped SnO2 anodes. More rapid (COOH)2 oxidation rates were observed for the WOx based anodes than for the antimony doped SnO2 anodes. The (COOH)2 oxidation reaction studied under the conditions used in this work was shown to be activation rather than mass transport controlled. The (COOH)2 oxidation rate constant was found to be independent of the applied potential using the WOx based anodes. This likely suggests that a chemical reaction is involved in the (COOH)2 oxidation reaction.

Water. Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA) commissioned the Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research (ARIER) to undertake research to evaluate detection methods and sampling designs used to determine the abundance of feral cats (Felis catus) that have established wild populations in Australia. Stage one of the project. undertaken at Anglesea in Victoria in September 2007. investigated the detection probability of cage traps. leghold traps. a DNA sampling device. heat-in-motion activated digital cameras and sand plots (Robley et al. 2008). This required the capture of feral cats. fitting GPS data-logging collars. mapping their areas of activity and monitoring their encounter with the various devices. Digital cameras provided the most robust detection data for feral cats. Modelling of control efficacy determined that the probability of correctly concluding that a cat population had decreased was highest for the highest level of monitoring (49 cameras for 20 nights. set at one camera per 2 km2).,True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:H_jBuBxbQIAC,27,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan_Robley/publication/275155842_Evaluation_of_camera_trap_sampling_designs_used_to_determine_change_in_occupancy_rate_and_abundance_of_feral_cats/links/55dbb9b508ae9d6594936883/Evaluation-of-camera-trap-sampling-designs-used-to-determine-change-in-occupancy-rate-and-abundance-of-feral-cats.pdf,9670327622172929149,/scholar?cites=9670327622172929149,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan_Robley/publication/275155842_Evaluation_of_camera_trap_sampling_designs_used_to_determine_change_in_occupancy_rate_and_abundance_of_feral_cats/links/55dbb9b508ae9d6594936883/Evaluation-of-camera-trap-sampling-designs-used-to-determine-change-in-occupancy-rate-and-abundance-of-feral-cats.pdf,0,0,0

To determine whether cocaine has any effect on uptake during pregnancy. we evaluated the ability of the term pregnant human uterus to take up [3H]-norepinephrine (9 x 10 (-8) mol/L) and the ability of cocaine (10 (-6)-10 (-8) mol/L) to block this uptake. Because d-propranolol has been shown to block the direct effects of cocaine on the pregnant rabbit uterus. we also evaluated the ability of d-propranolol (2 x 10 (-6) mol/L) to block the effect of cocaine on catecholamine uptake. The ability of the Uptake 2 inhibitor hydrocortisone (2 x 10 (-5) mol/L) to block catecholamine uptake was also studied. We found that [3H]-norepinephrine was taken up by both the pregnant myometrium and endometrium. and that cocaine blocked this uptake by up to 55% at concentrations as low as 10 (-7) mol/L. D-propranolol had no effect on the ability of cocaine to block catecholamine uptake. Hydrocortisone blocked uptake by the endometrium by 15% but did not block uptake by the myometrium. We conclude that the pregnant human uterus at term retains the ability to take up catecholamines and that cocaine blocks this extraneuronal uptake. This may explain. in part. the association of cocaine use with premature labor.,True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC,26,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2067771,9765321225592682384,/scholar?cites=9765321225592682384,,,0,0,0

As such additional dimensions are incorporated into a constitutive model. it becomes progressively more complex and challenging to fit uniquely without invoking unrealistic numbers of fitting attempts starting from myriad sets of trial parameters. For 8-parameter constitutive equations similar to the ones investigated here. the literature reports fitting with 28 (256) starting sets of trial parameters. requiring 256 nonlinear optimizations using special programming. thus making such procedures impractical for many applications.

Dorsiflexion of the ankle. external rotation of the leg. or a combination of both can disrupt the syndesmotic ligament complex. including the anterior and posterior tibiofibular ligaments. Diagnostic maneuvers. such as the squeeze test and the external rotation test. plus radiographic findings help make the diagnosis. Less severe sprains can be treated nonoperatively with protected weight bearing. but grade 3 sprains require surgical anatomic reduction of the syndesmotic joint. If misdiagnosed or managed incorrectly. syndesmotic injuries can lead to unfavorable late sequelae.

They contain six known species of Mabuya skinks. Phylogeographical relationships within and among the relatively widespread taxa M. stangeri. M. spinalis and M. delalandii were inferred. based on ≈ 1 kbp of the cytochrome b gene (mitochondrial DNA). Reciprocal monophyly of M. spinalis and M. stangeri was established. which may have arisen from an early Pliocene/late Miocene cladogenetic event. Considerable between‐island sequence divergence was detected among M. spinalis. which appears to have colonized the older islands (Sal and Boavista) first. Much lower sequence divergence was found in M. delalandii. indicating a more recent range expansion. Here. evidence points to colonization of the younger islands of Brava and Fogo soon after appearance.

88553,Landmark-defense and scramble competition mating systems in two Australian tachinid flies (Diptera),1995,John Alcock and Andrew P Smith,,Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society,,85-94,Kansas Entomological Society,"Two species of Australian tachinid flies exhibit distinctly different mate-locating tactics. Males of Microtopesa sinuata Donovan engage in landmark-territoriality with individuals defending small perching areas at local ""hilltops"" along a ridgeline. Territory ownership is established through ritualized aerial contests. Different populations of males rank perch sites similarly. Some males exhibit strong fidelity to a given site over a period of as much as 2 wk.

88554,Parental perceptions of information about medication prescribed for their children.,1993,AM Counsell and DC Geddis and AR Smith,106,The New Zealand Medical Journal,956,205-206,,AIMS: The study aimed to examine parents' perceptions of the information provided to them on prescribed medication; how it might be improved and; parental level of knowledge of medication administration. METHODS: 245 parents completed a questionnaire at a preschool health day. The questionnaire covered parental opinion on whether the doctor provided enough information about illness and medication. recall of pharmacist's instructions on medication. parental general knowledge of medication and what parents wanted to know about medication for their children. RESULTS: The findings indicated there was an overall lack of information from the doctor on side effects and what to do if problems occurred with medication. Furthermore. half (49%) of the parents did not recall receiving any information from the pharmacist. Parents appeared to understand the basics of medication administration. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that improvements should be made regarding the information given to parents on prescribed medication. This may improve satisfaction with the service received from health professionals. such as doctors and pharmacists. and increase patient compliance with treatment regimes.,True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:pk6FPx6l9xIC,15,https://europepmc.org/article/med/8341440,15358906961458688391,/scholar?cites=15358906961458688391,,,0,0,0

The literature tends to frame informal learning. formal learning and non-formal learning as discrete activities and such a view fails to take into account the interconnections between them. Web 2.0 virtual social learning systems offer ways in which opportunities for informal learning can occur. often as a means of supporting formal education. With social constructivism being widely accepted as a theory for teaching and learning it is surprising how little is understood about learning in virtual social learning systems.In this paper four case studies are presented to illuminate the power of virtual social learning environments in supporting informal learning and peer learning and challenges associated with its use in formal education. Although tentative because of the scale of the study. data from this research points to an inverse correlation between the opportunities for face-to-face communication and use of the virtual social environment.

The lower limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 8.697 x 10-3 µg/ml and limit of quantification (LOQ) was found to be 26.355 x 10-3 µg/ml in formulation. The different experimental parameters affecting the fluorescence intensity were carefully studied and optimized. Common excipients used as additives in pharmaceutical preparations which do not interfere in the proposed method. The proposed method was applied successfully for determination of flutamide in the pharmaceutical preparation. The percentage recovery was found to be 99.53±0.5283.,True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:9VeumLvkZSQC,13,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.526.6991,3905327858528199886,/scholar?cites=3905327858528199886,,,0,0,0

Twelve low bloat (402 ± 12 kg liveweight. LW) and 12 high bloat (334 ± 13 kg LW) Friesian × Jersey mixed age (2–4 years old) non-lactating and non-pregnant female cattle were used in a late autumn (June) grazing experiment involving two periods (P1 and P2). Methane emissions were measured during 5 (P1) or 4 (P2) consecutive days using the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer technique. In P1 only. titanium dioxide (TiO2) was used for faecal output and feed dry matter intake (DMI) estimations and it was found that the selection lines did not differ in DMI per unit of LW (17.3 ± 1.3 v. 15.4 ± 1.3 g DMI/kg LW.

Research has demonstrated that caffeine has beneficial effects on performance of tasks requiring sustained attention and that these effects are readily observed in low alertness situations (after lunch; at night; when a person has a cold). Although many of the studies of caffeine have used very large single doses. recent studies have demonstrated that beneficial effects can be observed with more realistic doses and drinking regimes that equate to real-life intake.
