81928,Regulated portals of entry into the cell,2003,Sean D Conner and Sandra L Schmid,422,,6927,37-44,Nature Publishing Group,The plasma membrane is the interface between cells and their harsh environment. Uptake of nutrients and all communication among cells and between cells and their environment occurs through this interface.‘Endocytosis’ encompasses several diverse mechanisms by which cells internalize macromolecules and particles into transport vesicles derived from the plasma membrane. It controls entry into the cell and has a crucial role in development. the immune response. neurotransmission. intercellular communication. signal transduction. and cellular and organismal homeostasis. As the complexity of molecular interactions governing endocytosis are revealed. it has become increasingly clear that it is tightly coordinated and coupled with overall cell physiology and thus. must be viewed in a broader context than simple vesicular trafficking.,True,_WWra9AAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,4138,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01451,13458419135424189094,/scholar?cites=13458419135424189094,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sandra_Schmid2/publication/10870479_Conner_SD_Schmid_SL_Regulated_portals_of_entry_into_the_cell_Nature_422_37-44/links/55100e2e0cf21287416cb96a/Conner-SD-Schmid-SL-Regulated-portals-of-entry-into-the-cell-Nature-422-37-44.pdf,0,0,0
81929,Robust single-particle tracking in live-cell time-lapse sequences,2008,Khuloud Jaqaman and Dinah Loerke and Marcel Mettlen and Hirotaka Kuwata and Sergio Grinstein and Sandra L Schmid and Gaudenz Danuser,5,Nature methods,8,695-702,Nature Publishing Group,Single-particle tracking (SPT) is often the rate-limiting step in live-cell imaging studies of subcellular dynamics. Here we present a tracking algorithm that addresses the principal challenges of SPT. namely high particle density. particle motion heterogeneity. temporary particle disappearance. and particle merging and splitting. The algorithm first links particles between consecutive frames and then links the resulting track segments into complete trajectories. Both steps are formulated as global combinatorial optimization problems whose solution identifies the overall most likely set of particle trajectories throughout a movie. Using this approach. we show that the GTPase dynamin differentially affects the kinetics of long-and short-lived endocytic structures and that the motion of CD36 receptors along cytoskeleton-mediated linear tracks increases their aggregation probability. Both applications indicate the requirement for …,True,_WWra9AAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,1400,https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v5/n8/abs/nmeth.1237.html,2222068926863261097,/scholar?cites=2222068926863261097,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747604/,0,0,0
