Several classes of PRRs. including Toll-like receptors and cytoplasmic receptors. recognize distinct microbial components and directly activate immune cells. Exposure of immune cells to the ligands of these receptors activates intracellular signaling cascades that rapidly induce the expression of a variety of overlapping and unique genes involved in the inflammatory and immune responses.

52,Toll-like receptors,2003,Kiyoshi Takeda and Tsuneyasu Kaisho and Shizuo Akira,21,,1,335-376,Annual Reviews,The innate immune system in drosophila and mammals senses the invasion of microorganisms using the family of Toll receptors. stimulation of which initiates a range of host defense mechanisms. In drosophila antimicrobial responses rely on two signaling pathways: the Toll pathway and the IMD pathway. In mammals there are at least 10 members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family that recognize specific components conserved among microorganisms. Activation of the TLRs leads not only to the induction of inflammatory responses but also to the development of antigen-specific adaptive immunity. The TLR-induced inflammatory response is dependent on a common signaling pathway that is mediated by the adaptor molecule MyD88.

How TLR4 coordinates the activation of these two pathways is unknown. Here we show that TLR4 activated these two signaling pathways sequentially in a process organized around endocytosis of the TLR4 complex.

Direct cloning of NF-IL6 revealed its homology with C/EBP. C/EBP is expressed in liver and adipose tissues and is supposed to regulate several hepatocyte-and adipocyte-specific genes. In contrast. NF-IL6 is suppressed in normal tissues. but is rapidly and drastically induced by LPS or inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1. TNF. and IL-6. NF-IL6 can also bind to the regulatory region of various genes including IL-8. G-CSF. IL-1 and immunoglobulin genes. Furthermore. NF-IL6 is shown to be identical to IL-6DBP. a DNA-binding protein responsible for IL-6-mediated induction in acute-phase proteins. demonstrating that NF-IL6 is responsible for the genes regulated by IL-6. These results indicate that NF-IL6 may be a pleiotropic mediator of many inducible genes involved in acute. immune. and inflammatory responses. like NFkB. In this regard. it is noteworthy that both an NF-IL6 binding site and an NFkB binding site are present in the inducible genes such as IL-6. IL-8. and several acute-phase genes. On the other hand. accumulating evidence has revealed that overproduction of IL-6 may be responsible for the pathogenesis and/or several symptoms of a variety of diseases. including autoimmune diseases. malignancies. and viral diseases.

At the onset of involution. Stat3 is specifically activated. To address the function of this signaling molecule in mammary epithelial apoptosis. we have generated a conditional knockout of Stat3 using the Cre-lox recombination system. Following weaning. a decrease in apoptosis and a dramatic delay of involution occurred in Stat3 null mammary tissue. Involution is normally associated with a significant increase in IGFBP-5 levels. This was observed in control glands. but not in the absence of Stat3. IGFBP-5 has been suggested to induce apoptosis by sequestering IGF-1 to casein micelles. thereby inhibiting its survival function.

Inducers of the NLRP3 inflammasome caused aberrant mitochondrial homeostasis to diminish the concentration of the coenzyme NAD+. which in turn inactivated the NAD+-dependent α-tubulin deacetylase sirtuin 2; this resulted in the accumulation of acetylated α-tubulin. Acetylated α-tubulin mediated the dynein-dependent transport of mitochondria and subsequent apposition of ASC on mitochondria to NLRP3 on the endoplasmic reticulum.

Leptin and insulin have been implicated as circulating indicators of adiposity. but it is not clear how changes in their levels are perceived or integrated by individual neuronal subtypes. We developed mice in which a fluorescent reporter for PI3K activity is targeted to either Agrp or POMC neurons and used 2-photon microscopy to measure dynamic regulation of PI3K by insulin and leptin in brain slices. We show that leptin and insulin act in parallel to stimulate PI3K in POMC neurons but in opposite ways on Agrp neurons. These results suggest a new view of hypothalamic circuitry. in which the effects of leptin and insulin are integrated by anorexigenic but not by orexigenic neurons.,True,0TG2laoAAAAJ:2ZctHUgIzyAC,436,https://www.jci.org/articles/view/24301,17279234352283375118,/scholar?cites=17279234352283375118,,https://www.jci.org/articles/view/24301,0

255,Toll-like receptors and innate immunity,2001,Shizuo Akira,78,Advances in immunology,,1-56,ACADEMIC PRESS INC LTD,Immunity in higher organisms can be broadly categorized into adaptive immunity and innate immunity. Adaptive immunity is mediated by clonally distributed T and B lymphocytes which provide immunological specificity and memory. In contrast. innate immunity is mediated by the action of other cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. and traditionally has been characterized as nonspecific. However. recent findings have shown that innate immunity has some capacity for specific recognition. For example. insects. which lack the high level of immune specificity and memory characteristics of vertebrates. can nevertheless combat the invasion of microbes rapidly and efficiently by producing specific antimicrobial peptides. The synthesis of these specific antimicrobial peptides is triggered by the differential activation of different Toll family receptors present on the cell surface. More recently. various studies have demonstrated that many aspects of innate immune systems are shared between insects and mammals. and indeed have shown that such systems play a crucial role in the immune response in higher organisms such as mammals (Hoffmann et al.. 1999). Microbial invasion in mammals is first handled by the innate immune system. which is designed to control and eventually resolve the infection.

Individual TLRs recognize distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The TLR family harbors an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain as well as a cytoplasmic domain that is homologous to that of interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R). Upon stimulation. TLR recruits IL-1R-associated protein kinases via adaptor MyD88. and finally induces activation of nuclear factor-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases. However. the response to TLR ligands varies. indicating the diversity of TLR signaling pathways. Besides MyD88. several novel adaptor molecules have recently been identified.

Certain microbial structures and molecules. which are crucial for their survival and virulence. are recognized by different families of evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). This recognition initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the transcription of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to eliminate pathogens and attract immune cells. thereby perpetuating further adaptive immune responses. Considerable research on the molecular mechanisms underlying host–pathogen interactions has resulted in the discovery of multifarious PRRs.

348,Role of adapters in Toll-like receptor signalling,2003,S Akira and M Yamamoto and K Takeda,31,,3,637-642,Portland Press Ltd.,Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in the detection of invading pathogens within the body and the subsequent immune response. Individual TLRs recognize distinct microbial components. The TLRs are a type 1 transmembrane receptor that possess an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain and cytoplasmic domain homologous with that of the interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) family. Upon stimulation. TLR recruits the IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) via the adapter MyD88. ultimately leading to the activation of nuclear factor-κB. Cytokine production in response to all TLR ligands is completely abolished in MyD88-deficient cells. indicating that MyD88 is an essential signalling molecule shared among members of the IL-1R/Toll family. However. several novel adaptor molecules have recently been identified.

TLR‐dependent recognition of PAMPs leads to activation of the innate immune system. which subsequently leads to activation of antigen‐specific adaptive immunity. The TLR‐mediated signaling pathways consist of the MyD88‐dependent pathway and TRIF‐dependent pathway. both of which induce gene expression.

Nucleic acids. which are critical components for inheriting genetic information in all species including pathogens. are key structures sensed by the innate immune system. The corresponding receptors for foreign nucleic acids include members of Toll‐like receptors. RIG‐I‐like receptors. and intracellular DNA sensors. While nucleic acid recognition by these receptors is required for host defense against the pathogen. there is a potential risk to the host of self‐nucleic acids recognition. thus precipitating autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases.

Recent studies have demonstrated that TLRs are activated by endogenous signals. such as heat shock proteins and oxidative stress. which may contribute to congestive heart failure. Oxidative stress is one of the major factors in doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cardiac dysfunction. Thus. we hypothesized that TLRs contribute to the pathogenesis of Dox-induced cardiac dysfunction.Methods and Results— Cardiac dysfunction was induced by a single injection of Dox (20 mg/kg IP) into wild-type (WT) mice and TLR-2–knockout (KO) mice.

IFN-I receptor knockout (Ifnar1−/−) mice develop significant defects in the infiltration of Ly6Chi monocytes in the lung after influenza infection (A/PR/8/34. H1N1). Ly6Chi monocytes of wild-type (WT) mice are the main producers of MCP-1 while the alternatively generated Ly6Cint monocytes of Ifnar1−/− mice mainly produce KC for neutrophil influx. As a consequence. Ifnar1−/− mice recruit more neutrophils after influenza infection than do WT mice. Treatment of IFNAR1 blocking antibody on the WT bone marrow (BM) cells in vitro failed to differentiate into Ly6Chi monocytes. By using BM chimeric mice (WT BM into Ifnar1−/− and vice versa). we confirmed that IFN-I signaling in hematopoietic cells is required for the generation of Ly6Chi monocytes. Of note. WT BM reconstituted Ifnar1−/− chimeric mice with increased numbers of Ly6Chi monocytes survived longer than influenza-infected Ifnar1−/− mice. In contrast. WT mice that received Ifnar1−/− BM cells with alternative Ly6Cint monocytes and increased numbers of neutrophils exhibited higher mortality rates than WT mice given WT BM cells.

In these mice. host resistance was impaired. as shown by increased number of organisms in both lungs and brains. compared with control mice. Serum IFN-γ was still detected in these mice at a considerable level (20–30% of that in control mice). The host resistance was moderately impaired in IL-12p40−/− mice compared with IFN-γ−/− mice. Neutralizing anti-IFN-γ mAb further increased the lung burdens of organisms.

Since poxviruses are large DNA viruses. we hypothesized that their detection by DCs may involve the endosomal DNA recognition receptor TLR9. Indeed. we have shown here that DC recognition of ectromelia virus (ECTV). the causative agent of mousepox. completely depended on TLR9. The importance of TLR9 was highlighted by the fact that mice lacking TLR9 showed drastically increased susceptibility to infection with ECTV. In contrast. we found that the strongly attenuated poxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) activated DCs by both TLR9-dependent and -independent pathways.

The mechanisms by which neutrophils gain entry to the respiratory tract and their role during pathogenesis remain unclear. Here. we report that neutrophils significantly contributed to morbidity in a pathological mouse model of influenza virus infection. Using extensive immunohistochemistry. bone marrow transfers. and depletion studies. we identified neutrophils as the predominant pulmonary cellular source of the gelatinase matrix metalloprotease (MMP) 9. which is capable of digesting the extracellular matrix. Furthermore. infection of MMP9-deficient mice showed that MMP9 was functionally required for neutrophil migration and control of viral replication in the respiratory tract. Although MMP9 release was toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling-dependent. MyD88-mediated signals in non-hematopoietic cells. rather than neutrophil TLRs themselves. were important for neutrophil migration. These results were extended using multiplex analyses of inflammatory mediators to show that neutrophil chemotactic factor. CCL3. and TNFα were reduced in the Myd88−/− airways. Furthermore. TNFα induced MMP9 secretion by neutrophils and blocking TNFα in vivo reduced neutrophil recruitment after infection. Innate recognition of influenza virus therefore provides the mechanisms to induce recruitment of neutrophils through chemokines and to enable their motility within the tissue via MMP9-mediated cleavage of the basement membrane.

We have previously described a role for C-X-C chemokine (CXCL5) in neutrophil trafficking during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation in mice. The aims of the present study were to identify the cellular origin of CXCL5 and to determine the signaling cascades that regulate its expression in the lung during LPS-induced inflammation and in isolated LPS-stimulated CXCL5-expressing cells.

Paradoxically. epidemiological and experimental data have shown that some microorganisms can also prevent these pathologies. This observation is at the origin of the hygiene hypothesis according to which the decline of infections in western countries is at the origin of the increased incidence of both Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases and Th2-mediated allergic diseases over the last decades. We have tested whether Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation can recapitulate the protective effect of infectious agents on allergy and autoimmunity.  Methods and Findings Here. we performed a systematic study of the disease-modifying effects of a set of natural or synthetic TLR agonists using two experimental models. ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma and spontaneous autoimmune diabetes. presenting the same genetic background of the non obese diabetic mouse (NOD) that is highly susceptible to both pathologies.

We demonstrate that multiple TLR agonists prevent from both allergy and autoimmunity when administered parenterally. Probiotics which stimulate TLRs also protect from these two diseases.

SARS-CoV. emerged suddenly in 2003. causing approximately 8000 human cases and more than 700 deaths worldwide. Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans. the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear. Recently. our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice. In contrast. intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs. lung inflammation. destruction of lung tissue. and loss of body weight. thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection. Here. we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88−/−). an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR). IL-1R. and IL-18R signaling. are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection. The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection. MyD88−/− mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection. Despite increased viral loads. the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88−/− mice compared to wild-type mice.

Studies on cytokine signal transduction have clarified the mechanism by which IL4 exerts its functions. Two cytoplasmic proteins. signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 and IL4-induced phosphotyrosine substrate/insulin receptor substrate 2 (4PS/IRS2). are activated in IL4 signal transduction. Recent studies from STAT6-deficient mice have revealed the essential role of STAT6 in IL4-mediated biological actions. In addition. STAT6 has also been demonstrated to be important for the functions mediated by IL13. which is related to IL4. IL4 and IL13 have been shown to induce the production of IgE. which is a major mediator in an allergic response.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important inducer of these acute phase proteins at the transcriptional level. The recently cloned nuclear factor NF-IL6. a potent trans-acting regulator of IL-6 gene expression. has a region that is highly homologous to the liver-specific transcriptional factor C/EBP. Both factors recognize the same nucleotide sequence. In this study the recombinant NF-IL6 was shown to interact with the IL-6-responsive elements (IL-6REs) identified in the promoter region of several acute phase protein genes whose activity increases during the acute phase reaction. Furthermore. in competition experiments. formation of all the DNA-protein complexes by the IL-6RE and IL-6-treated hepatoma cell extracts was specifically decreased by adding either the 14-bp NF-IL6 binding motif identified in the IL-6 promoter or the antibody against the recombinant NF-IL6. NF-IL6 was expressed at a minor level in mouse liver. but was dramatically induced after stimulation with IL-6. In contrast. the amount of C/EBP mRNA decreased considerably after IL-6 stimulation.

Because of constant exposure to this fungus. it is critical for the host to exercise an immediate and decisive immune response to clear fungal spores to ward off disease. In this study. we observed that rapidly after infection by A. fumigatus. alveolar macrophages predominantly express Arginase 1 (Arg1). a key marker of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs).

While both Dectin-1 and TLR expressed on the cell surface have been shown to sense A. fumigatus. fungus-induced Arg1 expression in CD11c+ alveolar macrophages was not dependent on either Dectin-1 or the adaptor MyD88 that mediates intracellular signaling by most TLRs. Alveolar macrophages from WT mice efficiently phagocytosed fungal conidia. but those from mice deficient in Dectin-1 showed impaired fungal uptake.

RIG-like helicases (RLHs). cytosolic RNA sensors. are indispensable for antiviral responses in conventional dendritic cells. macrophages. and fibroblasts. However. the contribution of TRAF6 to the detection of cytosolic viral nucleic acids has been controversial. and the involvement of TRAF6 in IRF activation has not been adequately addressed.  Principal Findings Here we first show that TRAF6 plays a critical role in RLH signaling. The absence of TRAF6 resulted in enhanced viral replication and a significant reduction in the production of IL-6 and type I IFNs after infection with RNA virus. Activation of NF-κB and IRF7. but not that of IRF3. was significantly impaired during RLH signaling in the absence of TRAF6. TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and MEKK3. whose activation by TRAF6 during TLR signaling is involved in NF-κB activation. were not essential for RLH-mediated NF-κB activation. We also demonstrate that TRAF6-deficiency impaired cytosolic DNA-induced antiviral responses. and this impairment was due to defective activation of NF-κB and IRF7.

638,Innate immunity to pathogens: diversity in receptors for microbial recognition,2009,Shizuo Akira,227,Immunological reviews,1,5-8,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Eukaryotes are constantly exposed to the threat of microbial species including viruses. bacteria. and parasites. In mammals. the protection against invading pathogens is mediated by two different immune systems: the evolutionarily conserved innate immune system. which is essential for the first line of host defense. and the acquired immune system. which is critical for immunological memory. The acquired immune system generates a highly diverse repertoire of antigen receptors. the T and B-cell receptors. via DNA rearrangement. After encountering a pathogen. the lymphocytes bearing the appropriate high-affinity antigen receptors for that pathogen expand and eliminate the pathogens in the late stage of infection. In contrast. innate immunity discriminates self and non-self by a limited number of germline-encoded receptors. These receptors are called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). as they recognize …,True,0TG2laoAAAAJ:vCSeWdjOjw8C,107,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00739.x,1167850488776069524,/scholar?cites=1167850488776069524,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00739.x,0

Recent observations suggest that saturated fatty acids can act as a ligand for toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. which is thought to mediate obesity-associated insulin resistance. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is an adapter protein for TLR/IL-1 receptor signaling. which is involved in the activation of inflammatory pathways. To evaluate molecular mechanisms linking obesity-associated diabetes down-stream of TLR4. we investigated physiological role of MyD88 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity.  Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study. we found MyD88-deficient mice fed a HFD had increased circulating levels of insulin. leptin and cholesterol. as well as liver dysfunction (increased induction of ALT levels. increased activation of JNK and cleavage of PARP). which were linked to the onset of severe diabetes. On the other hand. TNF-α would not be involved in HFD-induced diabetes in MyD88-deficient mice. because TNF-α level was attenuated in MyD88-deficient mice fed with HFD.

Having recently reported that Leishmania and bacterial LPS generate a significantly stronger inflammatory response in animals and phagocytes functionally deficient for the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-1). we hypothesized that Leishmania could exploit SHP-1 to inactivate key kinases involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling and innate immunity such as IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1). Here we show that upon infection. SHP-1 rapidly binds to IRAK-1. completely inactivating its intrinsic kinase activity and any further LPS-mediated activation as well as MØ functions. We also demonstrate that the SHP-1/IRAK-1 interaction occurs via an evolutionarily conserved ITIM-like motif found in the kinase domain of IRAK-1. which we named KTIM (Kinase Tyrosyl-based Inhibitory Motif). This regulatory motif appeared in early vertebrates and is not found in any other IRAK family member. Our study additionally reveals that several other kinases (e.g. Erk1/2.

Activation of interleukin-1 type 1 and Toll-like receptors that share the common downstream adaptor molecule MyD88 is required for disease induction. The specific role of MyD88 in myocarditis. however. is not known. Methods and Results—In contrast to control littermates. MyD88 J/J mice were protected from myocarditis after immunization with-myosin heavy chain–derived peptide (MyHC-) and complete Freund’s adjuvant. Disease resistance of MyD88 J/J mice resulted from impaired expansion of heart-specific CD4+ T cells after immunization. Intrinsic defects of MyD88 J/J CD4+ T cells were excluded. In contrast. MyD88 J/J but not MyD88+/+ primary antigen presenting dendritic cells (DCs) were defective in their capacity to prime CD4+ T cells. This defect mainly resulted from the inability of MyD88 J/J DCs to release tumor necrosis factor-. The critical role of MyD88 signaling in DCs in the peripheral lymphatic compartments was finally proven by repetitive injection of activated. MyHC-–loaded MyD88+/+ DCs that fully restored T-cell expansion and myocarditis in MyD88 J/J mice. Conclusions—Autoimmune myocarditis induction depends on MyD88 signaling in self-antigen presenting cells in the peripheral compartments.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). an inflammatory. demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). EAE pathogenesis involves various cell types. cytokines. chemokines. and adhesion molecules. Given the complexity of the inflammatory response in EAE. it is likely that many immune mediators still remain to be discovered. To identify novel immune mediators of EAE pathogenesis. we performed an Affymetrix gene array screen on the spinal cords of mice at the onset stage of disease. This screening identified the gene encoding lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as being significantly upregulated. Lcn2 is a multi‐functional protein that plays a role in glial activation. matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) stabilization. and cellular iron flux.

TLR5 has been shown to recognize bacterial flagellin. Unlike other TLRs. TLR5 is not expressed on conventional dendritic cells or macrophages. By contrast. TLR5 is mainly expressed on intestinal CD11c+ lamina propria cells (LPCs). which do not express TLR4. These cells detect pathogenic bacteria and secreted proinflammatory cytokines. mainly in a TLR5-dependent manner. Notably. transport of pathogenic Salmonella typhimurium from the intestinal tract to mesenteric lymph nodes was impaired in Tlr5 −/− mice. suggesting that CD11c+ LPCs expressing TLR5 are used by S. typhimurium for systemic infection.

Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) has recently gained importance as one of the major host defense receptors. The increased expression of TLR2 in response to bacteria-induced cytokines has been thought to be crucial for the accelerated immune response and resensitization of epithelial cells to invading pathogens. We show that IL-1β. a key proinflammatory cytokine. greatly up-regulates TLR2 expression in human epithelial cells via a positive IKKβ-IκBα-dependent NF-κB pathway and negative MEKK1-MKK4/7-JNK1/2 and MKK3/6-p38 α/β pathways.

Using the P. berghei ANKA infection model of mice. we investigated a potential involvement of Nlrp3 and the inflammasome in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. Nlrp3 mRNA expression was upregulated in brain endothelial cells after exposure to P. berghei ANKA. Although β‐hematin. a synthetic compound of the parasites heme polymer hemozoin. induced the release of IL‐1β in macrophages through Nlrp3. we did not obtain evidence for a role of IL‐1β in vivo.

To ensure immunity rather than tolerance induction the co-administration of a suitable adjuvant is paramount. However. co-administration of unlinked adjuvant cannot ensure that all cells targeted by the antibody conjugates are appropriately activated. Furthermore. antigen-presenting cells (APC) that do not present the desired antigen are equally strongly activated and could prime undesired responses against self-antigens. We. therefore. were interested in exploring targeted co-delivery of antigen and adjuvant in cis in form of antibody-antigen-adjuvant conjugates for the induction of anti-tumour immunity.

817,Osmotic Stress Activates the TAK1-JNK Pathway While Blocking TAK1-mediated NF-κB Activation TAO2 REGULATES TAK1 PATHWAYS,2006,Wei-Chun HuangFu and Emily Omori and Shizuo Akira and Kunihiro Matsumoto and Jun Ninomiya-Tsuji,281,Journal of Biological Chemistry,39,28802-28810,American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Osmotic stress activates MAPKs. including JNK and p38. which play important roles in cellular stress responses. Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a member of the MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family and can activate JNK and p38. TAK1 can also activate IκB kinase (IKK) that leads to degradation of IκB and subsequent NF-κB activation. We found that TAK1 is essential for osmotic stress-induced activation of JNK but is not an exclusive mediator of p38 activation. Furthermore. we found that although TAK1 was highly activated upon osmotic stress. it could not induce degradation of IκB or activation of NF-κB. These results suggest that TAK1 activity is somehow modulated to function specifically in osmotic stress signaling. leading to the activation of JNK but not of IKK. To elucidate the mechanism underlying this modulation. we screened for potential TAK1-binding proteins.

Gain or loss-of-function mutations of one molecule have shown to affect alternative signaling pathways with a poorly understood mechanism. In Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling. which branches into MyD88- and TRAM-dependent pathways upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. we investigated the gain or loss-of-function mutations of MyD88. We predict. using a computational model built on the perturbation-response approach and the law of mass conservation. that removal and addition of MyD88 in TLR4 activation. enhances and impairs. respectively. the alternative TRAM-dependent pathway through signaling flux redistribution (SFR) at pathway branches. To verify SFR. we treated MyD88-deficient macrophages with LPS and observed enhancement of TRAM-dependent pathway based on increased IRF3 phosphorylation and induction of Cxcl10 and Ifit2. Furthermore. increasing the amount of MyD88 in cultured cells showed decreased TRAM binding to TLR4. Investigating another TLR4 pathway junction. from TRIF to TRAF6.

The priming effect of IFN-γ was clearly observed in the high-CD14-expressing (CD14high) HGF but not in the low-CD14-expressing (CD14low) HGF. The CD14high HGF were most effectively primed with IFN-γ (1.000 IU/ml) for 72 h.

However. signalling mechanisms that regulate satellite cell function are less understood. Here we demonstrate that transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is important in satellite stem cell homeostasis and function. Inactivation of TAK1 in satellite cells inhibits muscle regeneration in adult mice. TAK1 is essential for satellite cell proliferation and its inactivation causes precocious differentiation.

Recent studies also suggest the presence of TLR-independent responses to several microorganisms. such as viruses. bacteria. and fungi. However. the TLR-independent responses to protozoa remain unclear. Here. we demonstrate a novel TLR-independent innate response pathway to T. cruzi. Myd88−/−Trif−/− mice lacking TLR signaling showed normal T. cruzi-induced Th1 responses and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). despite high sensitivity to the infection. IFN-γ was normally induced in T. cruzi-infected Myd88−/−Trif−/− innate immune cells. and further was responsible for the TLR-independent Th1 responses and DC maturation after T. cruzi infection. T. cruzi infection induced elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ level. Furthermore. T. cruzi-induced IFN-γ expression was blocked by inhibition of Ca2+ signaling. NFATc1. which plays a pivotal role in Ca2+ signaling in lymphocytes. was activated in T. cruzi-infected Myd88−/−Trif−/− innate immune cells.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is increased in the brain after kainic acid (KA) treatment. We previously demonstrated that KA also induces PG synthase cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) expression rapidly in neurons of the brain and slowly in astrocytes and endothelia. Prevention of KA‐induced neuronal damage by nonneuronal COX‐2 inhibition suggests a novel modulatory mechanism for neuronal injury by nonneuronal PGs. It remains unclear. however. which PG synthase is responsible for this modulation following COX‐2 synthesis after neuronal insult. In addition. the PG receptor subtype that is involved in neuronal loss remains controversial. Here we demonstrate that microinjection of KA induces microsomal prostaglandin E synthase‐1 (mPGES‐1) in venous endothelial cells but not in neurons or astrocytes.

A subset of TLRs recognize viral components and induce antiviral responses by producing type I interferons. Whereas TLR2 and TLR4 recognize viral components at the cell surface. TLR3. TLR7. TLR8 and TLR9 are exclusively expressed in endosomal compartments. After phagocytes internalize viruses or virus-infected apoptotic cells. viral nucleic acids are released in phagolysosomes and are recognized by these TLRs.

FasL is a specific ligand of Fas. which is a type-I transmembrane protein to induce cell death. Previously. it has been reported that the hyper induction of gene expression associated with Fas signal is observed in lethal influenza A virus infection. More importantly. it was also reported that functional mutation of the FasL gene protects the host against influenza A virus infection. These observations suggest that induction of FasL signal is functionally associated with the severity of influenza. However. regulation of the induction of FasL or Fas by influenza A virus infection is still unknown. Here. we demonstrated that FasL is induced after the viral infection. and inhibition of the Fas/FasL signal by treatment with a recombinant decoy receptor for FasL (Fas-Fc) increases the survival rate of mice after lethal infection of influenza A virus as well as functional mutation of the FasL gene in gld/gld mice. In addition. the induction level of FasL gene expression in the lung was correlated with the severity of influenza. We also showed that a variety of types of cells in the lung express FasL after the viral infection. Furthermore. type-I interferon induced by the viral infection was shown to be critical for induction of FasL protein expression in the lung.

Innate immunity is mediated by macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). generically known as antigenpresenting cells (APCs).

Zc3h12a knockout mice develop spontaneous autoimmune diseases accompanied by splenomegaly and by lymphadenopathy. Subsequent studies show that Zc3h12a is a nuclease involved in destabilization of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12 mRNA via the stem loop structure within the 3′ UTR of these genes. Thus. we renamed it regulatory RNase-1 (Regnase-1) based on its function. IκB kinases phosphorylate and degrade Regnase-1 protein in macrophages in response to IL-1R/Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. T-cell-specific deletion of Regnase-1 produces pathogenic T cells with hyperactivated phenotypes as well as autoimmune diseases. Regnase-1 protein is cleaved by Malt1 and inactivated in response to T-cell receptor stimulation. Thus.

The mechanism by which transdifferentiation from original cell to myofibroblast occurs. however. is still unclear. The expression of smooth muscle α-actin (SMαA) is the most characteristic feature of myofibroblasts; therefore. it was speculated that any factors that promote SMαA expression might be the key to transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts and disease exacerbation. A transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ) was identified and demonstrated to bind to sequences including the CArG motif from SMαA intron 1 and to increase transcriptional activity of this promoter.

In other words. the immunobiological activity of the LTA fraction reported in the 1980s was not attributable to LTA itself. but to other glycolipids coexisting in the fraction. In the present study. we improved the procedure of separation of the active glycolipids and evaluated their effects on cellular activation. The immunobiologically active glycolipids were separated from the crude glycolipid fraction obtained by hot phenol-water extraction of the cells.

Here. we show that insulin–insulin receptor (InsR) signaling is required for lineage commitment of multipotent progenitors (MPPs). Deletion of Insr in murine bone marrow causes skewed differentiation of MPPs to myeloid cells. mTOR acts as a downstream effector that modulates MPP differentiation. mTOR activates Stat3 by phosphorylation at serine 727 under insulin stimulation. which binds to the promoter of Ikaros. leading to its transcription priming.

Mice sublingually immunized with influenza vaccine (HA split vaccine) with LPSpa induced both HA-specific IgG (systemic) and IgA (mucosal) antibody responses. which led to a significant increase in survival rate against lethal influenza virus challenge compared with subcutaneous vaccination. After sublingual administration of ovalbumin with LPSpa. ovalbumin-specific mucosal IgA responses were induced at both mucosal surfaces close to the immunized site and at remote mucosal surfaces. Sublingual administration of LPSpa evoked local antigen-uptake by dendritic cells in cervical lymph nodes.

Cells derived from mice lacking telomerase RNA component (mTERC−/− mice) display elevated telomere-mediated chromosome instability. Age-dependent telomere shortening and associated chromosome instability reduce the capacity to respond to cellular stress occurring during inflammation and cancer. Inflammation is one of the important risk factors in cancer progression. Controlled innate immune responses mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLR) are required for host defense against infection. Our aim was to understand the role of chromosome/genome instability in the initiation and maintenance of inflammation.  Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the function of TLR4 in telomerase deficient mTERC−/− mice harbouring chromosome instability which did not develop any overt immunological disorder in pathogen-free condition or any form of cancers at this stage. Chromosome instability was measured in metaphase spreads prepared from wildtype (mTERC+/+). mTERC+/− and mTERC−/− mouse splenocytes. Peritoneal and/or bone marrow-derived macrophages were used to examine the responses of TLR4 by their ability to produce inflammatory mediators TNFα and IL6. Our results demonstrate that TLR4 is highly up-regulated in the immune cells derived from telomerase-null (mTERC−/−) mice and lipopolysaccharide. a natural ligand for TLR4 stabilises NF-κB binding to its promoter by down-regulating ATF-3 in mTERC−/− macrophages.

1130,NF-κB at the crossroads of life and death,2002,Michael Karin and Anning Lin,3,Nature immunology,3,221-227,Nature Publishing Group,The choice between life and death is one of the major events in regulation of the immune system. T cells that specifically recognize viral or bacterial antigens are selected to survive and proliferate in response to infection. whereas those that are self-reactive are eliminated via apoptosis. Even the survival of alloreactive T cells requires their proper costimulation and. when infection subsides. the activated T cells are eliminated. A major regulator of such life or death decisions is the transcription factor NF-κB. However. NF-κB cannot function alone.

Footprinting analysis indicated that these TPA-responsive elements (TREs) are recognized by a common cellular protein: the previously described transcription factor AP-1. A point mutation that eliminated the basal and induced activity of the TRE also interfered with its ability to bind AP-1. Treatment of cultured cells with TPA led to a rapid 3-to 4-fold increase in TRE binding activity. by a posttranslational mechanism.

This results in sustained JNK activation. which is required for cytochrome c release and caspase 3 cleavage. as well as necrotic cell death.

This pathway depends on the IκB kinase (IKK). which contains two catalytic subunits. IKKα and IKKβ. IKKβ is essential for inducible IκB phosphorylation and degradation. whereas IKKα is not. Here we show that IKKα is required for B cell maturation. formation of secondary lymphoid organs. increased expression of certain NF-κB target genes. and processing of the NF-κB2 (p100) precursor.

Some of these cytoplasmic molecules sense microbial. as well as non-microbial. danger signals. but the mechanisms of recognition used by these sensors remain poorly understood.

These three sites are nested within a single tryptic peptide located just upstream of the basic region of the c-Jun DNA-binding domain (residues 227–252). Activation of protein kinase C results in rapid. site-specific dephosphorylation of c-Jun at one or more of these three sites and is coincident with increased AP-1-binding activity. Phosphorylation of recombinant human c-Jun proteins in vitro by GSK-3 decreases their DNA-binding activity. Mutation of serine 243 to phenylalanine blocks phosphorylation of all three sites in vivo and increases the inherent trans-activation ability of c-Jun at least 10-fold.

Better understanding of microbial pattern-recognition receptors and innate immune signaling pathways of the host is helping to elucidate the connection between microbial infection and chronic disease. We propose that a key aspect of pathogenesis is an aberrant epithelial barrier that can be instigated by microbial toxins. environmental insults. or the genetic predisposition of the host. Loss of epithelial integrity results in activation of resident inflammatory cells by microbial invaders or endogenous ligands. When coupled with a failure of normal control mechanisms that limit leukocyte activation. a cascade is established that induces chronic inflammation and its consequences.

We investigated the mechanism by which UV irradiation induces the c-jun gene. The earliest detectable step was activation of Src tyrosine kinases. followed by activation of Ha-Ras and Raf-1. The response to UV was blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors and dominant negative mutants of v-src. Ha-ras. and raf-1. This signaling cascade leads to increased phosphorylation of c-Jun on two serine residues that potentiate its activity. These results strongly suggest that the UV response is initiated at or near the plasma membrane rather than the nucleus.

1212,NF-κB as a critical link between inflammation and cancer,2009,Michael Karin,1,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,5,a000141,Cold Spring Harbor Lab,NF-κB transcription factors have been suspected to be involved in cancer development since their discovery because of their kinship with the v-Rel oncogene product. Subsequent work led to identification of oncogenic mutations that result in NF-κB activation in lymphoid malignancies. but most of these mutations affect upstream components of NF-κB signaling pathways. rather than NF-κB family members themselves. NF-κB activation has also been observed in many solid tumors. but so far no oncogenic mutations responsible for NF-κB activation in carcinomas have been identified. In such cancers. NF-κB activation is a result of underlying inflammation or the consequence of formation of an inflammatory microenvironment during malignant progression.

Because several previously identified UV-inducible genes contain AP-1 binding sites within their promoters. we investigated the induction of AP-1 activity by DNA-damaging agents. We found that expression of both c-jun and c-fos. which encode proteins that participate in formation of the AP-1 complex. is rapidly induced by two different DNA-damaging agents: UV and H2O2. Interestingly. the c-jun gene is far more responsive to UV than any other immediate-early gene that was examined. including c-fos. Other jun and fos genes were only marginally affected by UV or H2O2. Furthermore. UV is a much more efficient inducer of c-jun than phorbol esters. the standard inducers of c-jun expression.

An important property of TGF-beta 1 is its ability to activate its own mRNA expression and thereby increase its own secretion. Two distinct regions of the promoter of the TGF-beta 1 gene are responsive to autoregulation: one 59 to the upstream transcriptional start site and another located between the two major start sites. In both promoter regions. autoinduction is mediated by binding of the AP-1 (Jun-Fos) complex. An important contribution to this positive regulation is the autoactivation of c-jun transcription by AP-1.

1223,Regulation and function of the JNK subgroup of MAP kinases,1997,Audrey Minden and Michael Karin,1333,,2,F85-F104,Elsevier,Mammalian cells respond to extracellular stimuli by activating signaling cascades that are mediated by members of the MAP kinase family. MAP kinases act by phosphorylating various substrates including transcription factors. These in turn regulate expression of specific sets of genes and thus can mediate a specific genetic response to the stimulus. The basic organization of signaling pathways leading to MAP kinase activation is highly conserved from yeast to mammalian cells. Several subgroups of MAP kinases were identified in mammalian cells. which differ in their substrate specificities and regulation. Members of the JNK subgroup of MAP kinases are activated in response to diverse extracellular stimuli. including UV irradiation. proinflammatory cytokines and certain mitogens. The JNKs phosphorylate specific sites on the amino terminal trans-activation domain of transcription factor c-Jun. an important component of transcriptional activator AP-1. Phosphorylation of these sites stimulates the ability of c-Jun to activate transcription of specific target genes. In addition to c-Jun. the JNKs phosphorylate and activate several other transcription factors. most of which can contribute to AP-1 activity. This review provides an overview of MAP kinase activation. with particular emphasis on the signal transduction pathways leading to activation of the JNK subgroup of MAP kinases.

Consistent with this. mice lacking the SHP gene exhibit mild defects in bile acid homeostasis and fail to repress cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase expression in response to a specific agonist for the bile acid receptor FXR. However. this repression is retained in SHP null mice fed bile acids. demonstrating the existence of compensatory repression pathways of bile acid signaling.

Ltd,It has been postulated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may act as second messengers leading to nuclear factor (NF)‐κB activation. This hypothesis is mainly based on the findings that N‐acetyl‐L‐cysteine (NAC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). compounds recognized as potential antioxidants. can inhibit NF‐κB activation in a wide variety of cell types. Here we reveal that both NAC and PDTC inhibit NF‐κB activation independently of antioxidative function. NAC selectively blocks tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐induced signaling by lowering the affinity of receptor to TNF. PDTC inhibits the IκB–ubiquitin ligase activity in the cell‐free system where extracellular stimuli‐regulated ROS production does not occur.

IL-2 mRNA contains at least two cis elements that mediated its stabilization in response to different signals. including activation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK). This response was mediated through a cis element encompassing the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and the beginning of the coding region. IL-2 transcripts lacking this 5′ element no longer responded to JNK activation but were still responsive to other signals generated during T cell activation. which were probably sensed through the 3′ UTR.

Extensive epidemiological studies reveal a strong link between obesity and development and progression of various types of cancers. The connection between obesity and liver cancer is particularly strong and obesity often results in liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is characterized by fatty liver inflammation and is believed to cause fibrosis and cirrhosis. The latter is a known liver cancer risk factor. In fact due to its much higher prevalence obesity may be a more substantial contributor to overall hepatocellular carcinoma burden than infection with hepatitis viruses.

We demonstrate that the decreased ability of JunB to activate gene expression is the result of a small number of amino acid changes between its DNA-binding and dimerization motifs and the corresponding regions of c-Jun. These changes lead to a 10-fold decrease in the DNA-binding activity of JunB. JunB can be converted into a c-Jun-like activator by substituting four amino acids in its DNA-binding and dimerization motifs with the corresponding c-Jun sequences.

Induction of a protooncogene. normally involved in mitogenic responses. by a genotoxic agent that causes growth arrest seems paradoxical.

Cyclosporin A. an inhibitor of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin which blocks IL-2 induction. abrogates Ca2+-triggered synergistic JNK activation. As protein kinase C (PKC) downregulation inhibits PMA+ionophoreinduced JNK activation. we examined whether a particular PKC isoform is preferentially involved in this response. We found that PKC-θ but neither PKC-α nor PKC-ε participates in JNK activation. whereas all three PKCs lead to ERK MAPK activation.

Fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1. also called S100A4) is considered a marker of fibroblasts in different organs undergoing tissue remodeling and is used to identify fibroblasts derived from EMT in several organs including the liver. The aim of this study was to characterize FSP1-positive cells in human and experimental liver disease. FSP1-positive cells were increased in human and mouse experimental liver injury including liver cancer. However. FSP1 was not expressed by HSC or type I collagen-producing fibroblasts. Likewise.

IL-1 induces T lymphocyte growth by acting as a second signal (together with antigen) in enhancing the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2). An IL-1-responsive element in the promoter region of the human IL-2 gene was similar to the binding site for the transcription factor AP-1. IL-1 enhanced expression of c-jun messenger RNA. whereas the antigenic signal enhanced messenger RNA expression of c-fos.

To understand the structure and regulation of this important gene. a genomic clone of human JUN was isolated and its primary structure and transcription pattern were determined. Most surprisingly. the sequence of the genomic clone was found to be contiguous with the sequence of the JUN cDNA. suggesting that it lacks introns. RNase protection experiments confirm that JUN is an intronless gene that yields several transcripts due to 59 and 39 heterogeneities. Transfection experiments show that the cloned gene is functional. as it encodes a trans-acting factor that stimulates transcription of AP-1-dependent reporter gene.

We show that the yeast S. cerevisiae has a remarkably similar UV response involving the AP-1 factor Gcn4. which is distinct from the DNA damage response. Transcriptional activation of HIS3 and HIS4 by Gcn4 is triggered by UV irradiation in a Rasdependent fashion. Moreover. resistance of yeast to UV irradiation is correlated with the level of Ras activity and Gcn4 function. Like mammalian cells in which activated Ras leads to increased c&n synthesis and phosphorylation. the effects in yeast involve increased translation of GCN4 mRNA and a posttranslational event.

MAPK kinase (MAPKK). and a MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK). Despite the existence of numerous components and ample opportunities for crosstalk. most MAPKs are specifically and distinctly activated. We investigated the basis for specific activation of the JNK subgroup of MAPKs. The specificity of JNK activation is determined by the MAPKK JNKK1. which interacts with the MAPKKK MEKK1 and JNK through its amino-terminal extension. Inactive JNKK1 mutants can disrupt JNK activation by MEKK1 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in intact cells only if they contain an intact amino-terminal extension.

Furthermore. concomitant ablation of Sesn2 and Sesn3 provokes hepatic mTORC1-S6K activation and insulin resistance even in the …,True,xVvyb1gAAAAJ:wKETBy42zhYC,202,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413112003269,6439458628034367898,/scholar?cites=6439458628034367898,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413112003269,0
1416,TNFR signaling: ubiquitin‐conjugated TRAFfic signals control stop‐and‐go for MAPK signaling complexes,2009,Michael Karin and Ewen Gallagher,228,Immunological reviews,1,225-240,Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Nearly two decades after the initial cloning and identification of the founding father of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. much has been learned about the mechanisms by which these receptors signal to critical transcription factors and other targets that regulate gene expression and cellular physiology. Mitogen‐activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)‐κB (IκB) kinases (IKKs) were identified early on as the upstream kinases responsible for activation of activator‐protein 1 (AP‐1) and NF‐κB. respectively. and later on for their ability to control life‐or‐death decisions in TNF‐stimulated cells. Both of these critical pathways are regulated at the level of MAPK kinase kinases (MAP3Ks). after which point they diverge. Recent work. however. illustrates that protein ubiquitination cascades play a critical initiating role in TNFR signaling and account for spatial and temporal separation …,True,xVvyb1gAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC,202,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00755.x,3129201255273653616,/scholar?cites=3129201255273653616,,http://www.academia.edu/download/47703411/j.1600-065x.2008.00755.x20160801-18757-v30u1x.pdf,0

1418,Targeting of TAK1 by the NF-κB protein Relish regulates the JNK-mediated immune response in Drosophila,2004,Jin Mo Park and Helen Brady and Maria Grazia Ruocco and Huaiyu Sun and DeeAnn Williams and Susan J Lee and Tomohisa Kato and Normand Richards and Kyle Chan and Frank Mercurio and Michael Karin and Steven A Wasserman,18,Genes & development,5,584-594,Cold Spring Harbor Lab,The molecular circuitry underlying innate immunity is constructed of multiple. evolutionarily conserved signaling modules with distinct regulatory targets. The MAP kinases and the IKK-NF-κB molecules play important roles in the initiation of immune effector responses. We have found that the Drosophila NF-κB protein Relish plays a crucial role in limiting the duration of JNK activation and output in response to Gram-negative infections. Relish activation is linked to proteasomal degradation of TAK1. the upstream MAP kinase kinase kinase required for JNK activation. Degradation of TAK1 leads to a rapid termination of JNK signaling. resulting in a transient JNK-dependent response that precedes the sustained induction of Relish-dependent innate immune loci. Because the IKK-NF-κB module also negatively regulates JNK activation in mammals. thereby controlling inflammation-induced apoptosis. the regulatory cross …,True,xVvyb1gAAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC,201,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/18/5/584.short,11918075458574283568,/scholar?cites=11918075458574283568,,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/18/5/584.full.pdf,0
1419,ATM is required for IκB kinase (IKK) activation in response to DNA double strand breaks,2001,Nanxin Li and Sharon Banin and Honghai Ouyang and Gloria C Li and Gilles Courtois and Yosef Shiloh and Michael Karin and Galit Rotman,276,Journal of Biological Chemistry,12,8898-8903,American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Following challenge with proinflammatory stimuli or generation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). transcription factor NF-κB translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to activate expression of target genes. In addition. NF-κB plays a key role in protecting cells from proapoptotic stimuli. including DSBs. Patients suffering from the genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia. caused by mutations in theATM gene. are highly sensitive to inducers of DSBs. such as ionizing radiation. Similar hypersensitivity is displayed by cell lines derived from ataxia-telangiectasia patients orAtm knockout mice. The ATM protein. a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like family. is a multifunctional protein kinase whose activity is stimulated by DSBs. As both ATM and NF-κB deficiencies result in increased sensitivity to DSBs. we examined the role of ATM in NF-κB activation. We report that ATM is essential for NF-κB …,True,xVvyb1gAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC,200,https://www.jbc.org/content/276/12/8898.short,3205475362655475224,/scholar?cites=3205475362655475224,,https://www.jbc.org/content/276/12/8898.full.pdf,0

Recent studies of genetically engineered mice have clearly indicated that NF-κB is also required for proper organogenesis of several epithelial tissues. including the mammary gland. Mice have shown severe lactation deficiency when NF-κB activation is specifically blocked in the mammary gland. In addition. there are strong suggestions that NF-κB may play an important role in the etiology of breast cancer. Elevated NF-κB DNA-binding activity is detected in both mammary carcinoma cell lines and primary human breast cancer tissues.,True,xVvyb1gAAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C,198,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1025905008934,2913592373546491013,/scholar?cites=2913592373546491013,,,0
