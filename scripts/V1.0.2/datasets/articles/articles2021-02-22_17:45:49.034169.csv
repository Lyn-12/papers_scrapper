1045093,A renaissance in RNA synthetic biology: new mechanisms. applications and tools for the future,2015,James Chappell and Kyle E Watters and Melissa K Takahashi and Julius B Lucks,28,,,47-56,Elsevier Current Trends,Since our ability to engineer biological systems is directly related to our ability to control gene expression. a central focus of synthetic biology has been to develop programmable genetic regulatory systems. Researchers are increasingly turning to RNA regulators for this task because of their versatility. and the emergence of new powerful RNA design principles. Here we review advances that are transforming the way we use RNAs to engineer biological systems. First. we examine new designable RNA mechanisms that are enabling large libraries of regulators with protein-like dynamic ranges. Next. we review emerging applications. from RNA genetic circuits to molecular diagnostics. Finally. we describe new experimental and computational tools that promise to accelerate our understanding of RNA folding. function and design.,True,a6otEBcAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,111,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593115000514,11517303077359414962,/scholar?cites=11517303077359414962,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593115000514,0,0,0
1045094,SHAPE-Seq 2.0: systematic optimization and extension of high-throughput chemical probing of RNA secondary structure with next generation sequencing,2014,David Loughrey and Kyle E Watters and Alexander H Settle and Julius B Lucks,42,Nucleic acids research,21,e165-e165,Oxford University Press,RNA structure is a primary determinant of its function. and methods that merge chemical probing with next generation sequencing have created breakthroughs in the throughput and scale of RNA structure characterization. However. little work has been done to examine the effects of library preparation and sequencing on the measured chemical probe reactivities that encode RNA structural information. Here. we present the first analysis and optimization of these effects for selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-Seq). We first optimize SHAPE-Seq. and show that it provides highly reproducible reactivity data over a wide range of RNA structural contexts with no apparent biases. As part of this optimization. we present SHAPE-Seq v2.0. a ‘universal’ method that can obtain reactivity information for every nucleotide of an RNA without having to use or introduce a specific …,True,a6otEBcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,110,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/42/21/e165/2903199,2256717456293182547,/scholar?cites=2256717456293182547,,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/42/21/e165/2903199,0,0,0
1045095,Systematic discovery of natural CRISPR-Cas12a inhibitors,2018,Kyle E Watters and Christof Fellmann and Hua B Bai and Shawn M Ren and Jennifer A Doudna,362,Science,6411,236-239,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Cas12a (Cpf1) is a CRISPR-associated nuclease with broad utility for synthetic genome engineering. agricultural genomics. and biomedical applications. Although bacteria harboring CRISPR-Cas9 or CRISPR-Cas3 adaptive immune systems sometimes acquire mobile genetic elements encoding anti-CRISPR proteins that inhibit Cas9. Cas3. or the DNA-binding Cascade complex. no such inhibitors have been found for CRISPR-Cas12a. Here we use a comprehensive bioinformatic and experimental screening approach to identify three different inhibitors that block or diminish CRISPR-Cas12a–mediated genome editing in human cells. We also find a widespread connection between CRISPR self-targeting and inhibitor prevalence in prokaryotic genomes. suggesting a straightforward path to the discovery of many more anti-CRISPRs from the microbial world.,True,a6otEBcAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,96,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6411/236.abstract,9959175507056176256,/scholar?cites=9959175507056176256,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6185749/,0,0,0
1045096,Cotranscriptional folding of a riboswitch at nucleotide resolution,2016,Kyle E Watters and Eric J Strobel and M Yu Angela and John T Lis and Julius B Lucks,23,Nature structural & molecular biology,12,1124,Nature Publishing Group,RNAs can begin to fold immediately as they emerge from RNA polymerase. During cotranscriptional folding. interactions between nascent RNAs and ligands are able to direct the formation of alternative RNA structures. a feature exploited by noncoding RNAs called riboswitches to make gene-regulatory decisions. Despite their importance. cotranscriptional folding pathways have yet to be uncovered with sufficient resolution to reveal how cotranscriptional folding governs RNA structure and function. To access cotranscriptional folding at nucleotide resolution. we extended selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer-extension sequencing (SHAPE-seq) to measure structural information of nascent RNAs during transcription. Using cotranscriptional SHAPE-seq. we determined how the cotranscriptional folding pathway of the Bacillus cereus crcB fluoride riboswitch undergoes a ligand-dependent bifurcation that …,True,a6otEBcAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,92,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb.3316.pdf?origin=ppub,16464863678857848518,/scholar?cites=16464863678857848518,,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5497173/?text=The+fate+of+the+fluoride+bound+crcB+aptamer+is+also+distinct+from+the+fate+of+the+adenine+bound+pbuE+aptamer,+which+rearranges+into+an+aptamer+disrupted+structure+following+antitermination.",0,0,0
1045097,Simultaneous characterization of cellular RNA structure and function with in-cell SHAPE-Seq,2016,Kyle E Watters and Timothy R Abbott and Julius B Lucks,44,Nucleic acids research,2,e12-e12,Oxford University Press,Many non-coding RNAs form structures that interact with cellular machinery to control gene expression. A central goal of molecular and synthetic biology is to uncover design principles linking RNA structure to function to understand and engineer this relationship. Here we report a simple. high-throughput method called in-cell SHAPE-Seq that combines in-cell probing of RNA structure with a measurement of gene expression to simultaneously characterize RNA structure and function in bacterial cells. We use in-cell SHAPE-Seq to study the structure–function relationship of two RNA mechanisms that regulate translation in Escherichia coli. We find that nucleotides that participate in RNA–RNA interactions are highly accessible when their binding partner is absent and that changes in RNA structure due to RNA–RNA interactions can be quantitatively correlated to changes in gene expression. We also characterize …,True,a6otEBcAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,76,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/44/2/e12/2468190,10404160473691764308,/scholar?cites=10404160473691764308,,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/44/2/e12/2468190,0,0,0
1045098,The centrality of RNA for engineering gene expression,2013,James Chappell and Melissa K Takahashi and Sarai Meyer and David Loughrey and Kyle E Watters and Julius Lucks,8,,12,1379-1395,WILEY‐VCH Verlag,Synthetic biology holds promise as both a framework for rationally engineering biological systems and a way to revolutionize how we fundamentally understand them. Essential to realizing this promise is the development of strategies and tools to reliably and predictably control and characterize sophisticated patterns of gene expression. Here we review the role that RNA can play towards this goal and make a case for why this versatile. designable. and increasingly characterizable molecule is one of the most powerful substrates for engineering gene expression at our disposal. We discuss current natural and synthetic RNA regulators of gene expression acting at key points of control – transcription. mRNA degradation. and translation. We also consider RNA structural probing and computational RNA structure predication tools as a way to study RNA structure and ultimately function. Finally. we discuss how next …,True,a6otEBcAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,71,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/biot.201300018,18185585708952262184,/scholar?cites=18185585708952262184,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/biot.201300018,0,0,0
