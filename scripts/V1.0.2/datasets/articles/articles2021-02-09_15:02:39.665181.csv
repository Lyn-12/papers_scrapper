103827,Cyclooxygenases: structural. cellular. and molecular biology,2000,William L Smith and David L DeWitt and R Michael Garavito,69,,1,145-182,Annual Reviews,The prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases-1 and 2 (PGHS-1 and PGHS-2; also cyclooxygenases-1 and 2. COX-1 and COX-2) catalyze the committed step in prostaglandin synthesis. PGHS-1 and 2 are of particular interest because they are the major targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including aspirin. ibuprofen. and the new COX-2 inhibitors. Inhibition of the PGHSs with NSAIDs acutely reduces inflammation. pain. and fever. and long-term use of these drugs reduces fatal thrombotic events. as well as the development of colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease. In this review. we examine how the structures of these enzymes relate mechanistically to cyclooxygenase and peroxidase catalysis. and how differences in the structure of PGHS-2 confer on this isozyme differential sensitivity to COX-2 inhibitors. We further examine the evidence for independent signaling by PGHS-1 and …,True,d2IO63sAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3214,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.145,18290559694242783583,/scholar?cites=18290559694242783583,,http://education.expasy.org/cours/Outreach/Chimiscope/Publication/annurev.biochem.cyclooxygenases.pdf,0,0,0

Before 1991. only one PGHS had been described. the isozyme now called PGHS-1. COX-1 (for cyclooxygenase-1) or the constitutive enzyme. At that time Simmons and Herschman and their colleagues discovered mRNAs whose expression was induced in chicken and mouse fibroblasts in response to src and tumor-promoting phorbol esters. respectively. and which encoded proteins having 60% amino acid sequence identity with PGHS-1. Subsequent work has shown that the new protein. called PGHS-2. COX-2 or the inducible isoform. is very similar to PGHS-1 in structure but differs substantially from PGHS-1 with respect to its pattern of expression and its biology. The reason for the existence of the two PGHS isozymes is unknown. However. PGHS-1 and-2 are often coexpressed in the same cell and may act as parts of separate prostanoid biosynthetic systems that function somewhat independently to channel prostanoids to the extracellular milieu and the nucleus. respectively. PGHS-1 and-2 are interesting in the context of both structural biology and enzymology in that they are homodimeric. heme-containing. glycosylated proteins with two catalytic sites. Moreover. the enzymes have a novel mechanism for membrane attachment; they are anchored to one leaflet of the lipid bilayer through the hydrophobic surfaces of amphipathic helices rather than through transmembrane motifs typical of many integral membrane proteins.

The first step in prostaglandin synthesis involves enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid. which is catalyzed by prostaglandin H(PGH) synthase. also referred to as cyclooxygenase. We have cloned an inducible form of this enzyme from rat brain that is nearly identical to a murine. mitogen-inducible cyclooxygenase identified from fibroblasts. Our studies indicate that this gene. here termed COX-2. is expressed throughout the forebrain in discrete populations of neurons and is enriched in the cortex and hippocampus. Neuronal expression is rapidly and transiently induced by seizures or NMDA-dependent synaptic activity. No expression is detected in glia or vascular endothelial cells.

NSAIDs block the cyclooxygenase activities of the closely related PGH synthase-1 and PGH synthase-2 (PGHS-1 and PGHS-2) isozymes. NSAIDs are therapeutically useful due to their analgesic. anti-pyretic. anti-inflammatory. and anti-thrombogenic properties. Major side-effects of NSAIDs include their ulcerogenic and nephrotoxic activities. All clinically approved NSAIDs in general use today inhibit both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2. Recently. inhibitors have been identified that are selective toward PGHS-2 and that have potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities with minimal ulcerogenic activity. If the new PGHS-2 selective NSAIDs can effectively inhibit inflammatory prostaglandin synthesis by PGHS-2. without inhibiting PGHS-1 prostaglandin synthesis required to regulate sodium and water resorption. and renal blood flow. it is likely that these new drugs will also have significantly less renal toxicity than present-day NSAIDs.

Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the rate‐limiting step in the synthesis of prostaglandins and exists in two isoforms. Regulation of the inducible isoform. cyclooxygenase 2. is thought to play a key role in the brain's response to acute inflammatory stimuli.

103847,PGH synthase isoenzyme selectivity: the potential for safer nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs,1993,David L DeWitt and Elizabeth A Meade and William L Smith,95,,2,S40-S44,Elsevier,With the recent cloning of a second gene coding for the prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase (cyclooxygenase). it has become obvious that mammalian cells contain two related. but unique. isozymes of PGH synthase. Both of these isozymes catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2. leading to production of biologically active prostaglandins. Although the first of these isozymes. PGH synthase-1 (PGHS-1). has long been thought to be the primary and sole site of action of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). it is now known that the second isozyme. PGH synthase-2 (PGHS-2). is also sensitive to NSAIDs.

WI-38. with interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) results in a large increase in the production of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).

The glucocorticoid. dexamethasone. blocks the IL-1 alpha-mediated increases in both cPLA2 and PGE2 without affecting the cyclooxygenase level.

In this study. A. leptopus tea. prepared from the dried aerial parts. was evaluated for lipid peroxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzyme inhibitory activities. The tea as a dried extract inhibited LPO. COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes by 78%. 38% and 89%. respectively. at 100               𝜇           g/mL. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the extract yielded a selective COX-2 enzyme inhibitory phenolic aldehyde. 2.3.4-trihydroxy benzaldehyde. Also. it showed LPO inhibitory activity by 68.3% at 6.25               𝜇           g/mL. Therefore. we have studied other hydroxy benzaldehydes and their methoxy analogs for LPO.

The analogs showed only marginal LPO activity at 6.25               𝜇           g/mL. The hydroxy analogs 6. 7 and 9 showed 55%. 61% and 43% of COX-2 inhibition at 100               𝜇           g/mL. However. hydroxy benzaldehydes 3 and 12 showed selective COX-1 inhibition while compounds 4 and 10 gave little or no COX-2 enzyme inhibition at 100               𝜇           g/mL. At the same concentration. compounds 14. 21 and 22 inhibited COX-1 by 83. 85 and 70%. respectively.

There are two PGHS isozymes-PcHs-l and PGHS-Z-which are encoded by separate genes. Both enzymes catalyze formation of PGH2 from arachidonic acid. The enzymes are similar structurally and exhibit quite similar kinetic properties. Both PGHS-I and PGHS-2 arc inhibited by. common nonsteroidal anti-inflam-matory drugs (NSAIDs). PGHS-1 is generally considered to be a constitutive enzyme. Its expression is regulated developmentally. PGHS-2 is the inducible isozyme; it is expressed transiently in response to growth factors. tumor promoters.? rd cytokines. PGHS-I and PGHS-2 appeu to function at least somewhat independently.

Boston. MA,It is clear from studies conducted in a number of laboratories that the biosynthesis of prostaglandins in the kidney is compartmentalized (Fig. 1). Compartmentalization of synthesis is apparently associated with compartmentalization of function. For example. in the renal tubule there is evidence that prostaglandins are formed by the thin limb of Henle’s loop. at least in the hydronephrotic rabbit kidney.1 by the thick ascending limb.2 and by the cortical and medullary collecting tubules.3–6 and that prostaglandins affect ion or water transport7–9 and/or adenylate cyclase activities10.11 in each of these regions of the tubule. Thus one of the major goals of studies on renal prostaglandin biochemistry has been that of localization—to define which cells form prostaglandins. to determine which of the active prostaglandin derivatives are formed by each of these cells. and. finally. to determine the site and mechanism of …,True,d2IO63sAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC,8,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-4277-9_3,12771584978242285646,/scholar?cites=12771584978242285646,,,0,0,0

103946,Cyclooxygenase inhibitors,2001,William L Smith and David L De Witt,,Therapeutic Immunology. Massachusettes: Blackwell Science,,117-31,,Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the cyclooxygenase activities of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases (PGHSs). thereby blocking the biosynthesis of prostanoids (Fig. 8-1)(1-10). Prostanoids are oxygenated fatty acids most commonly derived from arachidonic acid and include the prostaglandins and thromboxanes (11. 12). There are two PGHS isozymes. which are properly called PGH synthase-1 and-2 (PGHS-1 and PGHS-2) but are also known as cyclooxygenase-1 and-2 (COX-1 and COX-2). Both isozymes are capable of catalyzing the first step in prostanoid biosynthesis. In intact cells. prostanoid biosynthesis occurs in three stages (see Fig. 8-1)(11): 1) release of arachidonic acid from phospholipid precursors catalyzed by various phospholipase A2s (13-15); 2) oxygenation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (PGH2) catalyzed by PGHSs; and 3) conversion of PGH2 to a biologically active end product (PGD2. PGE2. PGF2a. prostacyclin (PGI2) or thromboxane A2 (TXA2) through the action of a synthase or reductase (12). Newly synthesized prostanoids can exit the parent cell. probably by carrier-mediated diffusion (16) and then act locally on the parent (autocrine) and/or neighboring (paracrine) cells through G protein-linked receptors (17-21). Alternatively. prostanoids may interact with nuclear receptors that are transcription factors. such as the peroxisomal proliferator activating receptors (PPAR)(22. 23). NSAIDs exhibit a variety of pharmacologic activities. They are antipyretic. analgesic. anti-inflammatory. and antithrombogenic. In addition. NSAIDs appear to diminish the incidence of colon cancer …,True,d2IO63sAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC,6,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4111879943113037690&hl=en&oi=scholarr,4111879943113037690,/scholar?cites=4111879943113037690,,,0,0,0

Point mutations of EZH2 at Tyr641 and Ala677 occur in subpopulations of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. where they drive H3K27 hypertrimethylation.

Histone H3K27 trimethylation is a mechanism for suppressing transcription of specific genes that are proximal to the site of histone modification. Point mutations of the EZH2 gene (Tyr641) have been reported to be linked to subsets of human B-cell lymphoma. The mutant allele is always found associated with a wild-type allele (heterozygous) in disease cells. and the mutations were reported to ablate the enzymatic activity of the PRC2 complex for methylating an unmodified peptide substrate.

While traditional in vitro methods view drug–target interactions exclusively in terms of equilibrium affinity. the residence time model takes into account the conformational dynamics of target macromolecules that affect drug binding and dissociation.

Ispinesib is the first potent. highly specific small-molecule inhibitor of KSP tested for the treatment of human disease. This novel anticancer agent causes mitotic arrest and growth inhibition in several human tumor cell lines and is currently being tested in multiple phase II clinical trials. In this study we have used steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic assays to define the mechanism of KSP inhibition by ispinesib. Our data show that ispinesib alters the ability of KSP to bind to microtubules and inhibits its movement by preventing the release of ADP without preventing the release of the KSP−ADP complex from the microtubule. This type of inhibition is consistent with the physiological effect of ispinesib on cells. which is to prevent KSP-driven mitotic …,True,H7I-BtcAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,122,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi702061g,2136926287449970522,/scholar?cites=2136926287449970522,,,0,0,0

During hit and lead characterization. one sometimes observes apparently linear progress curves after jump dilution that display activity recoveries that are intermediate between those expected for fully reversible and irreversible inhibition. Computer simulations of progress curves after jump dilution indicate that seemingly linear progress curves can result when dealing with tight-binding inhibitors if substoichiometric concentrations of inhibitor are preincubated with enzyme. In this situation. the activity recovered is comparable to that expected for instantaneously reversible inhibitors. In addition. simulations demonstrate that intermediate values of activity recovery may be observed for compounds with modestly slow dissociation rates (i.e.. residence times >0 min but ⩽20 …,True,H7I-BtcAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,67,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000326971100337X,2733825431108788088,/scholar?cites=2733825431108788088,,,0,0,0

We report here that combining EPZ-6438 with CHOP in preclinical cell culture and mouse models results in dramatic synergy for cell killing in EZH2 mutant germinal center NHL cells. Surprisingly. we observe that much of this synergy is due to Prednisolone – a glucocorticoid receptor agonist (GRag) component of CHOP.

In non-stimulated cells NFκB is anchored in the cytoplasm via the inhibitory protein IκBα. Following exposure to diverse pro-inflammatory signals (eg TNFα. IL1. LPS) various signal transduction cascades are initiated converging on the IκB kinase (IKK). IKK phosphorylates IκBα on serines 32 and 36 signaling the inhibitory protein for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The SCF β-TRCP complex is the ubiquitin ligase responsible for mediating phosphorylation dependent ubiquitination of IκBα. Here we reconstitute phosphorylation dependent ubiquitination of IκBα using recombinant components. Our results suggest that the cullin specificity of the SCF complex may reflect its ability to associate with Rbx1. We demonstrate specific ubiquitination of IκBα by Ubc3 and Ubc4 in a phosphorylation and SCF β-TRCP dependent manner and that …,True,H7I-BtcAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C,51,https://www.nature.com/articles/1203647,7337074171656252405,/scholar?cites=7337074171656252405,,https://www.nature.com/articles/1203647,0,0,0

No changes in the CD spectra were observed upon ligand binding. nor did the degree of tryptophan fluorescence quenching change significantly in the complexes. These data argue against any large-scale changes in protein secondary or tertiary structure accompanying ligand binding. The change in tyrosine fluorescence intensity was used to determine the dissociation constants for the heparin and phytic acid complexes of arrestin. The only change observed was a saturable diminution of tyrosine fluorescence signal from the protein. For both ligands. the data suggest two distinct binding interactions with the protein—a …,True,H7I-BtcAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC,23,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026311832660,15692839979158803829,/scholar?cites=15692839979158803829,,,0,0,0

Robust ATP hydrolysis is catalyzed by phosphorylated MEK in the absence of the protein substrate ERK. This ERK-uncoupled ATPase activity is dependent on the phosphorylation status of MEK and is abrogated by the selective MEK kinase inhibitor U0126. ADP production is concomitant with Raf-mediated phosphorylation of MEK. Based on this finding. a coupled Raf/MEK assay is developed for measuring the Raf activity.

104164,Cytochrome c binding affects the conformation of cytochrome a in cytochrome c oxidase.,1992,Stephen R Lynch and David Sherman and Robert A Copeland,267,Journal of Biological Chemistry,1,298-302,Elsevier,Second derivative absorption spectroscopy has been used to assess the effects of complex formation between cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase on the conformation of the cytochrome a cofactor. When ferrocytochrome c is complexed to the cyanide-inhibited reduced or mixed valence enzyme. the conformation of ferrocytochrome a is affected. The second derivative spectrum of these enzyme forms displays two electronic transitions at 443 and 451 nm before complex formation. but only the 443-nm transition after cytochrome c is bound. This effect is not induced by poly-L-lysine. a homopolypeptide which is known to bind to the cytochrome c binding domain of cytochrome c oxidase. The effect is limited to cyanide-inhibited forms of the enzyme; no effect was observed for the fully reduced unliganded or fully reduced carbon monoxide-inhibited enzyme.
