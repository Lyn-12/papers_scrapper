Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication. followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications. giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25.498 genes encoding proteins from 11.000 families. similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans-the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families. indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the first complete genome sequence of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of conserved processes in all eukaryotes. identifying a wide range of plant-specific gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to identify genes for crop improvement.,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:8wCixH_E2vEC,9489,https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/analysis-of-the-genome-sequence-of-the-flowering-plant-arabidopsi,5257361017467319203,/scholar?cites=5257361017467319203,,https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/analysis-of-the-genome-sequence-of-the-flowering-plant-arabidopsi,0

Essentially. all of this biofuel was produced from crops developed for food production. raising concerns about the net energy and greenhouse gas effects and potential competition between use of land for production of fuels. food. animal feed. fiber. and ecosystem services. The pending implementation of improved technologies to more effectively convert the nonedible parts of plants (lignocellulose) to liquid fuels opens diverse options to use biofuel feedstocks that reach beyond current crops and the land currently used for food and feed.

50371,Insensitivity to ethylene conferred by a dominant mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana,1988,Anthony B Bleecker and Mark A Estelle and Chris Somerville and Hans Kende,241,Science,4869,1086-1089,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Ethylene influences a number of developmental processes and responses to stress in higher plants. The molecular basis for the action of ethylene was investigated in mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana that have altered responses to ethylene. One mutant line. which has a dominant mutation at a locus designated etr. lacks a number of responses to ethylene that are present in the wild-type plant. These include inhibition of cell elongation. promotion of seed germination. enhancement of peroxidase activity. acceleration of leaf senescence. and feedback suppression of ethylene synthesis by ethylene. These diverse responses. which occur in different tissues of Arabidopsis. appear to share some common element in their transduction pathways—for example. a single receptor for ethylene. Results of ethylene binding experiments in vivo indicate that this receptor may be affected by the etr mutation.,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1128,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/241/4869/1086.abstract,14712694278199682719,/scholar?cites=14712694278199682719,,,0

The complexes move through the plasma membrane during cellulose synthesis in directions that coincide with the orientation of microtubules. Recent. simultaneous. live-cell imaging of cellulose synthase and microtubules indicates that the microtubules exert a direct influence on the orientation of cellulose deposition.

The library was introduced en masse into Arabidopsis by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Fluorescence imaging of 5.700 transgenic plants indicated that ≈2% of lines expressed a fusion protein with a different subcellular distribution than that of soluble GFP. About half of the markers identified were targeted to peroxisomes or other subcellular destinations by non-native coding sequence (i.e.. out-of-frame cDNAs).

50380,Collapsed xylem phenotype of Arabidopsis identifies mutants deficient in cellulose deposition in the secondary cell wall.,1997,Simon R Turner and Chris R Somerville,9,The plant cell,5,689-701,American Society of Plant Biologists,Recessive mutations at three loci cause the collapse of mature xylem cells in inflorescence stems of Arabidopsis. These irregular xylem (irx) mutations were identified by screening plants from a mutagenized population by microscopic examination of stem sections. The xylem cell defect was associated with an up to eightfold reduction in the total amount of cellulose in mature inflorescence stems. The amounts of cell wall-associated phenolics and polysaccharides were unaffected by the mutations. Examination of the cell walls by using electron microscopy demonstrated that the decreases in cellulose content of irx lines resulted in an alteration of the spatial organization of cell wall material. This suggests that a normal pattern of cellulose deposition may be required for assembly of lignin or polysaccharides. The reduced cellulose content of the stems also resulted in a decrease in stiffness of the stem material.

We have used this approach to identify a large family of genes of unknown function that show sequence similarity to cellulose synthase. Our working hypothesis is that these genes encode enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of non-cellulosic polysaccharides (Cutler and Somerville. 1997).A recent breakthrough in research concerning the biogenesis of plant cell walls was the identification. by genomic methods. of genes encoding cellulose synthase in cotton fibers (Pear et al.. 1996; Delmer. 1999).

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyesters that accumulate as inclusions in a wide variety of bacteria. These bacterial polymers have properties ranging from stiff and brittle plastics to rubber-like materials. Because of their inherent biodegradability. PHAs are regarded as an attractive source of nonpolluting plastics and elastomers that can be used for specialty and commodity products.

The irx3 mutation has been mapped to the top arm of chromosome V near the marker nga106. Expressed sequence tag clone 75G11. which exhibits sequence similarity to cellulose synthase. was found to be tightly linked to irx3. and genomic clones containing the gene corresponding to clone 75G11 complemented the irx3 mutation. Thus. the IRX3 gene encodes a cellulose synthase component that is specifically required for the synthesis of cellulose in the secondary cell wall. The irx3 mutant allele contains a stop codon that truncates the gene product by 168 amino acids. suggesting that this allele is null.

During development. stomata are specified and positioned nonrandomly by the integration of asymmetric cell divisions and intercellular signaling. The Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase gene. YODA. acts as part of a molecular switch controlling cell identities in the epidermis. Null mutations in YODA lead to excess stomata. whereas constitutive activation of YODA eliminated stomata.

Mutants from four phenotypic classes have been characterized in detail. and genetic tests show that these result from single nuclear recessive mutations in four different genes designated RHD1. RHD2. RHD3. and RHD4. The phenotypic analysis of the mutants and homozygous double mutants has led to a proposed model for root hair development and the stages at which the genes are normally required. The RHD1 gene product appears to be necessary for proper initiation of root hairs. whereas the RHD2. RHD3. and RHD4 gene products are required for normal hair elongation.

This fundamental asymmetry sets the stage for further embryonic development. but the events mediating it are poorly understood. We have identified a MAPKK kinase gene. named YODA. that promotes extra-embryonic cell fates in the basal lineage. In loss-of-function mutants. the zygote does not elongate properly. and the cells of the basal lineage are eventually incorporated into the embryo instead of differentiating the extra-embryonic suspensor. Gain-of-function alleles cause exaggerated growth of the suspensor and can suppress embryonic development to a degree where no recognizable proembryo is formed.

Although studies of plant anatomy. morphology. and physiology have contributed much to our understanding of plant morphogenesis. virtually nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. In contrast to the important role of genetics in our understanding of the regulation of development in a number of animal and microbial systems. the genetic analysis of such processes in plants has not been a widely employed approach [Marx. 19831.

One facet of such host specialization is likely to be penetration of the host cell wall. a major barrier to infection. A mutation in the pmr5 gene rendered Arabidopsis resistant to the powdery mildew species Erysiphe cichoracearum and Erysiphe orontii. but not to the unrelated pathogens Pseudomonas syringae or Peronospora parasitica. PMR5 belongs to a large family of plant‐specific genes of unknown function. pmr5‐mediated resistance did not require signaling through either the salicylic acid or jasmonic acid/ethylene defense pathways. suggesting resistance in this mutant may be due either to the loss of a susceptibility factor or to the activation of a novel form of defense.

We found that genes associated with the same metabolic pathway are. on average. more highly coexpressed than genes from different pathways.

Nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants of strain BD413 were isolated that failed to accumulate wax esters under nitrogen-limited growth conditions. One of the mutants. Wow15 (without wax). accumulated wax when grown in the presence of cis-11-hexadecenal and hexadecanol but not hexadecane or hexadecanoic acid. This suggested that the mutation may have inactivated a gene encoding either an acyl-acyl carrier protein or acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase.

Embryos from both types of mutants were radially swollen with greatly reduced levels of crystalline cellulose. the principal structural component of the cell wall. Because RSW1 was previously shown to encode a catalytic subunit of cellulose synthase. the similar morphology of knf and rsw1-2 embryos suggests that the radially swollen phenotype of knf mutants is largely due to their cellulose deficiency. Map-based cloning of the KNF gene and enzyme assays of knf embryos demonstrated that KNF encodes α-glucosidase I. the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in N-linked glycan processing.

The mutation appears to affect carboxylase activation specifically. and not any other enzyme of the photosynthesis or photorespiratory cycles. The effect of the mutation on carboxylase activation is indirect. inasmuch as the properties of ribulose-1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase purified from the mutant are not distinguishable from those of the wild type enzyme. The mutant requires high levels of atmospheric CO2 for growth because photosynthesis is severely impaired in atmospheres containing normal levels of CO2. irrespective of the atmospheric O2 concentration.

The genes encoded mutant alleles of PROCUSTE1 and KORRIGAN. which both encode proteins that have previously been implicated in cellulose synthesis. Analysis of microtubules in the mutants revealed that both mutants have altered orientation of root cortical microtubules. Similarly. isoxaben. an inhibitor of cellulose synthesis. also altered the orientation of cortical microtubules while exogenous cellulose degradation did not. Thus. our results substantiate that proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis influence cytoskeletal organization and indicate that this influence on cortical microtubule stability and orientation is correlated with cellulose …,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC,164,http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/147/4/1723.short,16633183627113325205,/scholar?cites=16633183627113325205,,http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/plantphysiol/147/4/1723.full.pdf,0

Molecular analysis of the cytoplasmic genomes of variegated plants from two independent chm mutant lines. using specific chloroplast and mitochondrial probes. showed that the chm mutations reproducibly induce the appearance of specific new restriction fragments in the mitochondrial genome. The presence of these restriction fragments cosegregated with the variegated phenotype in the progeny of crosses between mutant and wild-type plants. Sequence analysis of one of the new restriction fragments found in the variegated plants suggested that it was the product of a rearrangement event involving regions of the mitochondrial genome.

Time-course experiments revealed that FucAl-containing RG-I first localizes in cell walls as uniformly distributed punctae that likely mark the sites of vesicle-mediated delivery of new polysaccharides to growing cell walls.

The altered lipid composition of the mutant had pronounced effects on chloroplast ultrastructure. thylakoid membrane protein and chlorophyll content. electron transport rates. and the thermal stability of the photosynthetic membranes. The change in chloroplast ultrastructure was due to a 48% decrease in the amount of appressed membranes that was not compensated for by an increased amount of nonappressed membrane. This resulted in a net loss of 36% of the thylakoid membrane per chloroplast and a corresponding reduction in chlorophyll and protein content.

Our  in vivo observations show that. as in cytokinesis. cellularisation of the  Arabidopsis endosperm is coupled to nuclear division.

The kinetics of in vivo labeling of lipids with [14C]acetate and quantitative analysis of the fatty acid compositions of individual lipids suggests that reduced activity of a glycerolipid n-3 desaturase is responsible for the altered lipid composition of the mutant. The effects of the mutation are most pronounced when plants are grown at temperatures above 26°C but are relatively minor below 18°C. suggesting a temperature-sensitive enzyme. Since the desaturation of both 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids is altered. it appears that the affected enzyme lacks specificity with respect to acyl group chain length and that it is located in the chloroplast where 16:3-monogalactosyldiglyceride is synthesized.

However. the central question of how these sugars are perceived in the context of the complex cell wall matrix remains largely elusive. To address this question in a systematic fashion we performed an extensive comparative systems analysis of how the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa responds to the three main cell wall polysaccharides: pectin. hemicellulose and cellulose. We found the pectic response to be largely independent of the cellulolytic one with some overlap to hemicellulose. and in its extent surprisingly high. suggesting advantages for the fungus beyond being a mere carbon source. Our approach furthermore allowed us to identify carbon source‐specific adaptations. such as the induction of the unfolded protein response on cellulose. and a commonly induced set of 29 …,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC,87,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mmi.12459,14442605796461197003,/scholar?cites=14442605796461197003,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/mmi.12459,0

Analysis of the fatty acid compositions of individual lipids and the kinetics of lipid labeling with [14C]acetate in vivo indicate that the mutant lacks activity of the chloroplast glycerolipid ω-6 desaturase. As a result. lipids synthesized by the prokaryotic pathway are not desaturated further than 18:1 and 16:1. Lipids derived from the eukaryotic pathway are desaturated—presumably by the endoplasmic reticulum 18:1 phosphatidylcholine desaturase.

Quantitative analysis of the fatty acid composition of individual lipids suggested that the mutant is deficient in the activity of a chloroplast ω9 fatty acid desaturase which normally introduces a double bond in 16-carbon acyl chains esterified to monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGD). The mutant exhibited an increased ratio of 18- to 16-carbon fatty acids in MGD due to a change in the relative contribution of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways of lipid biosynthesis.

In spite of the importance of this defense response. relatively little is known about the plant components that execute the cell death program or about its regulation in response to pathogen attack. We isolated the edr2-6 mutant. an allele of the previously described edr2 mutants. We found that edr2-6 exhibited an exaggerated chlorosis and necrosis response to attack by three pathogens. two powdery mildew and one downy mildew species. but not in response to abiotic stresses or attack by the bacterial leaf speck pathogen. The chlorosis and necrosis did not spread beyond inoculated sites suggesting that EDR2 limits the initiation of cell death rather than its spread. The pathogen-induced chlorosis and necrosis of edr2-6 was correlated with a stimulation of the salicylic acid defense pathway and was suppressed in mutants deficient in salicylic acid signaling. EDR2 encodes a novel protein with a pleckstrin homology and a StAR transfer (START) domain as well as a plant-specific domain of unknown function. DUF1336.

Lysine 191. the residue involved in carbamate formation. was replaced with a glutamate in order to mimic the anionic nature of the carbamate. The resulting enzyme was capable of binding the six-carbon transition state analog carboxyarabinitol bisphosphate. but completely lacked catalytic activity. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme. carboxyarabinitol bisphosphate binding was not stabilized by divalent metal and CO2.

These mutants accumulate elevated levels of pppGpp during amino acid starvation or carbon source downshift. and exhibit a reduced rate of pppGpp degradation in vivo.

A gpp spoT double mutant. constructed by employing a leaky spoT mutation. was found to have a slower rate of pppGpp degradation than the gpp mutant alone.

The chilling-sensitive nature of the mutant line is due to a single recessive nuclear mutation at a locus designated chs1. In contrast to wild-type plants. which are not adversely affected by low temperatures. the chs1 mutant is killed by several days of exposure to temperatures below 18°C. Following exposure to chilling temperatures. the mutant displays two common symptoms of chilling injury—leaf chlorosis and electrolyte leakage.

These terms were defined years ago with respect to the nearest apex (Figure 1a). This is an anatomical distinction and. because root and shoot apices point in opposite directions. apical and basal refer to opposite directions in the two parts of the plant [1]. One exception is the early embryo where no distinct root apex is identified and for which the presumptive root pole serves as the base. This embryological use of apical and basal co-existed with the anatomical use for years. presumably because until a root as such forms. there is no explicit conflict in the meaning of the terms.However. we now know that a primary axis running from shoot to root is established in the early embryo and is maintained throughout development. This axis is exemplified by the localization of the PIN1 protein. which is targeted to the cell edge facing the root tip regardless of a cell’s position relative to the root–shoot junction. Jiri Friml et al.[2] rightly pointed out that it is confusing to refer to this uniform polarity differently in shoot and root. They argue that cell polarity should trump anatomy in the definitions of apical and basal. at least when polarity at the level of the cell is being discussed (Figure 1b). Although both anatomical and cellular definitions of apical and basal are rational. their current co-existence is problematic.

This has created new opportunities to genetically engineer higher plants to produce edible fats and oils with predefined fatty acid composition. Because of the chemical diversity of plants. the genes required for synthesis of many different types of lipids exist in nondomesticated species. Thus. it should be possible to modify the storage-lipid composition of crop plants by transferring the relevant genes from the wild species into crop plants.

We identified a suppressor named mongoose1 (mon1) that suppressed the growth defects of cobra. partially restored cellulose levels. and restored the esterification ratio of pectin to wild-type levels. mon1 was mapped to the MEDIATOR16 (MED16) locus. a tail mediator subunit. also known as SENSITIVE TO FREEZING6 (SFR6). When separated from the cobra mutation. mutations in MED16 caused resistance to cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors. consistent with their ability to suppress the cobra cellulose deficiency. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a number of cell wall genes are misregulated in med16 mutants.

50587,The transcription factor PDR-1 is a multi-functional regulator and key component of pectin deconstruction and catabolism in Neurospora crassa,2017,Nils Thieme and Vincent W Wu and Axel Dietschmann and Asaf A Salamov and Mei Wang and Jenifer Johnson and Vasanth R Singan and Igor V Grigoriev and N Louise Glass and Chris R Somerville and J Philipp Benz,10,Biotechnology for biofuels,1,1-21,BioMed Central,Pectin is an abundant component in many fruit and vegetable wastes and could therefore be an excellent resource for biorefinery. but is currently underutilized. Fungal pectinases already play a crucial role for industrial purposes. such as for foodstuff processing. However. the regulation of pectinase gene expression is still poorly understood. For an optimal utilization of plant biomass for biorefinery and biofuel production. a detailed analysis of the underlying regulatory mechanisms is warranted. In this study. we applied the genetic resources of the filamentous ascomycete species Neurospora crassa to screen for transcription factors that play a major role in pectinase induction. The pectin degradation regulator-1 (PDR-1) was identified through a transcription factor mutant screen in N. crassa. The Δpdr-1 mutant exhibited a severe growth defect on pectin and all tested pectin-related poly- and monosaccharides. Biochemical as well as transcriptional analyses of WT and the Δpdr-1 mutant revealed that while PDR-1-mediated gene induction was dependent on the presence of l-rhamnose. it also strongly affected the degradation of the homogalacturonan backbone. The expression of the endo-polygalacturonase gh28-1 was greatly reduced in the Δpdr-1 mutant. while the expression levels of all pectate lyase genes increased. Moreover. a pdr-1 overexpression strain displayed substantially increased pectinase production. Promoter analysis of the PDR-1 regulon allowed refinement of the putative PDR-1 DNA-binding motif. PDR-1 is highly conserved in filamentous ascomycete fungi and is present in many pathogenic and industrially important fungi.

In order to isolate genes that are involved in de novo cell wall formation. we performed a large-scale. microscope-based screen for Arabidopsis mutants that severely impair cytokinesis in the embryo. We recovered 35 mutations that form abnormally enlarged cells with multiple. often polyploid nuclei and incomplete cell walls. These mutants represent seven genes. four of which have previously been implicated in phragmoplast or cell plate function. Mutations in two loci show strongly reduced transmission through the haploid gametophytic generation. Molecular cloning of both corresponding genes reveals that one is represented by hypomorphic alleles of the kinesin-5 gene RADIALLY SWOLLEN 7 (homologous to tobacco kinesin-related protein TKRP125). and that the other gene corresponds to the Arabidopsis FUSED ortholog TWO-IN-ONE (originally identified based on its function in pollen development).

Although higher plants are develop-mentally more complex than the microorganisms used in their studies. the general approach remains widely applicable. In this review we have reiter-ated these principles and have outlined what we consider to be the major technical and conceptual considerations associated with the use Of mutants for metabolic studies in plants. In addition. we have provided a collection of examples from diverse aspects of plant biochemistry where mutants have proven useful or essential in metabolic studies. In doing so we have tried to address the two major questions that arise in most studies involving the use of mutants:(I) How does one ﬁnd speciﬁc mutants?(2) Of what use are they in the context of physiology and biochemistry? In addressing the latter question we were frequently reminded of the fact that mutant analysis is a rela-tively underexploited approach to the study of plant biochemistry.

50613,The physical map of an Arabidopsis chromosome,1996,Chris Somerville,1,,1,2,Elsevier,One of the principal reasons for the phenomenal growth of interest in Arabidopsis during the past decade has been the inherent promise of technical advantages associated with the unusually small genome. These advantages were most clearly enunciated in a review by Meyerowitz 1 in which the possibility of implementing map-based cloning in Arabidopsis was outlined. AI-though none of the technical resources to undertake map-based cloning was available at that time. the argument that it was feasible was compelling and inspiring. The importance of map-based cloning is that any mutation that can be mapped can be cloned: once cloned. the full spectrum of techniques associated with cell and molecular biology can be brought to bear on elucidating the function of the corresponding gene. Even the promise that this technology would be applicable to Arabidopsis stimulated many biologists because it meant that …,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C,8,https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/pdf/S1360-1385(96)80014-8.pdf,6936774435291052627,/scholar?cites=6936774435291052627,,,0
50614,Genetic manipulation of the fatty acid composition of plant lipids,1988,Chris R Somerville,,,,19-44,Springer. Boston. MA,There are. in principle. many attractive opportunities for using recombinant DNA techniques to manipulate the lipid metabolism of higher plants. For instance. there are currently no major field crops that are used as a source of medium chain fatty acids (C8 – C12). If we understood the factors that regulate the acyl group chain length of storage lipids. it might be possible to genetically engineer one or more crop species to produce medium or very long chain fatty acids. Similarly. if detailed information were available concerning the enzymes which regulate fatty acid desaturation. it might be possible to use cloned genes for these enzymes to manipulate the fatty acid composition of many species to suit specific industrial needs. There are also many conceivable applications of recombinant DNA techniques to the manipulation of membrane lipid composition for both applied and academic ends.

Arabidopsis is a typical 16:3-plant in which both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways [4] contribute to the production of chloroplast lipids. We have investigated the pattern of lipid metabolism in wild type Arabidopsis and calculated the fluxes of carbon involved [5]. An abbreviated version of this analysis is shown in Fig. la. For every 1000 fatty acid molecules synthesized in the chloroplast 390 enter the prokaryotic pathway in the chloroplast envelope while 610 are exported as CoA esters to enter the eukaryotic pathway. Of these 340 are reimported into the chloroplast. Overall. almost equal amounts of chloroplast lipids are produced by each pathway.

Live-cell imaging of fluorescently labeled cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) revealed slowing of CSCs in shv3svl1 compared to WT that is enhanced in a sucrose-conditional manner.

Depending on economic conditions. several billion people who formerly depended on public or nonmotorized transportation will soon be able to purchase private vehicles.

50644,Development of a system for efficient chromosome walking in Arabidopsis.,1991,ERWIN Grill and CHRIS Somerville,45,Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology,,57-62,,The small genome size of Arabidopsis and the low level of repetitive DNA sequences make this crucifer an attractive system for chromosome walking to isolate genes. Mapping of a mutant locus relative to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers provides the first step towards isolating the corresponding gene. The RFLP marker closest to the target gene serves as a starting point. The distance between gene and marker is generally in the range of 50-200 kb. In order to facilitate chromosome walking of this magnitude. we constructed a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) library of Arabidopsis. Large fragments of Arabidopsis DNA were cloned into a YAC vector and transformed into yeast. The library contains more than 10 equivalents of the Arabidopsis genome. YACs containing sequences of RFLP markers of Arabidopsis revealed an average insert size of 150 kb. Thus. 1-3 (contiguous) YACs should be sufficient to clone genes from Arabidopsis by chromosome walking. In order to use the system to isolate genes involved in the signal transduction of abscisic acid. we fine-mapped the mutant loci abi-1 and abi-2. which confer abscisic acid insensitivity. relative to RFLPs and isolated the corresponding YACs.,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C,2,https://europepmc.org/article/med/1688209,15198310561430176764,/scholar?cites=15198310561430176764,,,0

50646,Ways of improving photosynthesis by induced mutation,1984,WL Ogren and CR Somerville and RJ Spreitzer and MH Spalding,,,,,,[en] Three ways of increasing photosynthetic efficiency in C 3 plants by induced mutation are described. In the first procedure. using the crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism. several single recessive nuclear mutations have been recovered in enzymes of the photorespiratory pathway. These mutations render photorespiration a conditionally lethal characteristic. The mutant strains are then used to select for second-site revertants which survive the lethal conditions. Such revertants would be unable to initiate the photorespiratory pathway. and therefore possess enhanced photosynthetic activity. In a second approach. designed to determine the feasibility of altering the two activities of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco). the enzyme which regulates carbon flow between photosynthesis and photorespiration. uniparental mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardii have been recovered which possess defective Rubisco. These mutants. lacking the ability to fix CO 2. cannot survive phototrophically. Phototrophic revertants are then recovered and the Rubisco enzyme is examined. A search is being made for revertants with an increased carboxylation/oxygenation ratio. indicating increased photosynthetic efficiency. Finally. unicellular algae such as C. reinhardii are able to increase the in-vivo carboxylation efficiency of Rubisco by concentrating CO 2 internally. To elucidate the nature of this CO 2 concentrating system. and to determine whether such a system might be incorporated into higher plant species with C 3 photosynthesis. induced mutants which are not capable of concentrating CO 2 have been sought.

Representative COBRA genes from the different clades were expressed in a cobra mutant background. Surprisingly. none of the COBRA-LIKE genes was able to complement cobra. including the closest homolog which we found to bind cellulose with the same avidity as COBRA.

Singlet oxygen (102) and oxygen radicals such as superoxide anion (O2 -) are responsible for photooxidative damage to pigments. lipids. and proteins. Singlet oxygen is produced when oxygen quenches triplet chlorophyll. Protection from 1O2 is offered by the carotenoids which quench both 1O2 and triplet chlorophyll (1). Superoxide anions are produced at the reducing side of photosystem I. either by reaction with P430. an insoluble electron acceptor. (2) or with ferredoxin (3).

50669,Molecular Biology of Photosynthesis,2012,Hans J Bohnert and W Bottomley and DA Bryant and John E Mullet and WL Ogren and Himadri Pakrasi and CR Somerville,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Molecular biology. particularly molecular genetics. is among the newest and most powerful approach in modern photosynthesis research. Development of molecular biology techniques has provided new methods to solve old problems in many biological disciplines. Molecular biology has its greatest potential for contribution when applied in combination with other disciplines. to focus not just on genes and molecules. but on the complex interaction between them and the biochemical pathways in the whole organism. Photosynthesis is surely the best studied research area in plant biology. making this field the foremost candidate for successfully employing molecular genetic techniques. Already. the success of molecular biology in photosynthesis has been nothing short of spectacular. Work performed over the last few years. much of which is sum marized in this volume. stands in evidence. Techniques such as site-specific mutagenesis have helped us in examining the roles of individual protein domains in the function of multiunit complexes such as the enzyme ribulose-l. 5-bisphos phate carboxylase/oxygenase (RUBISCO) and the oxygen evolving photo system (the photosystem II). The techniques of molecular biology have been very important in advancing the state of knowledge of the reaction center from the photosynthetic bacteria whose structure has been elegantly deduced by H.

50676,The Development of Cellulosic Fuels,2010,Chris Somerville,98,Biophysical Journal,3,210a,Elsevier,Because plants can be deployed inexpensively on a large scale to capture and store solar energy in biomass. one way of moving toward the development of carbon neutral fuels is to use plant biomass for production of fuels. The efficient production of biofuels by routes other than gasification will require innovation in three main areas: sustainable production of feedstocks that do not compete with food production. depolymerization of feedstocks. and conversion of feedstocks to fuels. At present. it is expected that gasoline and diesel replacements will ultimately be derived from cellulosic biomass. In this respect there is renewed interest in identifying plants that have optimal biomass accumulation and understanding the production issues associated with large-scale cultivation and sustainable harvesting of such species.

50686,Genetic Analysis of Cell Walls,2006,Chris Somerville,,"The Science and Lore of the Plant Cell Wall: Biosynthesis, Structure and Function",,222,Universal-Publishers,My interest in plant cell walls began during a conversation with Peter Albersheim in 1985. We were invited to a small workshop on Fraser Island Australia that was organized by Jim Peacock to encourage dialog between US and Australian Scientists. The meeting was held in a very isolated but beautiful setting on the ocean that was conducive to long open-ended conversations. As Peter described the many challenges associated with understanding how cell walls were made and how they functioned. I became intrigued by the idea that the field would greatly benefit by a genetic approach. I had recently had some success in identifying a series of mutants that was useful in resolving certain difficult problems in photorespiration (Somerville 2001) and. in collaboration with John Browse and Peter McCourt. had also had some successes in isolating a large series of mutants that would ultimately prove useful in working out various aspects of lipid metabolism (Browse et al. 1985; Somerville and Browse 1991). I was. and am. of the opinion that mutations could be identified in essentially any process by screening directly for variation in heavily mutagenized populations. In the case of lipid metabolism. we had isolated mutants by simply screening large numbers of plants for alterations in fatty acid composition by gas chromatography. I assumed that the same method could work for finding variation in cell wall composition.For the next five years I tried repeatedly without success to interest any of my students or postdocs in working on cell wall mutants.

Mutations in a new locus required for microspore separation. QRT3. were isolated. and the corresponding gene was cloned by T-DNA tagging. QRT3 encodes a protein that is approximately 30% similar to an endopolygalacturonase from peach (Prunus persica). The QRT3 protein was expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and found to exhibit polygalacturonase activity. In situ hybridization experiments showed that QRT3 is specifically and transiently expressed in the tapetum during the phase when microspores separate from their meiotic siblings. Immunohistochemical localization of QRT3 indicated that the protein is secreted from tapetal cells during the early microspore stage. Thus.

50696,The Arabidopsis SKU5 Gene Encodes an Extracellular Glycosyl Glycoprotein Involved in Directional Root GrowtPhosphatidylinositol–Anchored,2002,John Sedbrook and Kathleen Carroll and Kai Hung and Patrick Masson and Chris Somerville,,,,,,To investigate how roots respond to directional cues. we characterized a T-DNA–tagged Arabidopsis mutant named sku5 in which the roots skewed and looped away from the normal downward direction of growth on inclined agar surfaces. sku5 roots and etiolated hypocotyls were slightly shorter than normal and exhibited a counterclockwise (lefthanded) axial rotation bias. The surface-dependent skewing phenotype disappeared when the roots penetrated the agar surface. but the axial rotation defect persisted. revealing that these two directional growth processes are separable. The SKU5 gene belongs to a 19-member gene family designated SKS (SKU5 Similar) that is related structurally to the multiple-copper oxidases ascorbate oxidase and laccase. However. the SKS proteins lack several of the conserved copper binding motifs characteristic of copper oxidases. and no enzymatic function could be assigned to the SKU5 protein. Analysis of plants expressing SKU5 reporter constructs and protein gel blot analysis showed that SKU5 was expressed most strongly in expanding tissues. SKU5 was glycosylated and modified by glycosyl phosphatidylinositol and localized to both the plasma membrane and the cell wall. Our observations suggest that SKU5 affects two directional growth processes. possibly by participating in cell wall expansion,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:c0d25C_dN_AC,0,https://thekeep.eiu.edu/bio_fac/292/,,,,,0

50714,The Role of Membrane Lipid Composition,1993,Chris Somerville,,Year Book,,,Carnegie Institution of Washington,by Chris Somerville long-standing interest in my laboratory is the role of membrane lipid composition in the ability of higher plants to withstand temperature stress. Many higher plants are subjected to wide seasonal variation in temperature and may experience temperature-induced injury at both extremes. For instance. many plants of tropical origin are injured by exposure to low. non-freezing temperatures that do not harm plants from temperate zones (Fig. 1). The existence of regulated adaptive mechanisms that can protect plants against the harmful effects of temperature extremes is evident in the ability of some plants to acclimate to survive exposure to freezing if first given a period of gradual exposure to low temperature. Similarly. if given a period of growth in progressively warmer conditions. many species acclimate to thermal extremes that would injure non-acclimated plants. A large body of correlative evidence has accumulated from comparative physiological studies that implicates membrane lipid composition as a component of such temperaturetolerance mechanisms. Much of the focus has been on the degree to which the fatty acyl chains of the lipids are saturated. In a saturated fatty acid. each of the carbon molecules within the acyl chain are bonded to two hydrogen molecules. This allows the lipids to be packed very tightly together. resulting in a membrane with relatively solid composition. Butter is a familiar example of a substance containing a high proportion of saturated fatty acids.

By visually screening roots from 12.000 mutagenized Arabidopsis seedlings on Petri dishes. more than 40 root hair mutants have been identified. We have focused our attention on mutants that possess nuclear recessive mutations in three genes (RHD2. RHD3. and RDH4) that appear to be involved in controlling polar cell growth in root hairs.

In a green leaf. about 50% of the organic sulfur is bound in SQD. Therefore. this sulfolipid constitutes a major component of the global sulfur cycle. However. since the discovery of SQD. very little progress has been made towards the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway. For a genetical analysis of the pathway of SQD. we selected the photosynthetic purple-nonsulfur bacterium R. sphaeroides. as our model system. We have been able to isolate several classes of mutants. which show reduced levels of SQD. Some of the mutants accumulate {sup 35} S-labeled. water soluble compounds. We expect that these compounds are related to precursors or are precursors. which accumulate due to a specific block in the biosynthetic pathway of SQD. To study the possible precursor function of these compounds. we developed an in vitro SQD biosynthesis system using cell free extracts from R. sphaeroides. In addition. we have been able to isolate cosmids prepared from WT DNA. which complement three classes of SQD mutants in R. sphaeroides. The analysis and expression of the genes encoded by these cosmids should facilitate the characterization of the proteins involved in SQD biosynthesis.,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC,0,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5840919,,,,,0

50721,Altered regulation of f8-amylase activity in mutants of Arabidopsis with lesions in starch metabolism,1989,JACK PREISS and CHRIS SOMERVILLE,86,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,,5830-5833,,Three classes of mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynhold with alterations in starch metabolism were found to have higher levels of leaf amylase activity than the wild type when grown in a 12-hr photoperiod. This effect was dependent upon the developmental stage of the plants and was largely suppressed during growth in continuous light. The various amylolytic activities in crude extracts were separated by electrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by activity staining. The increased amylase activity in the mutants wgs due to an up to 40-fold increase in the activity of an extrachloroplast j8-amylase (EC 3.2. 1.2). These observations indicate the existence of a regulatory mechanism that controls the amount of (3-amylase activity in response to fluctuations in photosynthetic carbohydrate metabolism. It is paradoxical that fi-amylase appears to be a highly regulated enzyme. but as yet no physiologically relevant function can be assigned to this enzyme due to the absence of starch in the cytoplasmic compartment of leaf cells.One of the few experimental treatments of higher plants that may result in an increase in the rate of photosynthetic CO2 fixation is to remove some of the leaves from plants at the stage during which seeds are developing (1. 2). In many species. this causes an increase in the rate ofphotosynthetic CO2 fixation in the remaining leaves. The mechanisms that regulate the altered rate of photosynthesis are not known. but they have been suggested to be either a hormonal signal produced by the developing seeds or a metabolic effect of the altered carbohydrate pools that occur in the leaf cells because of an …,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:IEpB_1CIIT4C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2965283517244544098&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0
50722,Mutants of arabidopsis thaliana that exhibit chlorosis in an atmosphere enriched with CO sub 2,1989,NN Artus and C Somerville,89,"Plant Physiology, Supplement;(USA)",4,,,Two nonallelic. nuclear recessive mutations have been isolated which cause chlorosis of plants grown in an atmosphere enriched to 2% CO {sub 2}. For one of the mutant lines. chlorosis begins at the veins and gradually spreads to the interveinal regions. A minimum light intensity of ca. 50 {mu} E m {sup {minus} 2} s {sup {minus} 1} was required for this response. For the other mutant line. the yellowing is independent of the light intensity and begins at the basal regions of the leaves and spreads to the tips. Neither line became chlorotic in a low O {sub 2} atmosphere which suppressed photorespiration as effectively as 2% CO {sub 2}. Thus. the mutations do not impose a requirement for photorespiration. Root elongation and callus growth were not affected by high CO {sub 2} for either mutant line. The possibilities that the high CO {sub 2}-sensitive phenotypes are caused by an effect of CO {sub 2} on stomata or ethylene synthesis have also been ruled out.,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:iINcni2fUZgC,0,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7024822,,,,,0

The {beta}-amylases from phosoglucomutase deficient (starchless) and WT leaves were purified to homogeneity in two steps utilizing polyethylene glycol fractionation. and cyclohexaamylose affinity chromatography. The enzyme from both mutant and WT leaves had negligible activity toward either {beta}-limit dextrin or pullulan.

Three ways of increasing photosynthetic efficiency in C3 plants by induced mutation are described. In the first procedure. using the crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism. several single recessive nuclear mutations have been recovered in enzymes of the photorespiratory pathway. These mutations render photorespiration a conditionally lethal characteristic. The mutant strains are then used to select for second-site revertants which survive the lethal conditions. Such revertants would be unable to initiate the photorespiratory pathway. and therefore possess enhanced photosynthetic activity. In a second approach. designed to determine the feasibility of altering the two activities of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco). the enzyme which regulates carbon flow between photosynthesis and photorespiration. uniparental mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardii have been recovered which possess defective Rubisco. These mutants. lacking the ability to fix CO2. cannot survive phototrophically. Phototrophic revertants are then recovered and the Rubisco enzyme is examined. A search is being made for revertants with an increased carboxylation/oxygenation ratio. indicating increased photosynthetic efficiency. Finally. unicellular algae such as C. reinhardii are able to increase the in-vivo carboxylation efficiency of Rubisco by concentrating CO2 internally. To elucidate the nature of this CO2 concentrating system. and to determine whether such a system might be in corporated into higher plant species with C3 photosynthesis. induced mutants which are not capable of …,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:ByB5RH_0zRoC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15534251491472856944&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0
50732,The Use of Mutants for the Study of Plant Metabolism,1980,CR SOMERVILLE,13,The Biochemistry of Plants: Methodology,,33,Academic Press,The basic concepts associated with the isolation of mutations affecting metabolic pathways and their use for studies of metabolism were clearly enunciated by Beadle and Tatum (1941). Although higher plants are develop-mentally more complex than the microorganisms used in their studies. the general approach remains widely applicable. In this review we have reiter-ated these principles and have outlined what we consider to be the major technical and conceptual considerations associated with the use of mutants for metabolic studies in plants. In addition. we have provided a collection of examples from diverse aspects of plant biochemistry where mutants have proven useful or essential in metabolic studies. In doing so we have tried to address the two major questions that arise in most studies involving the use of mutants:(1) How does one find specific mutants?(2) Of what use are they in the context of physiology and biochemistry? In addressing the latter ques-tion we were frequently reminded of the fact that mutant analysis is a rela-tively underexploited approach to the study of plant biochemistry.

50737,Genetic Evidence That Cellulose Synthase Activity Influences Microtubule Cortical Array Organization1 [W][OA],,Alexander R Paredez and Staffan Persson and David W Ehrhardt and Chris R Somerville,,,,,,To identify factors that influence cytoskeletal organization we screened for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants that show hypersensitivity to the microtubule destabilizing drug oryzalin. We cloned the genes corresponding to two of the 131 mutant lines obtained. The genes encoded mutant alleles of PROCUSTE1 and KORRIGAN. which both encode proteins that have previously been implicated in cellulose synthesis. Analysis of microtubules in the mutants revealed that both mutants have altered orientation of root cortical microtubules. Similarly. isoxaben. an inhibitor of cellulose synthesis. also altered the orientation of cortical microtubules while exogenous cellulose degradation did not. Thus. our results substantiate that proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis influence cytoskeletal organization and indicate that this influence on cortical microtubule stability and orientation is correlated with cellulose synthesis rather than the integrity of the cell wall.Before cortical microtubules were first observed. their existence and function in plant morphogenesis was hypothesized by Green (1962). who treated algal cells with the antispindle drug colchicine and observed a change in the orientation of cellulose microfibril deposition (Green. 1962). Soon after. Ledbetter and Porter (1963) published the first electron microscopy images of plant cell spindle fibers and observed similar fibers at the cell cortex. all with the same hollow structure that they subsequently renamed microtubules. Importantly. these images showed that microtubules were oriented parallel to cellulose microfibrils. and the idea that microtubules might guide cellulose deposition. termed …,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:hQ3-0SoZo6AC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Paredez2/publication/5271662_Genetic_Evidence_That_Cellulose_Synthase_Activity_Influences_Microtubule_Cortical_Array_Organization/links/53f3808b0cf2155be34e28b3/Genetic-Evidence-That-Cellulose-Synthase-Activity-Influences-Microtubule-Cortical-Array-Organization.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Paredez2/publication/5271662_Genetic_Evidence_That_Cellulose_Synthase_Activity_Influences_Microtubule_Cortical_Array_Organization/links/53f3808b0cf2155be34e28b3/Genetic-Evidence-That-Cellulose-Synthase-Activity-Influences-Microtubule-Cortical-Array-Organization.pdf,0
50738,Flow makes vein,,Alex Paredez and Chris Somerville,,,,,,Leaf veins. just like roots and shoots. use flows of the plant hormone auxin to drive their patterning. say Enrico Scarpella (University of Alberta. Canada). Thomas Berleth (University of Toronto. Canada). and colleagues. Models for leaf vein patterning have been based on either auxin flows or reaction–diffusion systems. The flow models had a hard time explaining how loops would arise. But “all the modeling so far has been based on the final pattern.” says Berleth.“Now flow can be reconciled with closed networks. although other types of cellular interactions may also play a role.” His team used the auxin efflux protein AtPIN1 as an early marker of vein formation. Expression was found at a series of “convergence points” at the leaf margin. from where it led down paths that foreshadowed first the leaf’s main central vein and then other major veins connected to the main vein. Auxin is presumed to flow from leaf margin to the interior. consistent with AtPIN1’s polarization to the parts of the cells closest to the main vein. Loops could also form. however. because certain cells had bipolar AtPIN1. allowing auxin flow to the main vein via two alternate routes. Auxin turns on AtPIN1 expression. thus refining and reinforcing the pattern. Interfering with auxin flow disturbs vein formation and spacing. Vein placement seems to depend on the positions of convergence points. but those may be defined both by auxin’s positive feedback on its own flow and on undefined genetic circuits.,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:lD5Rj62EkMEC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7771853.pdf,,,,,0
50739,Real-Time Imaging of Cellulose Reorientation during Cell Wall Expansion in Arabidopsis Roots1 [W][OA],,Charles T Anderson and Andrew Carroll and Laila Akhmetova and Chris Somerville,,,,,,Cellulose forms the major load-bearing network of the plant cell wall. which simultaneously protects the cell and directs its growth. Although the process of cellulose synthesis has been observed. little is known about the behavior of cellulose in the wall after synthesis. Using Pontamine Fast Scarlet 4B. a dye that fluoresces preferentially in the presence of cellulose and has excitation and emission wavelengths suitable for confocal microscopy. we imaged the architecture and dynamics of cellulose in the cell walls of expanding root cells. We found that cellulose exists in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cell walls in large fibrillar bundles that vary in orientation. During anisotropic wall expansion in wild-type plants. we observed that these cellulose bundles rotate in a transverse to longitudinal direction. We also found that cellulose organization is significantly altered in mutants lacking either a cellulose synthase …,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:b1ISl_ktn64C,0,https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25680694.pdf?acceptTC=true&coverpage=false,,,,http://www.personal.psu.edu/cta3/Anderson%202010%20Real-Time%20Imaging%20of%20Cellulose%20Reorientation%20during%20Cell%20Wall%20Expansion%20in%20Arabidopsis%20Roots.pdf,0

Mutants from four phenotypic classes have been characterized in detail. and genetic tests show that these result from single nuclear recessive mutations in four different genes designated RHD1. RHD2. RHD3. and RHD4. The phenotypic analysis of the mutants and homozygous double mutants has led to a proposed model for root hair development and the stages at which the genes are normally required. The RHD1 gene product appears to be necessary for proper initiation of root hairs. whereas the RHD2. RHD3. and RHD4 gene products are required for normal hair elongation. These results demonstrate that root hair development in Arabidopsis is amenable to genetic dissection and should prove to be a useful model system to study the molecular …,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:QvnCfHfiBIkC,0,https://www.jstor.org/stable/3869138?seq=1&cid=pdf-reference,,,,,0

We had previously developed a suite of cloned enzymes that could be used to cleave most of the relevant glycosidic linkages in plant cell walls. The next step. supported by the previous award and this award. was to produce a series of transgenic plants in which synthetic proteins were introduced that contained each of the known sequence motifs that induce prolyl hydroxylation. and subsequent glycosylation. This work was completed and published in Estevez et al (2006). We then engaged on a series of experiments to define the properties of the prolyl hydroxylases that convert certain prolyl resides to hydroxyproline for subsequent glycosylation. This proved to be a challenging goal that required recruitment of an international team of complementary skills and several additional years or research. However. the effort was successful and has been published in Science recenty (Velasquez et al.. 2011).

Cellulose consists of b-1. 4-linked glucan chains assembled into paracrystalline microfibrils that are synthesized by plasma membrane–located cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes. Associations with hemicelluloses are important for microfibril spacing and for maintaining cell wall tensile strength. Several components associated with cellulose synthesis have been identified; however. the biological functions for many of them remain elusive. We show that the chitinase-like (CTL) proteins. CTL1/POM1 and CTL2. are functionally equivalent. affect cellulose biosynthesis. and are likely to play a key role in establishing interactions between cellulose microfibrils and hemicelluloses.

The general issues concern the goals of the joint program office effort. the barriers to success. and strategies for overcoming these barriers. Following preliminary discussions. the panel identified a team of experts from the community to participate with the panel in a two-day workshop (in October 2007) to discuss the status of current research and potential goals for the future. The panel observed that there has been substantial progress over the past five years in developing techniques for building computational models (eg. for metabolic and regulatory networks) of microbes. for analysis of high-throughput datasets. and for the integration and visualization of biological datasets. Given the capability of experimental techniques. the sustained progress in computational capabilities. the status of Genomics: GTL projects and the mission of DOE. the panel concluded that further progress is highly likely and will be important for the goals of Genomics: GTL Program. Progress can most readily be accelerated through a focused. joint effort within the Office of Science.

50746,Regulation of cellulose biosynthesis and deconstruction by protein phosphorylation,,Chris Somerville,,,,,,正 The great abundance of cellulose places it at the forefront as a primary source of biomass for a renewable energy source. and a variety of efforts are underway to improve cellulose deconstruction for the production of cellulosic biofuels. However. the knowledge of how plant cells make cellulose and how microorganisms degrade cellulose remains very rudimentary. Understanding these processes will help optimize the production of cellulosic biofuels. Protein phosphorylation plays critical roles in regulating cellulose biosynthesis and deconstruction. Cellulose microfibrils are synthesized at the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase (CesA) complexes. The CesA 1 and CesA3 components of cellulose synthase complexes are phosphorylated at sites clustered in two hypervariable regions of the proteins. Mutations of the phosphorylated residues to Ala (A) or Glu (E) alter anisotropic cell expansion and bidirectional motility of CesA complexes in the plasma membrane in rapidly expanding hypocotyls. In addition. protein phosphorylation regulates cell wall deconstruction by filamentous fungi. Here we present a mass spectrometry-based quantitative phosphoproteomics approach to identify the regulatory pathways that control the expression and secretion of cell wall degrading enzymes from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.,True,CXXYxf4AAAAJ:MpfHP-DdYjUC,0,https://cpfd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CPFDTOTAL-ZGYL201210001021.htm,,,,,0

50750,1 Energizing Arabidopsis,,Chris Somerville,,,,,,During the past 25 years. plant biologists have developed Arabidopsis into a very powerful tool for basic research. However. total federal funding for plant biology is less than 1% of the NIH budget. This ridiculous situation is not improved by having special interest groups within the plant biology community fighting for crumbs. I have long-believed that the heart of the problem is that plant biology is viewed as agriculture. Legislators view the big problem in agriculture as overproduction and do not see the point of further investments in basic research that might cause more overproduction. Additionally colleagues who work on crops species are likely to be first at the federal trough when the arguments are based on improving agriculture. I suggest that a more relevant social context for basic research in plant biology is energy. Although there is enough fossil fuel to meet our energy needs for three to four hundred years. there is broad consensus that continuing to burn fossil carbon will have unpleasant irreversible environmental consequences. World energy demand is approximately 11 TW. Approximately 100.000 TW arrives at the earth from the sun each year. Unfortunately. the energy density is too low to support large-scale use of photovoltaic cells. By contrast. recent studies by DOE indicate that plant biomass can make a significant contribution. However. the species that are suited for biomass production are undomesticated and have not been adapted for this purpose as yet.

Cathelicidin hCAP18/LL-37 is an innate antimicrobial peptide that is expressed in the skin and acts to eliminate microbial pathogens. Because hCAP18/LL-37 is up-regulated at skin wound sites. we hypothesized that LL-37 induces keratinocyte migration. In this study. we found that 1 μg/ml LL-37 induced the maximum level of keratinocyte migration in the Boyden chamber assay. In addition. LL-37 phosphorylated the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) after 10 min. which suggests that LL-37-induced keratinocyte migration occurs via EGFR transactivation.

They have no tyrosine-kinase or other enzyme motif and their signal-transducing mechanism is unclear. Here we describe two classes of activating mutations in the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR). A single point mutation in the exoplasmic domain enables it to induce hormone-independent cell growth and tumorigenesis after expression in nontumorigenic. interleukin-3-dependent haematopoietic cells. A C-terminal truncation in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPOR renders the receptor hyper-responsive to erythropoietin. but is insufficient to induce hormone-independent growth or tumorigenicity. The activating point mutation retards intracellular transport and turnover of the receptor.

Although typically seen in individuals with sepsis. ALI is also a major complication in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). The pathophysiology of SAP-associated ALI is poorly understood. but elevated serum levels of IL-6 is a reliable marker for disease severity. Here. we used a mouse model of acute pancreatitis–associated (AP-associated) ALI to determine the role of IL-6 in ALI lethality. Il6-deficient mice had a lower death rate compared with wild-type mice with AP. while mice injected with IL-6 were more likely to develop lethal ALI. We found that inflammation-associated NF-κB induced myeloid cell secretion of IL-6. and the effects of secreted IL-6 were mediated by complexation with soluble IL-6 receptor. a process known as trans-signaling.

In this study. we found that the expression levels of Spred-1 and-2 in human HCC tissue were frequently decreased. comparing with those in adjacent non-tumorous tissue. Moreover. Spred expression levels in HCC tissue were inversely correlated with the incidence of tumor invasion and metastasis. Forced expression of Spred-1 inhibited HCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. which was associated with reduced ERK activation.

Although gp130 activation is observed transiently during transverse aortic constriction (TAC). its mechanism of inactivation is largely unknown in cardiomyocytes. We show here that suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). an intrinsic inhibitor of JAK. shows biphasic induction in response to TAC. The induction of SOCS3 was closely correlated with STAT3 phosphorylation. as well as the activation of an embryonic gene program. suggesting that cardiac gp130-JAK signaling is precisely controlled by this endogenous suppressor.

This review focuses on the function of infiltrating immune cells. macrophages. and T cells. in ischemic brain injury. The brain is a sterile organ; however. the activation of Toll‐like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 is pivotal in the beginning of post‐ischemic inflammation. Some endogenous TLR ligands are released from injured brain cells. including high mobility group box 1 and peroxiredoxin family proteins. and activate the infiltrating macrophages and induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines.

However. details of the inflammation process. its resolution after stroke and its effect on pathology and neural damage have not been clarified. Brain swelling. which is often fatal in ischemic stroke patients. occurs at an early stage of stroke due to endothelial cell injury and severe inflammation by infiltrated mononuclear cells including macrophages. neutrophils. and lymphocytes. At early stage of inflammation. macrophages are activated by molecules released from necrotic cells (danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)). and inflammatory cytokines and mediators that increase ischemic brain damage by disruption of the blood-brain barrier are released. After post-ischemic inflammation. macrophages function as scavengers of necrotic cell and brain tissue debris. Such macrophages are also involved in tissue repair and neural cell regeneration by producing tropic factors. The mechanisms of inflammation resolution and conversion of inflammation to neuroprotection are largely unknown.

Since ovarian cancer develops asymptomatically. it is often diagnosed at an advanced and incurable stage. Despite many years of research. there is still a lack of reliable diagnostic markers and methods for early detection and screening.

This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the potential clinical relevance of circulating cell-free miRNA for ovarian cancer diagnosis. prognosis. and therapeutics. Despite the high levels of ribonucleases in many types of body fluids. most of the circulating miRNAs are packaged in microvesicles. exosomes. or apoptotic bodies. are binding to RNA-binding protein such as argonaute 2 or lipoprotein complexes. and are thus highly stable. Cell-free miRNA signatures are known to be parallel to those from the originating tumor cells. indicating that circulating miRNA profiles accurately reflect the tumor profiles.

Cytokines are important not only for maintenance of homeostasis and defense against microbes. but also the onset and progression of disease.

T cell cytokines such as IL-17 and IFN-γ have been shown to play important roles in the progression of brain injury induced by ischemia. We have shown that IL-23 from infiltrated macrophages activates γδT cells. thereby inducing IL-17 from these cells. However. deletion of the IL-23 gene in mice showed a more dramatic protective effect against brain ischemia reperfusion (I/R) model than γδT cell depletion did. suggesting that IL-23 plays some other pivotal role in brain injury in addition to its role in IL-17 induction. To develop therapeutic methods based on these findings. we examined the effect of the JAK kinase inhibitor CP-690550 and an anti-IL12/23 monoclonal antibody on an I/R model. CP-690550 efficiently inhibited IL-17 production from memory T cells in vitro and partly suppressed infarct volume increase after I/R.

In this family. the central SH2 domain and approximately 40 amino acids at the C-terminus (CIS homology domain; CH domain) are well conserved. while the N-terminal region shares little similarity and varies in length. Most CISs appear to be induced by several cytokines and at least three of them (CIS1. CIS3 and JAB) negatively regulate cytokine signal transduction.

50962,The CIS/JAB family: novel negative regulators of JAK signaling pathways,1998,Akihiko Yoshimura,12,,12,1851-1857,Nature Publishing Group,A family of cytokine-inducible SH2 proteins (CISs) has recently been identified and the number of family members is growing. In this family. the central SH2 domain and C-terminal (about 40 amino acids)(CIS homology domain; CH domain) are well conserved. while N-terminal region shares little similarity and varies in length. Most of them appear to be induced after stimulation with several different cytokines and at least three of them (CIS1. CIS3 and JAB) negatively regulate cytokine signal transduction by various means. Forced expression of CIS1 inhibits STAT5 activation by binding to cytokine receptors. whereas CIS3 and JAB directly binds to the kinase domain of JAKs. thereby inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity.

SOCS1 has been shown to inhibit responses to IFN-γ and might thereby play a central role in the outcome of infection. We found that M. tuberculosis is a highly efficient stimulator of SOCS1 expression in murine and human macrophages and in tissues from infected mice. Surprisingly. SOCS1 reduced responses to IL-12. resulting in an impaired IFN-γ secretion by macrophages that in turn accounted for a deteriorated intracellular mycobacterial control. Despite SOCS1 expression. mycobacteria-infected macrophages responded to exogenously added IFN-γ. SOCS1 attenuated the expression of the majority of genes modulated by M. tuberculosis infection of macrophages.

An active efflux pump for cisplatin exists in cisplatin-resistant human epidermoid carcinoma cells (called KB cells). A previous study has suggested that the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent glutathione S-con-jugate export pump (GS-X pump). which exports the bis-(glutathionato)-platinum (II) (GS-platinum) complex. could contribute to cellular resistance to cisplatin. Purpose: In this study. we examined whether the active efflux pump for cisplatin in the cisplatin-resistant KB cells is the GS-X pump and tested its activity by using an endogenous substrate.

Socs3fl/fl lck cre (with SOCS3-deficient myeloid and lymphoid cells. respectively) and gp130F/F mice. with a mutation in gp130 that impedes binding to SOCS3. showed increased susceptibility to infection with M. tuberculosis. SOCS3 binding to gp130 in myeloid cells conveyed resistance to M. tuberculosis infection via the regulation of IL-6/STAT3 signalling. SOCS3 was redundant for mycobacterial control by macrophages in vitro. Instead. SOCS3 expression in infected macrophages and DCs prevented the IL-6-mediated inhibition of TNF and IL-12 secretion and contributed to a timely CD4+ cell-dependent IFN-γ expression in vivo. In T cells.

STAP-2 is also a substrate of breast tumor kinase (Brk). In breast cancers. Brk expression is deregulated and promotes STAT3-dependent cell proliferation. In the present study. manipulated STAP-2 expression demonstrated essential roles of STAP-2 in Brk-mediated STAT3 activation. STAP-2 interacts with both Brk and STAT3. In addition. small interfering RNA-mediated reduction of endogenous STAP-2 expression strongly decreased Brk-mediated STAT3 activation in T47D breast cancer cells.

Treg plasticity has been studied because it may be associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Some studies showed that a minor uncommitted Foxp3+ T cell population. which lacks hypomethylation at Treg-specific demethylation regions (TSDRs). may convert to effector/helper T cells. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1). a negative regulator of cytokine signaling. has been reported to play an important role in Treg cell integrity and function by protecting the cells from excessive inflammatory cytokines.

Sepsis-induced myocardial depression results from the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) evoked by inflammatory cytokines. Methods and Results The effect of CT-1 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiac dysfunction was examined in a rat model of sepsis. In the absence of CT-1.

These physiological effects were accompanied by increased ventricular phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT3. activation of nuclear factor-κB and expression of iNOS mRNA. Notably. administration of CT-1 (20 μg/kg iv) immediately prior to LPS significantly inhibited all of these LPS-induced changes.

The [New Zealand black (NZB) × New Zealand white (NZW)]F1 (BWF1) mouse has been recognized as an important animal model of human SLE. The Th1-prone phenotype of BWF1 mice has been shown to contribute to the development of the lupus. However. the molecular basis for Th1 skewing in BWF1 mice has not been clarified. We noticed that IL-6. IL-12 and other proinflammatory cytokines as well as IκB-ζ induction were higher in mature bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from NZB and BWF1 mice than those from NZW mice. The expression of an IFN-inducible gene Ifi202. a candidate gene for lupus. was almost undetectable in NZW BMDCs.

HMGB1 does not. however. bind to TLRs with high affinity; therefore. the mechanism of HMGB1-mediated TLR activation remains unclear. In this study. we found that fluorescently labeled HMGB1 was efficiently internalized into macrophages through class A scavenger receptors. Although both M1- and M2-type macrophages internalized HMGB1. only M1-type macrophages secreted cytokines in response to HMGB1.

Induction of allograft-specific regulatory T-cells (Tregs) is considered an ideal way to achieve long-term tolerance for allografts. However. efficient in vitro methods for developing allograft-specific Tregs which is applicable to MHC full-mismatched cardiac transplant models have not been established. We compared antigen-nonspecific polyclonal-induced Tregs (iTregs) as well as antigen-specific iTregs and thymus-derived Tregs (nTregs) that were expanded via direct and indirect pathways. We found that iTregs induced via the indirect pathway had the greatest ability to prolong graft survival and suppress angiitis. Antigen-specific iTregs generated ex vivo via both direct and indirect pathways using dendritic cells from F1 mice also induced long-term engraftment without using MHC peptides. In antigen-specific Treg transferred models. activation of dendritic cells and allograft-specific CTL generation were suppressed.

By interpreting experimental results. an existing mathematical model suggested that only phosphorylated STAT1 dimers could translocate to the nucleus and activate gene transcription. In this paper. we examine the role of STAT1 dimerization steps by studying the dynamic behaviors of four alternative models. By analyzing several system properties at low input IFNγ signal including the steady-state antiviral molecule production. to the input. the delay of responses triggered by input. and the parameter sensitivity. we found that the mice JAK/STAT1 system identified by experiments (1) suppresses antiviral molecule production at low input signal.

TGF-β acts as a tumor suppressor in premalignant cells. but it is a tumor promoter for cancerous cells. Such dichotomous actions are dictated by different cellular contexts. Here. we have unveiled a PTEN-Smad3 regulatory loop that provides a new insight in the complex cross talk between TGF-β/Smad and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. We demonstrate that TGF-β triggers apoptosis of wild-type polarized endometrial epithelial cells by a Smad3-dependent activation of PTEN transcription. which results in the inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

Many of these cytokines exert their biological functions through Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) and STAT transcription factors. The CIS (cytokine-inducible SH2 protein) and SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signaling) are a family of intracellular proteins. several of which have emerged as key physiological regulators of cytokine-mediated homeostasis. including innate and adaptive immunity. We investigated the roles of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCSs) in regulating dendritic cell (DC) maturation and function. We showed that SOCS1-deficient DCs induced stronger Th1-type responses both in vitro and in vivo.

The character of the plasma membrane of AMBr-1 was compared with that of V79 by measuring the fusion with the envelope of the Sendai virus and also by measuring membrane fluidity: AMBr-1 was found to be more sensitive to Sendai virus-induced cytolysis than V79. Both assays for membrane-permeability change and electron spin resonance (ESR) study showed an enhanced response to the fusion between viral envelope and plasma membrane in AMBr-1 cells.

Especially. T lymphocytes have been shown to infiltrate into the ischemic brain 24 hours after the onset. however. the function and specific subpopulation of these infiltrated T lymphocytes have not been fully understood. By using cytokine-deficient mice with transient focal ischemia model. we have shown that IL-23 and IL-17 but not IL-6 or IFN-γ play pivotal roles in the ischemic brain injury. We found that IL-23. which was mainly produced from infiltrated macrophages. induced IL-17-producing T lymphocytes in the ischemic brain. IL-23 and IL-17 expression increased 1 day or 3 day after ischemic injury. respectively. and promoted inflammatory responses by increasing the expression of neurotoxic factors. To our surprise. IL-17 was mainly produced by γδT lymphocytes. but not helper T cells. Based on these findings. we have tried to develop new therapeutic strategy for the progression of brain infarction. We found that administration of FTY720 (Fingolimod) and antibody against γδT lymphocytes attenuated ischemic brain damage. Furthermore. antibody against p40 which neutralizes both IL-23 and IL-12 simultaneously was also effective.

In the absence of this molecule. macrophages become extremely prone to an IL-6-dependent expression of arginase-1 (Arg1) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)2. the prototype markers for alternative or classical macrophage activation. respectively. Because both enzymes are antipodean macrophage effector molecules in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. we assessed the relevance of SOCS3 for macrophage activation during experimental tuberculosis using macrophage-specific SOCS3-deficient (LysMcreSOCS3loxP/loxP) mice. Aerosol infection of LysMcreSOCS3loxP/loxP mice resulted in remarkably higher bacterial loads in infected lungs and exacerbated pulmonary inflammation. This increased susceptibility to Mtb infection was accompanied by enhanced levels of both classical and alternative macrophage activation. However. high arginase-1 (Arg1) expression preceded the increased induction of nitric oxide synthase (NOS)2 and at early time points of infection mycobacteria were mostly found in cells positive for Arg1. This sequential activation of Arg1 and NOS2 expression in LysMcreSOCS3loxP/loxP mice appears to favor the initial replication of Mtb particularly in Arg1-positive cells. Neutralization of IL-6 in Mtb-infected LysMcreSOCS3loxP/loxP mice reduced arginase activity and restored control of mycobacterial replication in LysMcreSOCS3loxP/loxP mice.

Mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) or house dust mite (HDM) by intraperitoneal injection of antigen and their airways were then exposed to the same antigen. Levels of antigen-specific immunoglobulins in serum as well as cytokines in bronchoalveolar or peritoneal lavage fluid and lung tissue were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Deficiency of IL-23p19 decreased eosinophils and Th2 cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of OVA-treated mice. while it increased BALF eosinophils of HDM-treated mice. Peritoneal injection of OVA with alum. but not of HDM. induced local synthesis of IL-6. IL-10. and IL-23. Systemic production of antigen-specific IgG1 was partially dependent on IL-23. In contrast. airway exposure to HDM. but not to OVA. induced IL-23p19 mRNA expression in the lungs. In IL-23p19-deficient mice. HDM-exposed lungs did not exhibit the induction of IL-17A. which negatively regulates eosinophilic inflammation.Conclusions: Different antigens induced IL-23 at different part of the body in our similar asthma models. Endogenous IL-23 production at the site of antigen sensitization facilitates type-2 immune responses. whereas IL-23 production and subsequent IL-17A synthesis in the airways suppresses allergic inflammation.,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC,3,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/allergolint/64/Supplement.1/64_5/_article/-char/ja/,4544140956352892366,/scholar?cites=4544140956352892366,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/allergolint/64/Supplement.1/64_5/_pdf,0
51223,CIS: the late-blooming eldest son,2013,Akihiko Yoshimura,14,Nature immunology,7,692-694,Nature Publishing Group,All the biochemical and pathological data reported by Yang et al. 8 support the proposal that CIS is a negative feedback regulator of IL-4 rather than of IL-2. How does CIS inhibit signaling via the receptor for IL-4? One simple mechanism would be that CIS binds the IL-4 receptor; however. this has not been proven. Notably. Yang et al. show that mice with T cell–specific conditional deficiency in CIS have greater TH2 responses than do Cis−/− mice and. paradoxically. the authors do not observe spontaneous airway remodeling in aged mice with T cell–specific conditional deficiency in CIS11. The reason for this remains to be clarified. Clearly. enhanced TH2 and TH9 responses are not the only pathogenic factors in CIS-deficient mice. and defective CIS signaling in other cells. such as cells of the innate immune system and/or airway structural cells. may have a role in airway remodeling and TH9 cell development …,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:4e5Qn2KL_jwC,3,https://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v14/n7/full/ni.2645.html,15588752664093738132,/scholar?cites=15588752664093738132,,,0

Dysregulation of cytokine signaling can cause a variety of diseases. including allergies. autoimmune diseases. inflammation. and cancer. Most cytokines utilize the so-called Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. This pathway is negatively regulated by suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins. SOCS proteins bind to JAK or certain cytokine receptors. thereby suppressing further signaling events. Studies using conditional knockout mice have shown that SOCS proteins are key physiological pathological regulators of inflammation as well as immune homeostasis. Recent studies have also demonstrated that SOCS1 and SOCS3 are important regulators of adaptive immunity. especially helper T cell differentiation.,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:Kqc1aDSOPooC,3,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/inflammregen/31/5/31_5_382/_article/-char/ja/,17943251505988475451,/scholar?cites=17943251505988475451,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/inflammregen/31/5/31_5_382/_pdf,0

We enrolled patients with pSS (n = 6) and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 6) in the discovery cohort using microarray and pSS (n = 14) and HCs (n = 12) in the validation cohort using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Peripheral B cells acquired from these subjects were separated by cell sorting into four subsets: CD38−IgD+ (Bm1). CD38+IgD+ (naive B cells). CD38highIgD+ (pre-germinal centre B cells) and CD38±IgD− (memory B cells). We performed differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).

In an experimental mouse model of crescentic glomerulonephritis induced by an anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody. Tregs started to accumulate in the kidney on day 10 of disease onset and remained at high levels (~ 30–35% of CD4+ T cells) during the late stage (days 21–90). which correlated with stable disease control. Treg depletion on day 21 resulted in the relapse of renal dysfunction and an increase in Th1 cells. suggesting that Tregs are essential for disease control during the convalescence stage.

The adoptive transfer of antigen-specific 3 Tregs has been expected to be a potent therapeutic method for autoimmune diseases. 4 severe allergy. and rejection in organ transplantation. However. effective Treg therapy 5 has not yet been established because of the difficulty in preparing a limited number of 6 antigen-specific Tregs. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have been shown to be 7 a powerful therapeutic method for treating B cell lymphomas. but application of CAR to 8 Treg-mediated therapy has not yet been established. Here. we generated CD19-targeted 9 CAR (CD19-CAR) Tregs from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) 10 and optimized the fraction of the Treg source as 11 CD4+CD25+CD127lowCD45RA+CD45RO-. CD19-CAR Tregs could be expanded in 12 vitro while maintaining Treg properties. including a high expression of the latent form 13 of TGF-β. CD19-CAR Tregs suppressed IgG antibody production from primary B cell 14 differentiation in vitro via a TGF-β-dependent mechanism. Unlike conventional 15 CD19-CAR CD8+T cells. CD19-CAR Tregs suppressed antibody production in 16 immunodeficient mice that were reconstituted with hPBMCs with reducing the risk of 17 graft-versus-host disease. Therefore. the adoptive transfer of CD19-CAR Tregs may 18 provide a novel therapeutic method for treating autoantibody-mediated autoimmune 19 diseases. 20,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:3MwzVuqRcA0C,1,https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/136185/version/1/pdf/render.pdf,15702197485442324342,/scholar?cites=15702197485442324342,,https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/136185/version/1/pdf/render.pdf,0

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are responsible for immune tolerance and are usually activated in secondary lymphatic tissues. Activated Tregs subsequently regulate effector T cell and dendritic cell activation. For clinical applications such as the suppression of both autoimmune diseases and the rejection of transplanted organs. methods to generate stabilized antigen-specific Tregs are required. For this purpose. transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of Foxp3 expression has been investigated. In addition to conventional Tregs. there are some Tregs that reside in tissues and are called tissue Tregs. Tissue Tregs exhibit tissue-specific functions that contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and repair. Such tissue Tregs could also be useful for Treg-based cell therapy. We recently discovered brain Tregs that accumulate in the brain during the chronic phase of ischemic brain injury. Brain Tregs resemble other tissue Tregs. but are unique in expressing neural cell-specific genes such as the serotonin receptor (Htr7); consequently. brain Tregs respond to serotonin. Here. we describe our experiences in the use of Tregs to suppress graft-versus-host disease and to promote neural recovery after stroke.,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:sgsej9ZJWHMC,1,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/kjm/advpub/0/advpub_2019-0003-OA/_article/-char/ja/,17150424193144385100,/scholar?cites=17150424193144385100,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/kjm/advpub/0/advpub_2019-0003-OA/_pdf,0

Tokyo,Inflammation is an essential step in the progression of ischemic stroke pathology. Various mechanisms of innate immunity are implicated in the acute sterile inflammation following ischemic brain injury. Ischemic insults induce the necrotic death of brain cells. which leads to the extracellular release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs are recognised by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in innate immune cells. IL-1β and various neurotoxic mediators are produced by the activation of PRRs. Caspase-1 activation and the formation of inflammasome complex are essential for the production of the active form of IL-1β in ischemic stroke. Recent evidence has supported the use of new therapeutic opportunities for ischemic stroke by targeting DAMPs and inflammasome.

Similarly. juvenile Fabp3−/− mice also contained a higher amount of Vγ4+ γ/δ T cells not only in the skin but in the thymus when compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore. thymic double-negative (DN) cells expressed FABP3. and FABP3 negatively regulates the development of Vγ4+ γ/δ T cells in the thymus. Conclusions: These findings suggest that FABP3 functions as a negative regulator of skin inflammation through limiting pathogenic Vγ4+ γ/δ T-cell generation in the thymus.,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:sJK75vZXtG0C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hai_Phung/publication/345319399_Fatty_acid-binding_protein_3_controls_contact_hypersensitivity_through_regulating_skin_dermal_Vg4_gd_T_cell_in_a_murine_model/links/5fa49261458515157bef963d/Fatty-acid-binding-protein-3-controls-contact-hypersensitivity-through-regulating-skin-dermal-Vg4-g-d-T-cell-in-a-murine-model.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hai_Phung/publication/345319399_Fatty_acid-binding_protein_3_controls_contact_hypersensitivity_through_regulating_skin_dermal_Vg4_gd_T_cell_in_a_murine_model/links/5fa49261458515157bef963d/Fatty-acid-binding-protein-3-controls-contact-hypersensitivity-through-regulating-skin-dermal-Vg4-g-d-T-cell-in-a-murine-model.pdf,0

NY,Adoptive T-cell therapy is an attractive strategy for cancer immunotherapy. The transfer of in vitro expanded tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-specific T cells from patients may effectively fight against the original tumor cells. The chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T (CAR-T) cells are also shown to be a promising therapy for hematologic malignancies. However. one of the limitations of these T-cell-based therapies is a rapid acquisition of tolerant (anergy. deletion. dysfunctional and/or exhausted) phenotypes of T cells during activation in vitro and/or after transfer in vivo. We and others found that stem cell memory T (TSCM) cells are strongly resistant against such tolerance. showing strong expansion and persistence in vivo. and provide long-lasting antitumor effects.

A number of deaths in IPF are related to acute exacerbation in East Asian countries. and survival rate of acute exacerbation is low. therefore. novel therapeutic agents are warranted. Neutrophil numbers are increased in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of IPF patients in acute exacerbation. Interleukin (IL)-23 promotes IL-17A secretion. which induces neutrophilic inflammation. however. the role of IL-23 in acute exacerbation of IPF remains unclear. The objective of this study is to investigate the role of IL-23 for acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis.

CD19-targeted CAR T-cells have exhibited impressive clinical efficacy against B cell leukemias and lymphomas; however. they have been less effective against solid tumors. This is in part because CAR T-cells enter a hyporesponsive (“exhausted” or “dysfunctional”) state that is triggered by chronic antigen stimulation and characterized by upregulation of several inhibitory receptors and loss of effector function. To identify transcriptional regulators and other candidates contributing to the diminished function of CAR T-cells in solid tumors. we developed a CAR T-cell model in which recipient mice bearing murine melanoma tumors expressing the human CD19 antigen were adoptively transferred with CD19-targeted CAR T-cells. Genome-wide analyses of these mouse tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) showed that endogenous CD8+ TILs and CAR T TILs selected for expression of high …,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:PlWzFYVEG4EC,0,https://cancerimmunolres.aacrjournals.org/content/7/2_Supplement/A178.abstract,,,,,0

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are responsible for immune tolerance and are usually activated in secondary lymphatic tissues. Activated Tregs subsequently regulate effector T cell and dendritic cell activation. For clinical applications such as the suppression of both autoimmune diseases and the rejection of transplanted organs. methods to generate stabilized antigen-specific Tregs are required. For this purpose. transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of Foxp3 expression has been investigated. In addition to conventional Tregs. there are some Tregs that reside in tissues and are called tissue Tregs. Tissue Tregs exhibit tissue-specific functions that contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and repair. Such tissue Tregs could also be useful for Treg-based cell therapy. We recently discovered brain Tregs that accumulate in the brain during the chronic phase of ischemic brain injury. Brain Tregs resemble other tissue Tregs. but are unique in expressing neural cell-specific genes such as the serotonin receptor (Htr7); consequently. brain Tregs respond to serotonin. Here. we describe our experiences in the use of Tregs to suppress graft-versus-host disease and to promote neural recovery after stroke.,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:d4tt_xEv1X8C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12277614489551174550&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

In the absence of this molecule. macrophages become extremely prone to an IL-6-dependent expression of arginase-1 (Arg1) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) 2. the prototype markers for alternative or classical macrophage activation. respectively. Because both enzymes are antipodean macrophage effector molecules in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. we assessed the relevance of SOCS3 for macrophage activation during experimental tuberculosis using macrophage-specific SOCS3-deficient (LysMcreSOCS3loxP/loxP) mice. Aerosol infection of LysMcreSOCS3loxP/loxP mice resulted in remarkably higher bacterial loads in infected lungs and exacerbated pulmonary inflammation. This increased susceptibility to Mtb infection was accompanied by enhanced levels of both classical and alternative macrophage activation. However. high Arg1 expression preceded the increased induction of NOS2 and at early time points of infection mycobacteria were mostly found in cells positive for Arg1. This sequential activation of Arg1 and NOS2 expression in LysMcreSOCS3loxP/loxP mice appears to favor the initial replication of Mtb particularly in Arg1-positive cells.

TGF-β acts as a tumor suppressor in premalignant cells. but it is a tumor promoter for cancerous cells. Such dichotomous actions are dictated by different cellular contexts. Here. we have unveiled a PTEN-Smad3 regulatory loop that provides a new insight in the complex cross talk between TGF-β/Smad and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. We demonstrate that TGF-β triggers apoptosis of wild-type polarized endometrial epithelial cells by a Smad3-dependent activation of PTEN transcription. which results in the inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. We show that specific Smad3 knockdown or knockout reduces basal and TGF-β-induced PTEN expression in endometrial cells. resulting in a blockade of TGF-β-induced apoptosis and an enhancement of cell proliferation. Likewise Smad3 deletion. PTEN knockout prevents TGF-β-induced apoptosis and increases cell proliferation by increasing PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. In summary. our results demonstrate that Smad3-PTEN signaling axis determine cellular responses to TGF-β.,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:R-LXmdHK_14C,0,https://repositori.udl.cat/handle/10459.1/63501,,,,https://repositori.udl.cat/bitstream/handle/10459.1/63501/025785.pdf?sequence=4,0

SOCS3 knockout cells phosphorylate p53 and H2AX normally in response to radiation. but fail to upregulate p21 expression. In addition. STAT3 phosphorylation is elevated in SOCS3-deficient cells compared to wild-type cells. Normal G1 arrest can be restored in SOCS3-deficient cells by retroviral transduction of wild-type SOCS3 or a dominant negative mutant of STAT3.ConclusionsOur results suggest a novel function for SOCS3 in the control of genome stability by negatively regulating STAT3-dependent radioresistant DNA synthesis. and promoting p53-dependent p21 expression.,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.redjournal.org/article/S0360-3016(08)02392-4/abstract,,,,https://www.redjournal.org/article/S0360-3016(08)02392-4/pdf,0

We have previously reported that SOCS3 is required for the onset of photoreceptor cell differentiation and Rhodopsin expression in the perinatal retina. Here. we demonstrate an important role of SOCS3 in the adult retina during inflammation.Methods:: SOCS3-deficient and wild-type adult mice were intraperitoneally injected with Lipoplysaccaride (LPS) to induce retinal inflammation.

51401,Spred1 is required for synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning,2008,Tariq Ahmed and E Denayer and A Yoshimura and Detlef Balschun and Rudi D'Hooge,4,FENS abstract,,,,Spred proteins belong to a novel family of evolutionary conserved. negative regulators of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway. Germline mutations in SPRED1 were recently shown to cause a neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-like syndrome in children that included learning difficulties. suggesting SPRED1 to be involved in neural and behavioural plasticity. We investigated hippocampus-dependent learning and memory as well as synaptic plasticity in Spred1 knock-out mice. an animal model of this newly discovered human syndrome. Spred1 knockout mice showed decreased performance in the hidden version of the Morris water maze. but normal basic neuromotor and sensory abilities. When examined for synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region in vitro. Spred1 knockout mice displayed decremental long-term potentiation (LTP) after a single theta-burst stimulation (TBS) returning to baseline values after 55 min. LTP in WT littermates. however. was robust and maintained for at least 4 h. In contrast. LTD induced by a long-train of low-frequency stimulation (2 Hz. 15 min) was very robust in Spred1 knockout mice but only transient in WT mice. The observed imbalance between LTP and LTD in Spred1 knockout mice is likely to be caused by a “pathophysiological” hyperactivation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Thus. delineating this pathway in cognition and synaptic plasticity may open up new therapeutic approaches for NF1-like human disorders.,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:-yGd096yOn8C,0,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/1787984?limo=0,,,,,0

We generated T cell-specific SOCS1-deficient mice and found that these mice were extremely resistant to a Th17-dependent autoimmune disease model. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. SOCS1-deficient naive CD4 T cells were predominantly differentiated into Th1 and poorly into Th17 in vitro.

IL-6 plus TGF-enhanced retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)-t expression and suppressed IFN-production in wild-type T cells. whereas these effects were severely impaired in SOCS1-deficient T cells. These phenotypes can be partly explained by STAT3 suppression by enhanced SOCS3 induction through hyper-STAT1 activation in SOCS1-deficient T cells. In addition. SOCS1-deficient T cells were much less sensitive to TGF-. Suppression of Th1 differentiation by TGF-was impaired in SOCS1-deficient T cells. TGF--mediated Smad transcriptional activity was severely inhibited in SOCS1-deficient cells in the presence of IFN-. Such impairment of TGF-functions were not observed in SOCS3-overexpressed cells. indicating that suppression of Smads was independent of SOCS3. Therefore.

Methods: We generated two strains of WSX-1 transgenic mice in the MRL/lpr background with different expression levels of WSX-1. and investigated the effect of WSX-1 overexpression on survival. glomerulonephritis and immunological properties.Results: In comparison with wild type (WT) MRL/lpr and transgenic (Tg) low (TgL) mice. Tg high (TgH) mice exhibited a prolonged lifespan and no apparent development of autoimmune nephritis. Production of anti-dsDNA antibody and total IgG and IgG2a were significantly lower in TgH mice than those of TgL and WT mice. The expressed amounts of interferon (IFN) c and IL4 mRNA by CD4+ T cells from Tg mice decreased in a dose-dependent fashion. CD4+ splenic lymphocytes in TgH mice were more subject to the IL27-mediated suppression of cytokine production. In vitro stimulation of CD4+ T cells by IL27 resulted in over phosphorylation of STAT3 in TgH cells than in WT cells.Conclusion: WSX-1 overexpression in the MRL/lpr background rendered the autoimmune prone mice protected from the development of autoimmune diseases.

It has been shown that DCs secreting IL-10 induce IL-10 Tr1-type regulatory T (Treg) cells. whereas Foxp3-positive Treg cells are expanded from naive CD4 T cells by coculturing with mature DCs. However. the regulatory mechanism of expansion of Foxp3 Treg cells by DCs has not been clarified. In this study. we demonstrated that suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3-deficient DCs have a strong potential as Foxp3 T cell-inducing tolerogenic DCs. SOCS3/ DCs expressed lower levels of class II MHC. CD40. CD86. and IL-12 than wild-type (WT)-DCs both in vitro and in vivo. and showed constitutive activation of STAT3. Foxp3 effector T cells were predominantly expanded by the priming with WT-DCs. whereas Foxp3 Treg cells were selectively expanded by SOCS3/ DCs. Adoptive transfer of SOCS3/ DCs reduced the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Foxp3 T cell expansion was blocked by anti-TGF-Ab. and SOCS3/ DCs produced higher levels of TGF-than WT-DCs. suggesting that TGF-plays an essential role in the expansion of Foxp3 Treg cells. These results indicate an important role of SOCS3 in determining on immunity or tolerance by DCs.

However little is known. about the tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb2 as a possible regulatory mechanism for Grb2 function. Recently tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb2 is introduced as a mechanism of down-regulation of tyrosine kinase signaling. Here we investigated the role of Grb2 in PRLR signaling. We found that Grb2 is significantly more phosphorylated in response to PRLR stimulation in comparison to EGFR stimulation. We provide evidence demonstrating that a mutant of Grb2 lacking the potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (tyrosines 7. 3752. 209) is able to significantly recover the inhibitory effects of prolactin on EGF-induced MAPK pathway. We mapped the effect to be upstream of Ras activation. Our data indicate that an increase in the pool of phosphorylated Grb2 following prolactin receptor activation will lead to impairment of Grb2sos interaction and ultimately attenuation of the Ras/MAPK activation downstream of EGFR. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb2 is the main mechanism by which secretory mammary epithelial cells escape from the mitogenic signals of EGFR.,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:eFf2swCANGcC,0,https://central.bac-lac.gc.ca/.item?id=NR25209&op=pdf&app=Library&oclc_number=434557420#page=168,,,,https://central.bac-lac.gc.ca/.item?id=NR25209&op=pdf&app=Library&oclc_number=434557420#page=168,0

To define the role of SOCS1-deficient DCs in vivo. we generated mice in which the SOCS1 expression was restored in T and B cells under a SOCS1-/-background. In these mice. DCs were accumulated in the thymus and spleen and produced high levels of BAFF/BLyS. resulting in the aberrant expansion of B cells and autoreactive antibody production. SOCS1-deficient DCs efficiently stimulated B cell proliferation in vitro and auto-antibody production in vivo.

Although previous reports have clarified that IL-27/WSX-1 signaling plays critical roles in both Th1 differentiation and attenuation of cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine production during some bacterial or protozoan infections. little is known about the importance of WSX-1 in cytokine-mediated diseases of allergic origin. To this aim. we took advantage of WSX-1-deficient (WSX-1/) mice and induced experimental asthma. in which Th2 cytokines are central modulators of the pathology. OVA-challenged WSX-1/ mice showed marked enhancement of airway responsiveness with goblet cell hyperplasia. pulmonary eosinophil infiltration. and increased serum IgE levels compared with wild-type mice. Production of Th2 cytokines. which are largely responsible for the pathogenesis of asthma. was augmented in the lung or in the culture supernatants of peribronchial lymph node CD4 T cells from WSX-1/ mice compared with those from wild-type mice. Surprisingly. IFN-production was also enhanced in WSX-1/ mice. albeit at a low concentration. The cytokine overproduction. thus. seems independent from the Th1-promoting property of WSX-1. These results demonstrated that IL-27/WSX-1 also plays an important role in the down-regulation of airway hyper-reactivity and lung inflammation during the development of allergic asthma through its suppressive effect on cytokine production.

These cytokines exert their biological functions through Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs)1 and STAT transcription factors. The CIS (cytokine-inducible SH2 protein) and SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signaling) are a family of intracellular proteins. several of which have emerged as key physiological regulators of cytokine responses. including those that regulate the inflammatory systems. In this review. we focused on the roles of STATs and CIS/SOCS family proteins in inflammatory diseases. Since SOCSs are strongly induced by inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and suppress their effects. regulation of SOCS expression and activities will be a novel therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-3000-6_34,,,,,0

However. molecular mechanism of regulation of IFN signaling has not been fully understood. We have reported novel cytokineinducible SH2 protein (CIS) and JAK binding protein (JAB) family genes that can potentially modulate cytokine signaling. Here we report that JAB is strongly induced by IFN-but not by IFN-in mouse myeloid leukemia M1 cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. NIH-3T3 cells ectopically expressing JAB but not CIS3 lost responsiveness to the antiviral effect of IFN-and IFN-. M1 leukemic cells stably expressing JAB were also resistant to IFN-and IFN-–induced growth arrest. In both NIH-3T3 and M1 transformants expressing JAB. IFN-did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of STAT1. Moreover. IFN-–induced activation of JAK1 and JAK2 and IFN-–induced JAK1 and Tyk2 activation were inhibited in NIH-3T3 JAB transformants. These results suggest that JAB inhibits IFN signaling by blocking JAK activity. We also found that IFN-resistant clones derived from LoVo cells and Daudi cells expressed high levels of JAB without stimulation. In IFN-resistant Daudi cells. IFN-induced STAT1 and JAK phosphorylation was partially reduced.

However. the precise mechanism underlying the cooperative effects of IGF-I is unknown. In a human interleukin-3 or erythropoietin (EPO)-dependent cell line. F-36P. IGF-I alone failed to stimulate DNA synthesis but did augment the EPO-dependent DNA synthesis of F-36P cells. The treatment of F-36P cells with a combination of EPO  and IGF-I (EPO/IGF-I) was found to enhance EPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5. whereas IGF-I alone did not. Furthermore. c-CIS mRNA expression. one of the target molecules of STAT5. was more effectively induced by EPO/IGF-I than by EPO alone.

This enzyme may play a crucial role in nucleic acid metabolism by regulating the availability of thymidine. And dThdPase is considered to activate pyrimidine antimetabolites and to affect sensitivity of anti-tumor drugs such as 5-fluorouracil and its derivatives. tegaful. doxifluridine and carmofur. We purified dThdPase from human placenta and showed that using immunoblottong with antisera against this dThdPase. the dThdPase level in a stomach. a colon and an ovary cancer from human patients were apparently higher than that in the noncancer region of the same surgical sample (4). These results are consistent with the results that several human tumors have higher dThdPase activity than normal tissues (5). Recently we found that 120 amino acids of human dThdPase are identical to the sequence of platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF)[6]. PD-ECGF is a 45-kDa protein that stimulates chemotaxis in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo (7).

Increased expression of mdr 1 mRNA seems to be a common mechanism for multidrug resistance (MDR) in human malignant cells. The product of the mdr 1 gene is P-glycoprotein. The predicted membrane orientation of the protein and homology with bacterial active transport proteins. and capability of the protein to bind hydrophobic anticancer agents are consistent with the function of P-glycoprotein as an energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for MDR phenotype. Most of the hydrophobic agents which overcome MDR are cationic and amphipathic. These agents interact with certain polar lipids and inhibit also the binding of hydrophobic anticancer agents with P-glycoprotein. They might directly bind to the binding site of anticancer agents on P-glycoprotein and competitively inhibit the binding of anticancer agents. Alternatively. they might bind to polar lipids of membrane vesicles and indirectly inhibit the binding ability of the protein to anticancer agents by perturbing the membrane function.,True,kAvrlkAAAAAJ:QaSi33NTfwYC,0,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2888434,,,,,0

Recently. some new subtypes of helper T cells such as iTreg [1] and Th17 [2] have been identified. It is important to understand the control mechanism of helper T cell subtype's balance. The interactions among subtypes are very complicated and so it is difficult to predict the ratio of subtypes. because each subtype produces some cytokines. and its proliferation is accelerated or inhibited by some specific cytokines. Moreover. there are some interactions in Th0 among transcriptional factors which governs differentiation.

Thus. IkB-z-deficient mice develop autoimmune diseases. such as Sj ogren’s syndrome. However. T cells also play a pivotal role in Sj ogren’s syndrome. To study the role of IkB-z in T cells. we generated T cell-specific. IkB-z-deficient mice. We observed increased numbers of peripheral effector/memory CD4+ cells and IFN-g-producing CD4+ cells in 3-week-old mice. We found that IkB-z can be upregulated by TGF-b1 in naıve CD4+ T cells and that it negatively regulates IFN-g expression. In addition. we generated Treg-specific. IkB-z deficient mice and found that IkB-z is dispensable for the plasticity and stability of Tregs. However. Tregs from T cell-specific. IkB-z-deficient mice have reduced immunoregulatory function. Thus. our data reveal a previously unappreciated role for IkB-z in IFN-g production in T cells and the immunoregulatory function of Tregs. J. Leukoc.

Protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) was initially identified as a molecule that inhibits DNA binding of STAT3. and regulates many transcription factors through distinct mechanisms. To analyze PIAS3 function in osteoclasts in vivo. we have generated transgenic mice in which PIAS3 is specifically expressed in the osteoclast lineage using the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) gene promoter. PIAS3 transgenic mice showed an osteopetrotic phenotype due to impairment of osteoclast differentiation. Overexpression of PIAS3 in RAW264. 7 cells suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting the expression of c-Fos and NFATc1. Interestingly. PIAS3 inhibits the transcriptional activity of MITF independent of sumoylation. Downregulation of PIAS3 markedly enhances RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis in RAW264. 7 cells. Furthermore. overexpression of PIAS3 in mouse primary osteoblast (POB). downregulates RANKL expression induced by IL-6 cytokine family. and inhibits osteoclast formation from BMMs in vitro co-culture system.

51517,An RNA-binding protein aCP-1 is involved in the STAT3-mediated suppression of NF-kB transcriptional activity,,Hitomi Nishinakamura and Yasumasa Minoda and Kazuko Saeki and Keiko Koga and Giichi Takaesu and Masafumi Onodera and Akihiko Yoshimura and Takashi Kobayashi,,,,,,Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been shown to mediate the antiinflammatory effect of IL-10. Activated STAT3 suppresses LPS-induced IL-6. tumor necrosis factor-a and IL-12 gene expression in macrophages and dendritic cells. However. the mechanism of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signal suppression by STAT3 has not been clarified. In this study. we investigated the effect of constitutively activated STAT3 (STAT3C) on LPS-induced nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation. The forced expression of STAT3C in HEK293/TLR4 cells. but neither wild-type STAT3 nor dominant-negative form of STAT3. suppressed LPS–TLR4-mediated NF-kB reporter activation. The over-expression of STAT3C did not affect the signal transduction of TLR4. such as the phosphorylation of inhibitory nuclear factor-kBa and mitogen-activated protein kinases and the DNA-binding activity of NF-kB. Thus. STAT3C could suppress the transcriptional and/or translational activity of NF-kB. To define the molecular mechanism. we searched STAT3C-binding proteins by using a proteomic approach and found that a novel RNA-binding protein. aCP-1. interacted with STAT3C. aCP-1 is a K-homology domain-containing RNA-binding protein with specificity for C-rich pyrimidine tracts.

51521,Cardiac excitation–contraction coupling,2002,Donald M Bers,415,,6868,198-205,Nature Publishing Group,Of the ions involved in the intricate workings of the heart. calcium is considered perhaps the most important. It is crucial to the very process that enables the chambers of the heart to contract and relax. a process called excitation–contraction coupling. It is important to understand in quantitative detail exactly how calcium is moved around the various organelles of the myocyte in order to bring about excitation–contraction coupling if we are to understand the basic physiology of heart function.

What controls the strength of contraction of heart muscle? What are the links between cardiac structure and function? How does our understanding of skeletal and smooth muscle and non-muscle cells influence our thinking about force development in the heart? Are there important species differences in how contraction is regulated in the heart? How do the new molecular data fit together in understanding the heart beat? What goes wrong in ischemia. hypertrophy. and heart failure? This book paints a modernportrait'of how the heart works and in this picture the author shows a close-up of the structural. biochemical. and physiological links between excitation and contraction. The author takes the reader through a series of important. interrelated topics with great clarity and continuity and also includes many useful illustrations and tables. The book starts by considering the cellular structures involved in excitation-contraction coupling and then described the characteristics of the myofilaments as the end effector of excitation-contraction coupling. A general scheme of calcium regulation is described and the possible sources and sinks of calcium are discussed in simple. but quantitative terms. The cardiac action potential and its many underlying currents are reviewed. Then the characteristics of some key calcium transport systems (calcium channels. sodium/calcium exchange and SR calcium uptake and release) are discussed in detail. This is then built into a more integrated picture of calcium regulation in succeeding chapters by detailed discussions of excitation-calcium coupling mechanisms (in skeletal. cardiac. and …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2700,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=00PLwEsg1ccC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:Cc8HSWdipTYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=av9yHoit8X&sig=vYqWw1aBYFoyaekYNmHaFxHe0qU,3937661644951768841,/scholar?cites=3937661644951768841,,,0

In a rabbit HF model reproducing these same aspects of human HF. we demonstrate that a 2-fold functional upregulation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange (NaCaX) unloads sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores. reducing Ca2+ transients and contractile function. Whereas β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) are progressively downregulated in HF. residual β-AR responsiveness at this critical HF stage allows SR Ca2+ load to increase. causing spontaneous SR Ca2+ release and transient inward current carried by NaCaX. A given Ca2+ release produces greater arrhythmogenic inward current in HF (as a result of NaCaX upregulation). and ≈50% less Ca2+ release is required to trigger an action potential in HF.

To study and understand these myriad Ca2+-dependent functions requires control and measurement of [Ca2+] in the nano- to micromolar range (where contaminating Ca2+ is a significant problem). As with pH. it is often essential to use Ca2+ buffers to control free [Ca2+] at the desired biologically relevant concentrations. Fortunately. there are numerous available Ca2+ buffers with different affinities that make this practical.

Delayed afterdepolarizations are thought to be due to spontaneous release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and consequent activation of an inward Na+/Ca2+ exchange (NaCaX) current. The goal of this study was to determine whether there is enhanced NaCaX gene expression and functional activity that may contribute to nonreentrant activation.

Extracellular double-barreled Ca-selective microelectrodes were used to assess transsarcolemmal Ca influx. In rabbit ventricle. T at the first postrest beat (B1) exceeded T at the second beat (B2). T and Ca influx then increase toward steady state in a parallel fashion. Since Ca influx is small at B1. this beat may be more dependent on Ca stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). and subsequent beats may more closely reflect Ca influx. We have examined this hypothesis using agents that may preferentially inhibit either SR Ca release or Ca influx.

While changes of other components contribute. it is generally agreed that much of the contractile deficit is due to reduced myocyte Ca2+ transients. 1. 2 Alterations in Ca2+ current (ICa) and action potential characteristics are also seen in HF. but a central factor limiting Ca2+ transient amplitude is a decrease of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content. 3–6 HF is extremely complex. but it is easy to appreciate how reduced SR Ca2+ content would reduce SR Ca2+ release. myofilament activation. and contractility.

The relationship between channel structure. associated proteins and function of these Ca channels is discussed. The sarcolemmal Ca channels are crucial both to the basic cellular electrophysiological properties and control of cardiac contractility (via excitation–contraction coupling). The intracellular Ca release channels (or ryanodine receptors) respond to triggering events mediated by sarcolemmal ion currents and are largely responsible for releasing Ca which activates the myofilaments to produce contraction. Several possible mechanisms of excitation–contraction coupling are discussed.

This highly coordinated process. termed excitation–contraction coupling or ECC. is based on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In recent years it has become increasingly clear that several Ca2+-dependent proteins contribute to the fine tuning of ECC. One of these is the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) of which CaMKII is the predominant cardiac isoform. During ECC CaMKII phosphorylates several Ca2+ handling proteins with multiple functional consequences. CaMKII may also be co-localized to distinct target proteins.

51585,Cardiac myocytes Ca2+ and Na+ regulation in normal and failing hearts,2006,Donald M Bers and Sanda Despa,100,,5,315-322,The Japanese Pharmacological Society,Ca 2+ is a central player in the excitation-contraction coupling of cardiac myocytes. the process that enables the heart to contract and relax. Mishandling of Ca 2+ is a central cause of both contractile dysfunction and arrhythmias in pathophysiological conditions such as heart failure (HF). Upon electrical excitation. Ca 2+ enters the myocytes via voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels and induces further Ca 2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This raises the free intracellular Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+] i). activating contraction. Relaxation is driven by [Ca 2+] i decline. mainly due to re-uptake into the SR via SR Ca 2+-ATPase and extrusion via the sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchange. NCX. Intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+] i) is a main regulator of NCX. and thus [Na+] i plays an important role in controlling the cytosolic and SR [Ca 2+].[Na+] i may have an even more important role in HF because NCX is generally upregulated. There are several pathways for Na+ entry into the cells. whereas the Na+/K+ pump (NKA) is the main Na+ extrusion pathway and therefore is essential in maintaining the transmembrane Na+ gradient. Phospholemman is an important regulator of NKA function (decreasing [Na+] i affinity unless it is phosphorylated).

We measured intracellular Ca2+ transients during rapid cooling contractures (RCCs) in guinea‐pig ventricular myocytes using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator. Indo‐1. 2. Rapid cooling of myocytes from 22 to 0‐1 degrees C induced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i which preceded the peak of the contraction and was sometimes large enough to saturate Indo‐1. This indicates that [Ca2+]i may reach greater than 10 microM during an RCC. 3. The [Ca2+]i during the RCC slowly declined from its peak value and most of this decline in [Ca2+]i can be attributed to slow reaccumulation of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the cold.

Total cytosolic calcium was calculated from the latter part of [Ca]i decline using rate constants for cellular calcium buffers. Intra-SR calcium buffering characteristics were also deduced. We found that the net SR calcium pump flux and rate of [Ca]i decline decreased as the SR free [Ca] rose. with pump parameters held constant.

The extracted phospholipid vesicles account for a large fraction of the sarcolemmal Ca2+ binding which suggests that other sarcolemmal components (e.g. protein and sialic acid) bind lesser amounts of Ca2+. Removal of sialic acid (57%) with neuraminidase decreases Ca2+ binding of sarcolemma by about 13%. The ability of different pure phospholipid vesicles to bind Ca2+ is assessed. This. together with sarcolemmal phospholipid analysis. suggests that phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol are important Ca2+-binding molecules in cardiac sarcolemma.

The observation of this correlation in the three former tissues and under various ionic conditions suggests that this correlation is not coincidental and that Ca2+ bound to the cardiac sarcolemma is of major importance in the control of myocardial contractility. The data are consistent with a functional Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release system in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of all the tissues (which is controlled by Ca2+ entry from sarcolemmal sites). with the adult rat ventricular and rabbit atrial SR Ca2+ release being much more sensitive to CA2+.

Contaminating currents through Na+ and K+ channels were eliminated by using Na+- and K+-free solutions. respectively. DIDS (0.2 mmol/L) was used to block Ca2+-activated chloride current (ICl(Ca)). When the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was depleted of Ca2+ by preexposure to 10 mmol/L caffeine. total Ca2+ entry via ICa during the AP was ≈12 μmol/L cytosol (at both 25°C and 35°C).

Muscles were exposed to a Na-free medium for 15 min. during which time a transient contracture developed and relaxed back to the resting tension level. Muscles were then either exposed to 20 mM caffeine or rapidly cooled to less than 5 degrees C. both of which produced large contractures. The magnitudes of those contractures are believed to be a relative index of SR Ca content. Reduction of extracellular [Ca] from 2 to 0.2 mM did not significantly alter the magnitude of either Na-free caffeine contractures or RCC. These are not the maximum contractures that can be obtained.

Effects of compartmentalization,2001,Donald M Bers and Mark T Ziolo,89,,5,373-375,Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,Many important cellular processes are controlled via stimulation (or inhibition) of signal transduction systems. among which heptahelical G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) figure prominently. A classical example in cardiac myocytes is the ß-adrenergic receptor (ß-AR) cascade (see Figure. panel A). which leads to positive inotropic and lusitropic effects. 1 Occupation of the ß-ARs by an agonist activates a GTP binding protein (Gs). such that the α subunit dissociates and activates adenylyl cyclase (AC). thereby producing cAMP. The increase in cAMP leads to the dissociation of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA can be tethered near its substrates by an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP).

Previous studies have linked lethal familial arrhythmogenic disorders to mutations in the ryanodine receptor and calsequestrin genes. which interact with junctin and triadin to form a macromolecular Ca-signaling complex. The essential physiological effects of junctin and its potential regulatory roles in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca cycling and Ca-dependent cardiac functions. such as myocyte contractility and automaticity. are unknown.Methods and Results— The junctin gene was targeted in embryonic stem cells. and a junctin-deficient mouse was generated.

The sarcolemmal calcium pump and mitochondrial calcium uptake are much slower. but may also participate in [Ca] i regulation. The aim of this study was to provide a clearer understanding of the interaction of these mechanisms. Myocyte shortening and [Ca] i transients (using indo-1 fluorescence) were measured in rabbit ventricular myocytes. with similar results. The t1/2 of twitch relaxation was 0.17 (SEM 0.03) s. Contractures induced by 10 mM caffeine (caffeine contraction) relaxed more slowly [t1/2= 0.54 (0.07) s] due to prevention of sarcoplasmic reticular calcium uptake. When the Na/Ca exchange was also blocked by perfusion with 0Na. 0Ca solution. the peak of the caffeine contraction was increased (by 44%) and relaxation was slowed about 16-fold [t1/2= 8.8 (0.8) s]. Blocking mitochondrial calcium uptake by including 1 microM FCCP+ 1 microM oligomycin in the 0Na. 0Ca solution slowed the relaxation of the caffeine contraction further [t1/2= 19.7 (3.2) s]. Inhibition of the sarcolemmal calcium pump by perfusion with 0Na. 10 mM Ca during caffeine contraction also increased the relaxation t1/2 to 27.5 (6.9) s. Inhibition of all four calcium transport systems almost abolished relaxation. It is also shown that calcium which was taken up by the mitochondria during relaxation of the caffeine contraction in 0Na. 0Ca gradually redistributed (with tau= 41 s) back to the sarcoplasmic reticulum after caffeine was removed.

Myocardial contractility. an important determinant of cardiac output. must be maintained and regulated in these species under conditions that are cardioplegic to mammals. Contractility is determined primarily by the magnitude and rate of calcium delivery to the myofilaments.

Preserved β‐adrenergic responsiveness in HF plays a crucial role in increasing SR Ca load. leading to SR Ca release and activation of Iti.

When repetitive stimulation was stopped there was a slow loss of cellular Ca. Upon resumption of stimulation Ca was taken up by the cells. These Ca movements are thought to represent the loss of Ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the cell during rest and the refilling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum during stimulation. Ryanodine (100 nM) greatly enhanced both the efflux of Ca during rest and the uptake of Ca induced by stimulation. These results are consistent with the conclusions drawn below. but they are dependent upon the interpretation that these extracellular Ca depletions are indicative of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca movements.

Ca extrusion via Na-Ca exchange is Em-sensitive. whereas Ca uptake by the SR is not. Neither the sarcolemmal Ca-ATPase pump nor mitochondrial Ca uptake appear to contribute significantly to the decline of [Ca] i during relaxation. Furthermore. the diastolic efflux of Ca from cardiac muscle cells appears to be primarily attributable to Na-Ca exchange and not the sarcolemmal Ca-ATPase pump. In rabbit ventricle Ca entry via Na-Ca exchange is favored thermodynamically during much of a normal twitch contraction and Ca extrusion occurs primarily between beats. In rat ventricle Ca efflux via Na-Ca exchange occurs during the contraction and net Ca influx may occur between beats. This fundamental difference in Ca fluxes during the cardiac cycle in rat versus rabbit ventricle may be a simple consequence of the shorter action potential duration and higher aNai in rat ventricle (due to the effects of Em and [Na] and [Ca] gradients on Na-Ca exchange).,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC,68,https://europepmc.org/article/med/1785864,11739873512916816702,/scholar?cites=11739873512916816702,,,0

Beta-adrenergic (β-AR) tone is known to increase this leak through the activation of Ca-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) and the subsequent phosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor. When β-AR drive is chronic. as observed in heart failure. this CaMKII-dependent effect is exaggerated and becomes potentially arrhythmogenic. Recent evidence has indicated that CaMKII activation can be regulated by cellular oxidizing agents. such as reactive oxygen species. Here. we investigate how the cellular second messenger. nitric oxide. mediates CaMKII activity downstream of the adrenergic signaling cascade and promotes the generation of arrhythmogenic spontaneous Ca2+ waves in intact cardiomyocytes.

In ferret. recovery of twitch and caffeine‐induced contracture required fewer twitches than in rabbit or rat. In rat. there was no difference in action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) at steady state (SS) versus at the first post‐depletion (PD) twitch. The SS APD90 was similar in ferret and rabbit (but longer than in rat). However. compared to SS. the PD APD90 was lengthened in ferret. but shortened in rabbit.

GRK5’s newly discovered kinase activity on histone deacetylase 5 induces hypertrophic gene transcription. The mechanisms governing the nuclear targeting of GRK5 are unknown. We report here that GRK5 nuclear accumulation is dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) binding to a specific site within the amino terminus of GRK5 and this interaction occurs after selective activation of hypertrophic Gq-coupled receptors. Stimulation of myocytes with phenylephrine or angiotensinII causes GRK5 to leave the sarcolemmal membrane and accumulate in the nucleus. while the endothelin-1 does not cause nuclear GRK5 localization. A mutation within the amino-terminus of GRK5 negating CaM binding attenuates GRK5 movement from the sarcolemma to the nucleus and. importantly. overexpression of this mutant does not facilitate cardiac hypertrophy and related gene transcription in vitro and in vivo.

51788,Ca regulation in cardiac muscle.,1991,Donald M Bers,23,,10,1157-1162,,Contraction in cardiac muscle is activated by a combination of Ca influx via sarcolemmal Ca channels and release of Ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The release of Ca from the SR appears to be triggered by Ca influx via a Ca-induced Ca-release mechanism. The amount of Ca influx and Ca released from the SR vary with conditions and with different cardiac muscle preparations. In contrast to the Ca-induced Ca-release process in cardiac muscle. excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle appears to be via a more direct coupling between sarcolemmal voltage sensors and the Ca release (sometimes referred to as depolarization-induced Ca-release). During cardiac relaxation Ca is removed from the cytoplasm by the SR Ca-pump and the sarcolemmal Na/Ca exchange (with the former being somewhat more dominant). Ca extrusion from the cell during both relaxation and diastole is predominantly via Na/Ca exchange. with the sarcolemmal Ca ATPase pump contributing very little.

These specific activities are demonstrated both              in vitro              and in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Activation of CaMKII signaling by hypertrophic agonists increases H3 phosphorylation in primary cardiac cells and is accompanied by concomitant cellular hypertrophy.

Resumption of stimulation after a rest interval produces a cumulative decrease of extracellular free calcium often by more than 10% (with bulk extracellular free calcium = 0.2 mM). The extracellular free calcium returns to the bulk value as a new steady state is achieved. The changes of extracellular free calcium recorded presumably represent net calcium uptake and loss by cardiac muscle cells. These cumulative extracellular free calcium depletions are blocked by 0.5 mM cobalt and 1 microM nifedipine and are increased to 167 +/- 11% of control by the calcium agonist Bay k 8644 (1 microM) and to 620 +/- 150% of control by increasing stimulus frequency from 0.2-2 Hz.

51818,Ca2+ current facilitation is CaMKII-dependent and has arrhythmogenic consequences,2014,Donald M Bers and Stefano Morotti,5,,,144,Frontiers,The cardiac voltage gated Ca2+ current (ICa) is critical to the electrophysiological properties. excitation-contraction coupling. mitochondrial energetics and transcriptional regulation in heart. Thus. it is not surprising that cardiac ICa is regulated by numerous pathways. This review will focus on changes in ICa that occur during the cardiac action potential (AP). with particular attention to Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI). Ca2+-dependent facilitation (CDF) and how calmodulin (CaM) and Ca2+-CaM dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) participate in the regulation of Ca2+ current during the cardiac AP. CDI depends on CaM pre-bound to the C-terminal of the L-type Ca2+ channel. such that Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum bind to that CaM and cause CDI. In cardiac myocytes CDI normally predominates over voltage-dependent inactivation. The decrease in ICa via CDI provides direct negative feedback on the overall Ca2+ influx during a single beat. when myocyte Ca2+ loading is high. CDF builds up over several beats. depends on CaMKII-dependent Ca2+ channel phosphorylation and results in a staircase of increasing ICa peak. with progressively slower inactivation. CDF and CDI co-exist and in combination may fine-tune the ICa waveform during the cardiac AP. CDF may partially compensate for the tendency for Ca2+ channel availability to decrease at higher heart rates because of accumulating inactivation. CDF may also allow some reactivation of ICa during long duration cardiac APs. and contribute to early afterdepolarizations. a form of triggered arrhythmias.,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:owLR8QvbtFgC,43,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2014.00144/full,15266515833243378621,/scholar?cites=15266515833243378621,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2014.00144/full,0

51824,Formation of spatially discordant alternans due to fluctuations and diffusion of calcium,2013,Daisuke Sato and Donald M Bers and Yohannes Shiferaw,8,PloS one,12,e85365,Public Library of Science,Spatially discordant alternans (SDA) of action potential duration (APD) is a phenomenon where different regions of cardiac tissue exhibit an alternating sequence of APD that are out-of-phase. SDA is arrhythmogenic since it can induce spatial heterogeneity of refractoriness. which can cause wavebreak and reentry. However. the underlying mechanisms for the formation of SDA are not completely understood. In this paper. we present a novel mechanism for the formation of SDA in the case where the cellular instability leading to alternans is caused by intracellular calcium (Ca) cycling. and where Ca transient and APD alternans are electromechanically concordant. In particular. we show that SDA is formed when rapidly paced cardiac tissue develops alternans over many beats due to Ca accumulation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The mechanism presented here relies on the observation that Ca cycling fluctuations dictate Ca alternans phase since the amplitude of Ca alternans is small during the early stages of pacing. Thus. different regions of a cardiac myocyte will typically develop Ca alternans which are opposite in phase at the early stages of pacing. These subcellular patterns then gradually coarsen due to interactions with membrane voltage to form steady state SDA of voltage and Ca on the tissue scale. This mechanism for SDA is distinct from well-known mechanisms that rely on conduction velocity restitution. and a Turing-like mechanism known to apply only in the case where APD and Ca alternans are electromechanically discordant. Furthermore. we argue that this mechanism is robust. and is likely to underlie a wide range of …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C,41,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085365,2497579581509316205,/scholar?cites=2497579581509316205,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085365,0

51830,Na+ transport in cardiac myocytes; Implications for excitation‐contraction coupling,2009,Donald M Bers and Sanda Despa,61,,3,215-221,Wiley Subscription Services. Inc.. a Wiley company,Intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) is very important in modulating the contractile and electrical activity of the heart. Upon electrical excitation of the myocardium. voltage‐dependent Na+ channels open. triggering the upstroke of the action potential (AP). During the AP. Ca2+ enters the myocytes via L‐type Ca2+ channels. This triggers Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and thus activates contraction. Relaxation occurs when cytosolic Ca2+ declines. mainly due to re‐uptake into the SR via SR Ca2+‐ATPase and extrusion from the cell via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). NCX extrudes one Ca2+ ion in exchange for three Na+ ions and its activity is critically regulated by [Na+]i. Thus. via NCX. [Na+]i is centrally involved in the regulation of intracellular [Ca2+] and contractility. Na+ brought in by Na+ channels.

We have measured the effect of the aglycone acetylstrophanthidin (ACS) on twitches. cooling contractures and microscopic tension fluctuations in rabbit ventricular muscle. 2. Both developed twitches and cooling contractures are strengthened by applications of ACS in the range 1‐4 microM. This positive inotropy averages 150‐160% of control (zero ACS) in both twitches and cooling contractures. Cooling contracture magnitude is assumed to reflect the availability of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ for contraction (Bridge. 1986). We infer that ACS increases the availability of SR Ca2+ by enlarging SR Ca2+ stores and this may contribute to the positive inotropy. 3.

To differentiate VDI and CDI. several experimental and theoretical studies have considered the inactivation of Ba current through LTCC (IBa) as a measure of VDI. However. there is evidence that Ba can weakly mimic Ca. such that IBa inactivation is still a mixture of CDI and VDI. To avoid this complication. some have used the monovalent cation current through LTCC (INS). which can be measured when divalent cation concentrations are very low. Notably. INS inactivation rate does not depend on current amplitude. and hence may reflect purely VDI. However. based on analysis of existent and new data. and modeling. we find that INS can inactivate more rapidly and completely than IBa. especially at physiological temperature.

51847,Effects of rest duration and ryanodine on changes of extracellular [Ca] in cardiac muscle from rabbits,1987,KENNETH T MAcLEOD and Donald M Bers,253,American Journal of Physiology-Cell Physiology,3,C398-C407,American Physiological Society,Cumulative depletions of extracellular Ca were measured using double-barreled Ca-sensitive microelectrodes in the extracellular space of rabbit ventricular muscle. Depletions were produced by 1-Hz stimulation after rest intervals of 10 s to 10 min. With longer rest intervals. depletion size increased while the first postrest contraction decreased in a reciprocal manner. The depletions may represent refilling of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca stores that have become partially depleted of Ca during the rest.

In large mammals the positive action potential plateau promotes ICaL reactivation. and the current paradigm holds that cardiac EAD dynamics are dominated by interaction between ICaL and the repolarizing K+ currents.

Using mice with genetic ablation of calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II δ (CaMKIIδ). which are resistant to pathological cardiac stress. we show that CaMKIIδ regulates the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine‐10 during pressure overload hypertrophy. H3 S10 phosphorylation is strongly increased in the adult mouse heart in the early phase of cardiac hypertrophy and remains detectable during cardiac decompensation.

Important cellular changes include increased sensitivity of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) to Ca2+ release and down‐regulation of the inward rectifying K+ current (IK1). both of which contribute to triggered action potentials in isolated cells. We studied the role of increased RyR sensitivity and decreased IK1 in contributing to focal arrhythmia in the intact non‐failing rabbit heart using optical mapping and pharmacological manipulation of RyRs and IK1.

This decapeptide (KKERKLARTA) is a fragment of the cardiac dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) from the cytosolic loop between the second and third transmembrane domains (II‐III loop). Studies were carried out in ferret ventricular myocytes by simultaneously applying ruptured‐patch voltage clamp and line‐scan confocal microscopy with fluo‐3 to measure intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) and Ca2+ sparks.  2 Inclusion of Ac‐10C in the dialysing pipette solution inhibited resting Ca2+ spark frequency (due to diastolic RyR openings) by > 50 %. This occurred without changing sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content. which was measured via the caffeine‐induced Ca2+ transient amplitude and the caffeine‐induced Na+‐Ca2+ exchange current (INCX) integral.

51927,Na/Ca exchange and the sarcolemmal Ca-pump,2001,Donald M Bers,,,,133-160,Springer. Dordrecht,The two known mechanisms responsible for extrusion of Ca from cardiac myocytes are the sarcolemmal Ca-ATPase pump and Na/Ca exchange. A plasma membrane Ca-pump was first reported in erythrocytes (Schatzmann. 1966). but is ubiquitous (Schatzmann. 1982. 1989; Carafoli & Stauffer. 1993; Guerini et al.. 1998). The red cell plasma membrane Ca-pump has been most extensively characterized and appears closely related to that in other tissues. Two key features of the Ca-pump are its stimulation by Ca-calmodulin and by PKA-dependent phosphorylation. The plasma membrane Ca-pump is a P-type ATPase (like the Na/K-ATPase. H/K- ATPase and the SR Ca-ATPase). That is. it transfers the energy of ATP to a high energy phosphorylated intermediate (aspartyl residue). energy which is then used in the ion transport step (e.g. Figs 44 & 83).

51928,Ca influx via sarcolemmal Ca channels,2001,Donald M Bers,,,,101-132,Springer. Dordrecht,Since the time of Ringer (1883) it has been known that extracellular [Ca] is important in cardiac muscle contraction. Cardiac Ca currents were first characterized as “slow inward current” or Isi. since several tens of msec were required for peak current to be achieved (e.g. Rougier et al.. 1969; Mascher & Peper. 1969; Beeler & Reuter. 1970; Ochi. 1970). Since the advent of the patch-clamp and isolated myocyte techniques it is now clear that Ca current (ICa) can reach a peak value in ~2–3 msec after a depolarization (e.g. see Fig 50). Thus the moniker of slow inward current seems inappropriate. although ICa could be considered secondary. in deference to INa which activates still faster than ICa (Fig 45). The inward ICa during the normal cardiac action potential contributes to the AP plateau and is also involved in the activation of contraction (directly and/or indirectly).,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC,16,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-010-0658-3_5,1207648766430054491,/scholar?cites=1207648766430054491,,,0

The primary function of ANT proteins is to exchange cytosolic ADP with matrix ATP. facilitating the export of newly synthesized ATP to the cell while providing new ADP substrate to the mitochondria. As such. the ANT proteins are central to maintaining energy homeostasis in all eukaryotic cells. Evidence also suggests that the ANTs constitute a pore-forming component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). a structure that forms in the inner mitochondrial membrane that is thought to underlie regulated necrotic cell death. Additionally. emerging studies suggest that ANT proteins are also critical for mitochondrial uncoupling and for promoting mitophagy.

Several agents are often used to interfere with mitochondrial Ca transport. but the use of these agents in intact cells is complicated by lack of knowledge about how rapidly these agents gain access to intracellular mitochondria. We have developed a novel method to assess the time course with which extracellularly applied inhibitors gain access to mitochondria in intact ventricular myocytes preloaded with the fluorescent Ca indicator indo-1-AM.

51937,Dynamics of sodium current mediated early afterdepolarizations,2017,Daisuke Sato and Colleen E Clancy and Donald M Bers,3,Heliyon,9,e00388,Elsevier,Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) have been attributed to two primary mechanisms: 1) recovery from inactivation of the L-type calcium (Ca) channel and/or 2) spontaneous Ca release. which depolarizes the membrane potential through the electrogenic sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX). The sodium (Na) current (INa). especially the late component of the Na current. has been recognized as an important player to set up the conditions for EADs by reducing repolarization reserve and increasing intracellular Na concentration. which leads to Ca overload. However. INa itself has not been considered as a direct initiator of EADs. A recent experimental study by Horvath et al. has shown that the amplitude of the late component of the Na current is as large as potassium (K) and Ca currents (∼1 pA/pF). This result suggests that INa by itself can exceeds the sum of outward currents and depolarize the membrane potential.

Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,,159-85,,The rapid propagation of the cardiac impulse from the pacemaker cells of the sinus node to the ventricular cells is largely dependent on the activity of sodium and calcium channels. When the impulse has reached the ventricular cells. the next event of critical importance is the voltage-induced increased opening of the calcium channels of contractile cells of the ventricles. followed by a series of intracellular movements of calcium ions. leading to myocardial contraction and relaxation (Fig. 6-1). Contraction must be followed by relaxation. which results from uptake of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Only small amounts of calcium ions actually enter and leave the cell with each cardiac cycle. Most calcium ion movements are from the calcium stores in the SR to the cytosol and back again (Fig. 6-2). The sarcolemma maintains a vast gradient of calcium ion concentration from the extracellular value of approximately 1 mmol/L (10-3 mol/L) to intracellular cytosolic values. which increase from diastolic values of approximately 10-7mol/L (0.15 umol/L (3) to systolic values of approximately 10-mol/L or possibly more during maximal contraction (Fig. 6-3). The free calcium concentration in the SR is approximately 10-mol/L (3). reflecting active uptake of calcium into the SR.

This can increase diastolic [Ca] i. sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca content and the amplitude of the Ca transient amplitude. leading to a positive inotropic effect. However. the therapeutic range is limited because if SR Ca content gets too high (glycoside toxicity). spontaneous SR Ca releases during diastole can activate inward Na/Ca exchange current leading to delayed after depolarizations and triggered arrhythmias.

51951,Measurement of calcium transport in heart using modern approaches.,1996,Donald M Bers,4,,1,36-44,,Cellular Ca balance and the dynamic Ca fluxes which occur during each cardiac cycle are complicated by numerous and interdependent different Ca transport systems and binding sites in cardiac myocytes. Since alterations in cellular Ca regulation can be crucial determinants of cardiac dysfunction (both mechanical and arrhythmogenic). it is important to have a fairly clear and somewhat quantitative fundamental understanding of how these systems interact in the intact ventricular myocyte. Several different methods are described for the measurement of Ca fluxes in cardiac myocytes: Ca electrodes. voltage/patch clamp. and fluorescent indicators. With these tools. the roles of Ca entry via Ca current and Na/Ca exchange and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release are discussed in terms of the activation of contraction. The relative roles of Ca removal during relaxation via the SR Ca-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). Na/Ca exchange. sarcolemmal Ca-ATPase. and mitochondrial uniporter are also evaluated quantitatively (with the first two being dominant). There are also significant species-dependent differences in the Ca fluxes (where the SR Ca-ATPase is stronger in rat than rabbit and the converse is true for the Na/Ca exchange). There are even differences in the direction of net Ca transport across the cell membrane during the cardiac cycle. In the steady state. it is also clear that the amount of Ca which enters the cell during each cycle must equal the amount extruded from the cell in order to maintain a steady state and prevent progressive Ca overload or loss. In this context. it appears that the amount of Ca which enters the cell via Ca …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC,11,https://europepmc.org/article/med/8689274,10589983511611372313,/scholar?cites=10589983511611372313,,,0

51971,Calcium chelators and calcium ionophores,1988,DM Bers and KT MacLeod,,,,491-507,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,The preceding chapters in this volume have demonstrated that Ca ions play critical roles in the regulation of a very large number of physiologic. pharmacologic. and biochemical processes. In the study of these processes. it is invariably necessary to control and measure or monitor the free [Ca2+] with a high degree of precision. Many of these processes are sensitive to submicromolar levels of Ca2+. where endogenous or contaminant Ca2+ can become a significant problem. Therefore. in these instances it becomes especially important to control the concentration of free calcium with buffers. Thus. calcium chelators have played a crucial role in allowing progress in the understanding of Ca2+-regulated processes. Chelators are extensively utilized to buffer free [Ca2+] just as pH buffers are utilized to buffer low concentrations of protons. Calcium chelators which exhibit changes in their optical properties can be …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC,8,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-71806-9_23,5655600998386335114,/scholar?cites=5655600998386335114,,,0

Assessment by extracellular Ca microelectrodes.,1985,Donald M Bers and DB Merrill,6,Advances in myocardiology,,49-57,,Tension. dT/dt. and extracellular free [Ca][(Ca] 0) were continuously measured in isolated rabbit right papillary muscles at 28 degrees C. Double-barreled Ca-selective microelectrodes incorporating Simon's neutral Ca exchange resin (ETH-1001) were used to monitor [Ca] 0. Decreases of [Ca] 0 were seen during the course of single twitches. before the development of significant tension. This depletion of Ca0 probably represents Ca influx into the cells from the extracellular space. The magnitude of this Ca0 depletion is decreased by Co. verapamil. long rest intervals. and reduction of [Ca] 0. The magnitude is increased by catecholamines. reduction of [Na] 0. caffeine. continued pacing. and elevation of [Ca] 0. After 3-min rest. stimulation (0.5-1 Hz) produces a biphasic tension response (larger first beat. small second beat. and monotonic rise to control). Caffeine (5 mM) changes the pattern after rest to a monotonic increase. Ca influx increases monotonically in both cases. Addition of 20 mM Co during the rest reduces tension of all beats by similar amounts in the presence of caffeine. In the absence of caffeine. Co has a much weaker effect on the first beat than on subsequent beats. The results suggest that caffeine inhibits an intracellular component of activator Ca that is more important after a rest interval. but that Ca influx becomes increasingly more important during continued pacing under the conditions used here.,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC,8,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2581299,13019663388043574225,/scholar?cites=13019663388043574225,,,0

The isoform that predominates in heart. CaMKIIδ. directly regulates expression and function of several of the main cardiac ion channels and Ca2+ handling proteins (Bers and Grandi. 2009). CaMKII-dependent effects are thought to orchestrate many of the electrophysiologic and contractile adaptations to common cardiac stressors. such as rapid pacing. adrenergic stimulation. and oxidative challenge. In the context of disease. CaMKII has been shown to contribute to a remarkably wide variety of cardiac pathologies. including myocardial hypertrophy. ischemia. heart failure (HF). and arrhythmia. CaMKII expression is increased in patients with HF (Hoch et al.. 1999). and elevated CaMKII expression and activity have been implicated in the transition to HF (Zhang et al.. 2003). Indeed. inhibiting CaMKII appears to reduce arrhythmias and pathological signaling. which makes this kinase a promising new therapeutic target (Anderson et al.. 2011).,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:FsLZdJ3BAzkC,7,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2014.00154/full,10523420545688857668,/scholar?cites=10523420545688857668,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2014.00154/full,0

Although abnormal Ca 2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through ryanodine receptors (RyR2) has been linked to arrhythmogenesis. the molecular mechanisms triggering release of arrhythmogenic Ca 2+ remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis that increased RyR2 phosphorylation by Ca 2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is both necessary and sufficient to promote lethal ventricular arrhythmias.Methods and ResultsMice in which the S2814 CaMKII site on RyR2 is constitutively activated (S2814D) develop pathological SR Ca 2+ release events resulting in reduced SR Ca 2+ load on confocal microscopy.

Cham,The vast majority of theoretical and numerical studies of buoyancy-thermocapillary convection use one-sided models [9. 19–22] that only consider the convection in the liquid phase. while ignoring transport through the gas phase and the phase change across the liquid-gas interface. The heat and mass transport in the gas phase are incorporated indirectly through boundary conditions at the liquid-gas interface. and the interface is assumed to be rigid (and. in most of the cases. flat). Such an approach might be justifiable for nonvolatile liquids. since air is a relatively poor conductor of heat. and for the volatile liquids at ambient (atmospheric) conditions when phase change is strongly suppressed.

During ischaemia. the concentration of intracellular Na+([Na+] i) rises because of a combination of increased Na+ entry via Na+/H+ exchange and tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channels and reduced extrusion via Na+/K+-ATPase (as ATP and phosphocreatine are gradually depleted and ΔGATP declines). The rise in [Na+] i contributes to cellular Ca2+ gain via shifts in Na+/Ca2+ exchange. and thus elevation of diastolic [Ca2+] i.

Group II muscles showed a shorter action potential with a higher plateau phase and was prolonged by 0.1 μm ryanodine (from 175±7 (9) ms to 236±18 (9) ms) No significant difference in the mechanical response to ryanodine was observed between the two groups.

However. overuse of usnic acid has been related with severe hepatotoxicity. making its use questionable. In this study. we decided to expand the knowledge of usnic acid biological activities by characterizing its effects on the mammalian myocardium as a potential pharmacological target. Usnic acid was isolated from samples of Cladonia substellataand submitted to chemical characterization. Molecular inclusion complexes of usnic acid with hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin were prepared to improve its water solubility. The effects of usnic acid on the atrial contractility and Ca2+ influx were carried out in the left atrium of guinea pigs and the effect of usnic acid on the L-type Ca2+ current was performed in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes enzymatically isolated. To evaluate the membrane integrity of cells subjected to usnic acid. we used histological procedures. Usnic acid reduced atrial contraction with an EC50 of 43.0±1.0 μM. This effect was related to a reduction of Ca2+ entry in myocardial cells. In isolated cardiac myocytes. usnic acid at 100 μM inhibited the L-type Ca2+ current by 73.0%. In addition. usnic acid caused an irreversible myocardial contracture. reflecting a serious disturbance of the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Such an effect could not be ascribed to tissue death because cell membrane integrity was confirmed by histological observation. Taken together. our results show that usnic acid impairs cardiac function. Clearly more studies will be necessary to allow further applications of this natural product. e59,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:WHBERAHVdrEC,3,https://d-nb.info/1172037272/34,16041453109618454958,/scholar?cites=16041453109618454958,,https://d-nb.info/1172037272/34,0

Several studies showed that important [Na] i  gradients exist close to the cell membrane. Thus. intracellular Na diffusion has to be slow with respect to the rates of Na transport across the sarcolemma. Here we extended the rabbit ventricular action potential and Ca transient model developed in our laboratory to establish [Na] i  gradients that have been inferred directly from experimental data. In our simulations. a dramatic slowing of the Na diffusion coefficient or higher than expected colocalization between Na and Ca transporters is required to predict experimentally derived indirect effects of altered local [Na] i  on Ca handling.

Heart diseases including arrhythmias and heart failure (HF) are major cause of mortality and morbidity for both men and women in the developed world. In the heart. K+ channels are largely responsible for stabilizing the resting membrane potential and repolarization of the action potential (AP).

RyR2 phosphorylation (at Ser2814) by Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is thought to be a critical promoter of leaky RyR2 in HF and arrhythmias. A conformational change in RyR2 (“domain unzipping”) observed in HF can increase SR Ca leak. Calmodulin (CaM) quiets RyR2 gating. and CaM binding affinity for RyR2 is reduced in HF. Here. we tested the hypothesis that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of RyR2 increases Ca leak by favoring the same unzipped-conformation that exhibits reduced CaM-RyR2 binding affinity.

52076,Calcium influx and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling,1987,Donald M Bers,,,,61-68,Springer. Dordrecht,It has now been over 100 years since Ringer [1] demonstrated that extracellular Ca plays a critical role in cardiac muscle contraction. It is now clear that Ca influx is an important factor in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling (ECC). However. whether this Ca influx does in fact contribute directly to the activation of the myofilaments remains controversial. Part of this controversy is quantitative. That is. does enough Ca enter the cell to directly activate the myofilaments during a single cardiac muscle beat? The answer to this. until quite recently would have been. simply. no. Recently. single cell voltage and patch clamp studies [2. 3. 4]. radiotracer flux measurements [5]. and extracellular Ca-selective microelec-trodes and dyes [6. 7] have increased estimates of the Ca influx during a beat (to about 10–183μmol/kg wet tissue) into the range required for half-maximum activation of the myofilaments ([15–42] μmol/kg …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC,2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-3311-8_5,10561709957789257680,/scholar?cites=10561709957789257680,,,0
52077,The role of sarcolemmal-bound Ca2+ in myocardial contractility,1981,KENNETH D Philipson and DONALD M Bers and GLENN A Langer,,The regulation of muscle contraction,,215-223,,Like other muscles. cardiac muscle contracts when the intracellular Ca2+ concentration rises in response to a stimulus. What differs in cardiac muscle is the source of this Ca²+. In skeletal muscle. it is reasonably well-established that it is the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that is responsible for both the release and uptake of contractile-dependent Ca²+. That is. the movements of Ca2+. which control the contractile response in skeletal muscle. are com-pletely intracellular. The corresponding sequence of events in cardiac muscle has not yet been established (for reviews. see (8. 11)]. Evidence. however. from a variety of sources indicates that extracellular Ca2+ has an important role in myocardial excitation contraction (EC) coupling. In contrast to skeletal muscle. the contractile force of cardiac muscle responds rapidly (t 112< 1 min) to any change in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration (1. 18. 24). In addition. the cation lanthanum (La3+) is a potent inhibitor of EC coupling in the myocardium (23). The action of La3+ is on the external surface of the myocardial cell membrane (12) and is presumably to displace Ca2+ from binding sites (23). An example (22) of the different responses of cardiac and skeletal muscle to these interventions is seen in Figure 1. Morphological considerations (9. 13. 16) also implicate external Ca²+ stores as a source of contractile-dependent Ca2+ in the myocardium. The transverse tubules (which are invaginations of the sarcolemma) of cardiac muscle have a diameter (100-400 nm) about 4 times larger than that found in skeletal mus-,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:gYnLYBw1zZMC,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4336266039598993848&hl=en&oi=scholarr,4336266039598993848,/scholar?cites=4336266039598993848,,,0

52088,CaMKII in Cardiac Health and Disease,2014,Eleonora Grandi and Andrew G Edwards and Anthony W Herren and Donald M Bers,,,,,Frontiers E-books,The calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) are a broadly expressed family of calcium-sensitive intracellular kinases. which are responsible for transducing cytosolic calcium signals into phosphorylation-based regulation of proteins and physiological functions. As the multifunctional member of the family. CaMKII has become the most prominent for its roles in the central nervous system and heart. where it controls a diverse range of calcium-dependent processes; from learning and memory at the neuronal synapse. to cellular growth and death in the myocardium. In the heart. CaMKII directly regulates many of the most important ion channels and calcium handling proteins. and controls the expression of an ever-increasing number of transcripts and their downstream products. Functionally. these actions are thought to orchestrate many of the electrophysiologic and contractile adaptations to common cardiac stressors. such as rapid pacing. chronic adrenergic stimulation. and oxidative challenge. In the context of disease. CaMKII has been shown to contribute to a remarkably wide variety of cardiac pathologies. of which heart failure (HF) is the most conspicuous. Hyperactivity of CaMKII is an established contributor to pathological cardiac remodeling. and is widely thought to directly promote arrhythmia and contractile dysfunction during HF. Moreover. several non-failing arrhythmia-susceptible phenotypes. which result from specific genetic channelopathies. functionally mimic constitutive channel phosphorylation by CaMKII.

In isolated pig cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles. we targeted a donor-labeled FKBP (D-FKBP) to the RyR2 cytosolic headpiece. We then detected FRET as a decrease of donor fluorescence in the presence of CaM labeled with acceptor within the N-or C-lobe (denoted A N-CaM and A C-CaM. respectively). thus directly and specifically indexing CaM binding in the proximity of D-FKBP.

52098,The response of cardiac muscle to stretch: calcium and force,2011,John Jeremy Rice and Donald M Bers,,Cardiac Mechano-Electric Coupling and Arrhythmias,,74,OUP Oxford,BackgroundMammalian muscle is characterized by a biphasic force response to stretch. In isolated myocardium. stretch induces an immediate increase in twitch force [immediate force response (IFR)]. followed by a slowly developing second phase [slow force response (SFR)] as first described by Parmley and Chuck (1). The IFR is the result of a length-dependent increase in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac muscle. Whereas the acute increase in Ca2+ sensitivity is well characterized and generally accepted as the cellular basis of the Frank–Starling mechanism. the underlying mechanisms of the length dependence remain controversial. After the immediate increase in force. SFR is characterized by a gradual increase in force that saturates over a time course of minutes. This increase is probably involved in the classic Anrep effect (afterload-induced increase in myocardial contractility. described first by Russian Physiologist Gleb Anrep in J Physiol in 1912). because it is assumed to correspond to the secondary increase in developed pressure found in whole heart. The increase in force is paralleled by an increase in the Ca2+ transient amplitude (2). but the source of the increase is still under debate. Several mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to the SFR. including changes in direct or indirect trans-membrane Ca2+ influx via stretch-activated channels (SAC) or second messenger systems. These mechanisms are reviewed in this chapter.,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:Hck25ST_3aIC,1,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=AgoBCHptrFYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA74&dq=info:ZZXHcyoJi9UJ:scholar.google.com&ots=xCr5jQZa3Z&sig=2q8DpgRllM1wGxAAeS2Uvl0o2cU,15387402629777167717,/scholar?cites=15387402629777167717,,,0

52130,Inotropic mechanisms in cardiac muscle,2001,DONALD M BERS,,,,779-788,Academic Press,The major ways to alter the inotropic state in the heart are to modulate the cellular Ca transient or alter how the myofilaments respond to the Ca transient. Thus. it is useful to start the discussion by reviewing the basic Ca fluxes that occur during the cardiac contraction–relaxation cycle (see Fig. 1; Bers. 1991). During the cardiac action potential (AP). L-type Ca channels are activated and Ca entering the cell via the Ca current (I Ca) can trigger Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and. to a certain extent. can contribute to activation of the myofilaments directly (more on this later). Ca can also enter the cell via Na/Ca exchange during the action potential. but under normal physiological conditions the amount of Ca entering via this pathway is very small compared to the amount entering via I Ca. Ca entry plus the amount released by the SR via Ca-induced Ca release (CICR) raises cytosolic [Ca]([Ca] i) and. as …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:An6A6Jpfc1oC,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10486084825964093391&hl=en&oi=scholarr,10486084825964093391,/scholar?cites=10486084825964093391,,,0

""Backflux"" through the SR calcium pump is a critical feature which allows realistically small values for SR calcium leak fluxes to be used. Total cytosolic calcium was calculated from the latter part of (Ca)i decline using rate constants for cellular calcium buffers. Intra-SR calcium buffering characteristics were also deduced. We found that the net SR calcium pump flux and rate of (Ca)i decline decreased as the SR free (Ca) rose. with pump parameters held constant. We have therefore characterized for the first time in intact myocytes both forward and reverse SR calcium pump kinetics as well as intra-SR calcium buffering and SR calcium leak.

NY Acad. Sci,,350-352,,1). Ca transport is often described by the classic Hill equation plus a non-pumpmediated leak flux (eg. via the SR Ca release channel). For a SR Ca pump Km of 0.2-0.6uM Ca. the resting Ca leak flux at steady state would be quite large (~ 1/5 of the Vmax of the pump). However. Bassani and Bers measured a steady state unidirectional Ca leak flux in isolated intact myocytes that was about 100 times smaller.'We hypothesize that accumulated intra-SR free [Ca]([Ca] SR) limits both total SR [Ca] and (Ca). decline at rest by causing a flux of Ca from the SR to the cytosol medi-ated by the SR Ca pump (Fig. 1). Such a reverse flux through the pump has been demonstrated in SR membrane vesicles. 2. 3. 5. 6 We term this transport from the SR backflux.

52157,Citrate decreases Ca current and changes selectivity of cardiac Ca channels,1992,Larry V Hryshko and Donald M Bers,,,,413-415,Springer. Boston. MA,Previous studies using citrate as a low affinity Ca buffer have shown that this agent inhibits myocardial contractions1–3 and neurotransmitter release4. Using several different low affinity Ca buffers we have demonstrated that these effects are unlikely to be attributable to Ca buffering per se 3. Here we demonstrate that citrate can directly inhibit Ca current (ICa). The decrease in ICa appears to be due to shifts in channel gating (due to surface charge effects) and also to a decrease in channel selectivity for Ca over monovalent ions.,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:ce2CqMG-AY4C,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-3362-7_60,3539150865681082763,/scholar?cites=3539150865681082763,,,0

Donald M. Bers and i) avid M. Christensen. Division of Biomedical Sciences. University of California. Riverside. California. 92521-0121 USA We use rapid cooling contractures(RCCs) as an index of SR Ca content. Rapid cooling to 1 C induces a loss of SR Ca to the myoplasm. activating the myofilaments and an RCC. Rapid rewarming while tension and presumably[Cali are high results in a transient increase in force (due to an increase in myofilament Ca sensitivity). This is followed by relaxation due to reactivation of ion pumps which had been inhibited by the cold. This relaxation can be slowed slightly by either adding caffeine(10 mM) to or removing Na (and Ca) from the cold and rewarming solutions.

52166,Postrest inotropy in rabbit ventricle,1986,JL Sutko and Donald M Bers and JP Reeves,250,American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology,4,,,To determine whether Na+-Ca 2+ exchange is a physiologically significant Ca 2+ efflux mechanism in rabbit ventricle. we investigated the effects exerted on postrest contractions by interventions that alter the transmembrane distribution of Na+ or Ca 2+ so as to retard Ca 2+ efflux via this system. Contractions elicited after rest periods of 0.25-10 min in duration were studied. The following interventions increased postrest contractions much more than those elicited by rhythmic stimulation: 1) Na+ pump inhibition by cardiac glycosides or by a reduction in extracellular K+. 2) reduction of extracellular Na+(maintaining a constant [Ca 2+]-to-[Na+] 2 ratio). and 3) elevation of extracellular Ca 2+. In contrast. isoproterenol. norepinephrine. and histamine produced comparable increases in both rhythmically stimulated and postrest contractions. suggesting that the postrest contractile potentiation was not just the result of a …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:cTy_cm4PQvYC,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13930571297222351584&hl=en&oi=scholarr,13930571297222351584,/scholar?cites=13930571297222351584,,,0

We compare personalised rating with the more widely used objective rating where. instead. customers receive an aggregate evaluation of what everybody else has declared so far. We focus on the manipulability of such systems. allowing a malicious service provider (eg. the restaurant owner) to transfer monetary incentive to the individuals in order to manipulate their rating and increase the overall profit.

Chronic CaMKII over-activation due to autophosphorylation at the well-known T287 site can prolong CaMKII activity in an open “autonomous” conformational state. which persists partially even after Ca/CaM dissociates. This prolonged “memory” effect is implicated in several cardiac pathologies such as heart failure and arrhythmias. Recently. we and others have discovered four post-translational modifications (PTMs)(oxidation at MM281/282. O-GlcNAcylation at S280. and S-nitrosylation at C273 and C290) that also regulate and may prolong CaMKII activity.

One possible reason is in the fact that our knowledge is mostly based on experimental animal models (eg. mouse and rabbit) characterized by quite different cellular electrophysiology. Indeed. we have shown that well conserved mammalian responses to β-AR stimulation (fight or flight) are mediated by different sub-cellular processes in mouse vs. rabbit.

Its persistent over-activation has been implicated in arrhythmias. heart failure. and other diseases. Typically. CaMKII activates upon Ca-CaM binding during elevated [Ca] free and inactivates upon Ca-CaM dissociation when [Ca] free drops. Several post-translational-modifications (PTMs) also trap CaMKII in an autonomously activated state even after [Ca] i declines. The PTMs include autophosphorylation. oxidation. S-nitrosylation. and O-GlcNAcylation. Exactly how these PTMs regulate CaM binding to CaMKIIδ-the predominant cardiac isoform-is unknown. Schulman's group showed that autophosphorylation of CaMKIIα (neuronal isoform) increases its CaM affinity by∼ 1.000-fold in lysates. CaMKII activity that persists during low [Ca] free creates a form of molecular memory.

However. inter-species differences in the mechanisms regulating excitation-contraction coupling can limit the translation of experimental findings from animal models to human physiology. and undermine the assessment of drugs9 efficacy and safety. Here. we built a suite of translators for quantitatively mapping electrophysiological responses in ventricular myocytes across species. We trained these statistical operators using a broad dataset obtained by simulating populations of our biophysically detailed computational models of action potential and Ca2+ transient in mouse. rabbit. and human. We then tested our translators against experimental data describing the response to stimuli. such as ion channel block. change in beating rate. and β-adrenergic challenge.

Chronic CaMKII activation in autonomous states can occur in DM and contribute to arrhythmogenesis. Diabetic hyperglycemia has been shown to activate CaMKII by (1) O-linked attachment of N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) at S280 leading to arrhythmia and (2) a ROS-CaMKII pathway. and these can increase post-infarction mortality. However. the mechanism by which high extracellular [glucose] (Hi-Glu) promotes ROS generation that may synergize with CaMKII activation remains unknown. Here we tested the mechanism by which extracellular Hi-Glu influences ROS production in adult ventricular myocytes. using H2DCFDA to measure ROS.

Increased Na þ loading limits the ability of the Na þ/Ca2þ exchanger to remove Ca2þ. which along with the reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2þ uptake and increased diastolic SR Ca2þ leak leads to Ca2þ overload. thus contributing to diastolic dysfunction and triggered arrhythmias (ie. via delayed afterdepolarizations).

52211,Calcium Signaling Series,2017,Donald M Bers,,Circulation Research,,,,Calcium (Ca2+) is a universal regulator of various cellular functions. In cardiomyocytes. Ca2+ is the central element of excitation–contraction coupling. but also impacts diverse signaling cascades and influences the regulation of gene expression. referred to as excitation–transcription coupling. Disturbances in cellular Ca2+-handling and alterations in Ca2+-dependent gene expression patterns are pivotal characteristics of failing cardiomyocytes. with several excitation–transcription coupling pathways shown to be critically involved in structural and functional remodeling processes. Thus. targeting Ca2+-dependent transcriptional pathways might offer broad therapeutic potential. In this article. we (1) review cytosolic and nuclear Ca2+ dynamics in cardiomyocytes with respect to their impact on Ca2+-dependent signaling.(2) give an overview on Ca2+-dependent transcriptional pathways in cardiomyocytes. and (3) discuss implications of excitation–transcription coupling in the diseased heart.(Circ Res. 2017; 121: 1000-1020.

Normal function requires that [Ca2+](i) be sufficiently high in systole and low in diastole. Much of the Ca needed for contraction comes from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and is released by the process of calcium-induced calcium release. The factors that regulate and fine-tune the initiation and termination of release are reviewed. The precise control of intracellular Ca cycling depends on the relationships between the various channels and pumps that are involved. We consider 2 aspects: (1) structural coupling: the transporters are organized within the dyad. linking the transverse tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum and ensuring close proximity of Ca entry to sites of release.

Parv gene delivery to the heart has been studied as a therapeutic strategy for diastolic heart failure. in which slow Ca 2+ reuptake is an important contributor. A limitation of WT-Parv in this context is the significant trade-off between faster relaxation rate and blunting of contraction amplitude. which occurs because WT-Parv sequesters Ca 2+ too early in the cardiac cycle and prematurely truncates sarcomere shortening in the facilitation of rapid relaxation. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that an E→ Q substitution (ParvE101Q) at amino acid 12 of the EF-hand metal-ion binding loop increases Mg 2+ affinity and decreases Ca 2+ affinity.

Increasing mechanical load causes enhanced contractility and elevated systolic Ca 2+ transient that is mediated by nitric oxide synthase (NOS).

The intracellular sodium concentration ([Na] i) is critical in regulating both intracellular calcium (Ca) homeostasis and membrane voltage (V). However. the role of [Na] i in the formation of early afterdepolarizations (EADs) is not completely understood. In this study. we applied mathematical modeling to show that slow [Na] i accumulation can lead to a novel form of aperiodic voltage dynamics where a sequence of action potentials (APs) with EADs occurs intermittently during regular periodic pacing. We find that these trains of EADs occur quasi-periodically and lead to intermittent EAD propagation and arrhythmias.

Inc. Rationale: The Na+/K+ ATPase directly regulates intracellular Na+ levels. which in turn indirectly regulates Ca2+ levels by proximally controlling flux through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Elevated Na+ levels have been reported during heart failure. which permits some degree of reverse-mode Ca2+ entry through NCX1. as well as less efficient Ca2+ clearance. Objective: To determine whether maintaining lower intracellular Na+ levels by NKA overexpression in the heart would enhance forward-mode Ca2+ clearance and prevent reverse-mode Ca2+ entry through NCX1 to protect the heart. Methods and Results: Cardiac-specific transgenic mice overexpressing either NKA-α1 or NKA-α2 were generated and subjected to pressure overload hypertrophic stimulation. We found that although increased expression of NKA-α1 had no protective effect. overexpression of NKA-α2 significantly decreased cardiac hypertrophy after pressure overload in mice at 2. 10. and 16 weeks of stimulation. Remarkably. total NKA protein expression and activity were not altered in either of these 2 transgenic models because increased expression of one isoform led to a concomitant decrease in the other endogenous isoform. NKA-α2 overexpression but not NKA-α1 led to significantly faster removal of bulk Ca2+ from the cytosol in a manner requiring NCX1 activity. Mechanistically. overexpressed NKA-α2 showed greater affinity for Na+ compared with NKA-α1. leading to more efficient clearance of this ion. Furthermore. overexpression of NKA-α2 but not NKA-α1 was coupled to a decrease in phospholemman expression and …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:4pF9x-cDGsoC,0,https://philpapers.org/rec/COROOT-2,,,,,0

Such changes in extracellular [K+] and [Ca2+] were ﬁrst described in neural tissue by Lux and Neher (1) and by Heinemann et al.(2). but in the present chapter we will focus on our experience in using extracellu-lar Ca2+-selective microelectrodes in cardiac muscle (3—8).,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:adHtZc2wMuEC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=v7AaAwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA278&dq=info:KTzoDjnfEYcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=SPFokszKVw&sig=B0EadzjQm1oEfJEH7BLeURgXCUo,,,,,0

Linescan images have been used to obtain detailed information about intracellular calcium concentration disregarding the mechanical activity of the cell. In order to fill this gap we have designed an algorithm to recover the cell length information from those images. We implemented this program using LabVIEW language.

Treatment with cardiac glycosides such as digitalis increases cardiac contractility by elevating intracellular calcium through inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA). However. the therapeutic window for this class of drugs is narrow as high calcium levels lead to increased SR load. calcium leak. and cardiac arrhythmias. Alternatively. the endogenous inhibitor of NKA. phospholemman (PLM). is dynamically regulated. We hypothesize that a superinhibitory mutant of PLM will increase the contractility of cardiac myocytes. This effect will be inherently self-limiting since inhibition of NKA is relieved by phosphorylation or elevated intracellular sodium. Here we used a high-throughput screen of PLM mutants utilizing fluorescence microscopy to simultaneously measure PLM-NKA and PLM-PLM …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:LGlY6t8CeOMC,0,https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(12)02114-5.pdf,,,,https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(12)02114-5.pdf,0

52278,Post-translational Modifications of the Cardiac Na Channel,2013,Anthony W Herren and Donald M Bers and Eleonora Grandi,,,,,,NaV1. 5 is the pore forming α-subunit of the voltage-gated cardiac Na channel. which is 22 responsible for the initiation and propagation of cardiac action potentials.

The scaffolding protein AKAP150 is a key regulator of calcineurin (CaN). a phosphatase known to modulate expression of the regulatory BKCa β1 subunit. Whether AKAP150 mediates BKCa channel suppression during hyperglycemia and diabetes is unknown.Objective: To test the hypothesis that AKAP150-dependent CaN signaling mediates BKCa β1 downregulation and impaired vascular BKCa channel function during hyperglycemia and diabetes.Methods and Results: We found that AKAP150 is an important determinant of BKCa channel remodeling. CaN/NFATc3 activation. and resistance artery constriction in hyperglycemic animals on high fat diet (HFD). Genetic ablation of AKAP150 protected against these alterations. including augmented vasoconstriction. D-glucose-dependent suppression of BKCa channel β1 subunits required Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels and mobilization of a CaN/NFATc3 signaling pathway. Remarkably. HFD mice expressing a mutant AKAP150 unable to anchor CaN resisted activation of NFATc3 and downregulation of BKCa β1 subunits. and attenuated HFD-induced elevation in arterial blood pressure.Conclusions: Our results support a model whereby subcellular anchoring of CaN by AKAP150 is a key molecular determinant of vascular BKCa channel remodeling. which contributes to vasoconstriction during diabetes.,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:CMvovTBb2okC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/43030220/AKAP150_Contributes_to_Enhanced_Vascular20160224-26002-1sapynr.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43030220/AKAP150_Contributes_to_Enhanced_Vascular20160224-26002-1sapynr.pdf,0
52281,Commentaries on Cutting Edge Science,2013,Benoit G Bruneau and Deepak Srivastava,498,Nature,,220-223,,An intriguing question is why the mutations identified in this study cause cardiac-specific defects. The genes pinpointed function in all cell types and broadly regulate gene expression from the earliest stages of development and throughout adulthood. Indeed. somatic mutations in some of the same genes are considered to be causative forces for many cancers. MLL2 mutations were previously found to be associated with a syndrome (Kabuki syndrome) that included CHD. 11 among a constellation of other defects. and on re-evaluation of the patient with MLL2 mutations. Zaidi et al6 indeed found features that correspond with some of the notable facial features of Kabuki syndrome. On the contrary. the patient bearing the CHD7 mutation had no other features typical of CHARGE association. previously known to be caused by mutations in CHD7. The authors conclude by suggesting that environmental perturbation might modulate the expressivity of CHD-associated mutations or could even modulate the pathways that they regulate. Identifying the specific genomic targets of the chromatin remodeling factors and the effect that the CHD-associated mutations have on the epigenomic status of these target loci will be required to establish what pathways they regulate and to assess the degree to which these might be disrupted in the setting of disease. Although this study represents an important step forward in the study of CHD. many questions remain. For example. sequencing limited to the exome precluded the investigation of noncoding regulatory elements that are the key modulators of gene expression.

Most RyRs are organized into clusters within narrow dyadic junctions between sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes. It is still unclear how junctions are formed and maintained. One protein that has been implicated in dyadic junction formation is the cardiac isoform of the junctophilin family. junctophilin-2 (JPH2). With the increased resolution available in multi-color super-resolution microscopy it is now possible to investigate the nanoscale relationship between proteins such as RyRs and JPH2 which are found within the junction.

At the resting membrane potential (V m∼-80 mV). the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) removes Ca from the cell (forward mode). If Ca released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is quickly removed via forward mode NCX before the positive feedback process starts. the Ca release becomes non-spark Ca leak. However. at higher V m. Ca enters through the NCX (reverse mode) and Ca entry through reverse mode NCX may activate ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and initiate Ca sparks.

Our experimental strategy is to use isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to monitor the binding of SH3 to engineered SosY peptides. enabling the direct detection of ligand population that is in the PII conformation. Importantly. our model system allows direct access to free energy information concerning the context dependent PII propensity of amino acids at specific sites in the SosY peptide.

The Na þ/K þ-ATPase. a membrane-associated ion-motive ATPase. uses energy from the hydrolysis of ATP to move Na þ out of and K þ into cells. We have labeled ATPase isolated from duck supraorbital salt glands with Cy3-maleimide (Cy3-ATPase). We have previously found that the fluorescence of Cy3-ATPase decreases in the presence of ATP (Biochim Biophys Acta 2009; 1794: 1549-1557). We found there that the kinetics of this ATP decrease exhibited negative cooperativity. To determine whether this behavior is due either to interaction between protomers or is an intrinsic property of monomers. we examined the fluorescence of the labeled enzyme solubilized in the nonionic detergent C12E8 in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of ATP using …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:jtI9f0ekYq0C,0,https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(10)04229-3.pdf,,,,https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(10)04229-3.pdf,0
52315,How Does RyR2-Mediated SR Calcium Leak Fail to Cause Sparks?,2011,Daisuke Sato and Donald M Bers,100,Biophysical Journal,3,557a-558a,Elsevier,Wednesday. March 9. 2011 557a find that several factors contribute to the failure of one RyR channel opening to opens adjacent RyRs as [Ca] SR declines: 1) the lower [Ca] SR reduces driving force and thus limits local [Ca] Cleft (both absolute level and rate of rise). 2) low [Ca] SR can inhibit RyR open time (tO) which further reduces local [Ca] Cleft attained. 3) the low tO and fast [Ca] Cleft dissipation after closure shorten the opportunity for neighboring RyR activation. 4) at low [Ca] SR the RyR2 exhibits reduced [Ca] Cleft sensitivity. We conclude that all of these factors conspire to reduce the probability of Ca sparks as [Ca] SR declines. despite continued RyR-mediated SR Ca leak.,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:t-hv7AR41mYC,0,https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(10)04744-2.pdf,,,,https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(10)04744-2.pdf,0

52317,Location Matters,2011,Shikha Mishra and Charles BB Gray and Shigeki Miyamoto and Donald M Bers and Joan Heller Brown,,,,,,Objective: To determine whether CaMKII subtypes are restricted to a particular subcellular location and assess the relationship of localization to enzyme activation and function.Methods and Results: CaMKII is highly expressed in mouse heart and cardiomyocytes and concentrated in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)/membrane and nuclear fractions. CaMKII B and C subtypes differ by a nuclear localization sequence. but both are present in nuclear and SR/membrane fractions. Nonselective subtype distribution is also seen in mice overexpressing CaMKII B or C. even in a CaMKII null background. Fluorescently tagged CaMKII B expressed in cardiomyocytes concentrates in nuclei whereas C concentrates in cytosol. but neither localization is exclusive. Mouse hearts exposed to phenylephrine show selective CaMKII activation in the nuclear (versus SR) compartment. whereas caffeine selectively activates CaMKII in SR (versus nuclei). independent of subtype. Compartmentalized activation extends to functional differences in target phosphorylation at CaMKII sites: phenylephrine increases histone deacetylase 5 phosphorylation (Ser498) but not phospholamban (Thr17). whereas the converse holds for caffeine.Conclusions: These studies demonstrate that CaMKII B and C are not exclusively restricted to the nucleus and cytosol and that spatial and functional specificity in CaMKII activation is elicited by mobilization of different Ca2 stores rather than by compartmentalized subtype localization.(Circ Res. 2011; 109: 1354-1362.),True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:Np1obAXpBq8C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13577770311272664878&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

We extended the LTCC model to assess whether and how experimental I Ba  inactivation could be recapitulated by modifying CDL Simulation results show that I Ba  inactivation measured in rabbit myocytes at physiological temperature can be recapitulated when making the Ca-dependent transition rates 10-fold less sensitive to Ba vs. Ca.

However. ET-1 requires IP3 receptor (IP3R) activation (at the nucleus) and CaM-CaMKII activation to mediate this full effect. while PE does not. That is. IP3R inhibition or CaMKII block do not prevent PE-induced HDAC5 nuclear export. despite the fact that both agonists can activate IP3 production. Here we test whether the apparent IP3-independence of PE signaling is due to a failure of IP3 elevation in the nucleus (ie IP3 produced at the plasma membrane may be degraded before reaching the nucleus). Using a nuclear targeted FRET-based IP3 sensor (Fire-1-Nuc) we assessed changes in nuclear [IP3] upon ET-1 and PE application in adult rabbit ventricular myocytes.

Canberra City. Australia. 2JCSMR. Canberra. Australia. The beta1a subunit of the skeletal muscle DHPR plays two important roles in excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscle. Beta1a was originally found to target the alpha1S subunit of the DHPR to sarcolemmal tetrads which oppose skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR1) channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It was later found to also aid in transmission of EC coupling between the alpha1S subunit and RyR1 (1. 2. 3). through its C-terminal tail residues (1. 2). This presumably depends on an interaction between the C-terminal tail of beta1a and RyR1. The full beta1a subunit binds to RyR1 in affinity chromatography experiments (4). but direct binding of the C-tail to RyR1 has not been reported. nor have direct functional interactions between the proteins.

In the present report. we provide evidence that dendritic cells also express the Cav1. 2 subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel and that release of intracellular Ca2+ via RyR1 depends on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and is sensitive to ryanodine and nifedipine. Interestingly. RyR1 activation causes a very rapid increase in expression of MHC II molecules on the surface of dendritic cells. an effect which is also observed upon incubation of mouse BM12 dendritic cells with transgenic T cells whose T cell receptor is specific for the I-Abm12 protein.

Hashambhoy. Raimond L. Winslow. Joseph L. Greenstein. Johns Hopkins University. Baltimore. MD. USA. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays an important role in L-type Ca2+ channel (LCC) facilitation. the Ca2+-dependent augmentation of Ca2+ current (ICaL) that manifests itself during rapid repeated depolarizing stimuli. Multiple mechanisms may underlie facilitation. including increased LCC rate of recovery from Ca2+ Àdependent inactivation. and a shift in distribution of LCCs into high activity mode 2 gating. characterized by prolonged channel openings.

This happens when the channel moves into the open state. but most of the time. as revealed by the low open probability values. the channel transitions between closed or inactive states.

To have a better representation of the total behavior of the channel we constructed a computer program (MarkoLAB) that creates a 3-D plot with all channel's states. In this graphical interface each state is represented with a column. The height of the column is proportional to the occupancy level.

To better understand how CASQ2 mutants cause CPVT. we expressed two CPVT-linked CASQ2 mutants. a truncated protein (at G112+ 5X. CASQ2DEL) or CASQ2 containing a point mutation (CASQ2R33Q). in canine ventricular myocytes and assessed their effects on Ca handling. We also measured CASQ2-CASQ2 variant interactions using fluorescence resonance transfer (FRET) in a heterologous expression system. and evaluated CASQ2 interaction with triadin. We found that expression of CASQ2DEL or CASQ2R33Q altered myocyte Ca signaling through two different mechanisms. Overexpressing CASQ2DEL disrupted the CASQ2 polymerization required for high capacity Ca binding. while CASQ2R33Q compromised the ability of CASQ2 to control ryanodine receptor (RyR2) channel activity. Despite profound differences in SR Ca buffering strengths. local Ca release terminated at the same free luminal [Ca] in control cells. cells overexpressing wild type CASQ2 and CASQ2DEL–expressing myocytes. suggesting that a decline in [Ca] SR is a signal for RyR2 closure. Importantly. disrupting interactions between the RyR2 channel and CASQ2 by expressing CASQ2R33Q markedly lowered the [Ca] SR threshold for Ca release termination. We conclude that CASQ2 in the SR determines the magnitude and duration of Ca release from each SR terminal by providing both a local source of releasable Ca and by effects on luminal Ca …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:PuOEWVtPfzwC,0,http://www.nitanbiotech.com/pdf/Biophys_JBioFAST.pdf,,,,http://www.nitanbiotech.com/pdf/Biophys_JBioFAST.pdf,0
52346,UltraRapid Communication,2008,Aleksey V Zima and Eckard Picht and Donald M Bers and Lothar A Blatter,,,,,,Ca2 release from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via ryanodine receptors (RyRs) is regulated by dyadic cleft [Ca2] and intra-SR free [Ca2]([Ca2] SR). Robust SR Ca2 release termination is important for stable excitation–contraction coupling. and partial [Ca2] SR depletion may contribute to release termination. Here. we investigated the regulation of SR Ca2 release termination of spontaneous local SR Ca2 release events (Ca2 sparks) by [Ca2] SR. release flux. and intra-SR Ca2 diffusion. We simultaneously measured Ca2 sparks and Ca2 blinks (localized elementary [Ca2] SR depletions) in permeabilized ventricular cardiomyocytes over a wide range of SR Ca2 loads and release fluxes. Sparks terminated via a [Ca2] SR-dependent mechanism at a fixed [Ca2] SR depletion threshold independent of the initial [Ca2] SR and release flux. Ca2 blink recovery depended mainly on intra-SR Ca2 diffusion rather than SR Ca2 uptake. Therefore. the large variation in Ca2 blink recovery rates at different release sites occurred because of differences in the degree of release site interconnection within the SR network. When SR release flux was greatly reduced. long-lasting release events occurred from well-connected junctions. These junctions could sustain release because local SR Ca2 release and [Ca2] SR refilling reached a balance. preventing [Ca2] SR from depleting to the termination threshold. Prolonged release events eventually terminated at a steady [Ca2] SR. indicative of a slower.[Ca2] SR-independent termination mechanism.

Although depressed pump function is common. development of effective therapies to stimulate contraction has proven difficult. This is thought to be attributable to their frequent reliance on cAMP stimulation to increase activator Ca2+. A potential alternative is nitroxyl (HNO). the 1-electron reduction product of nitric oxide (NO) that improves contraction and relaxation in normal and failing hearts in vivo. The mechanism for myocyte effects remains unknown. Here. we show that this activity results from a direct interaction of HNO with the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump and the ryanodine receptor 2. leading to increased Ca2+ uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. HNO increases the open probability of isolated ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+-release channels and accelerates Ca2+ reuptake into isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum by stimulating ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport. Contraction improves with no net rise in diastolic calcium. These changes are not induced by NO. are fully reversible by addition of reducing agents (redox sensitive). and independent of both cAMP/protein kinase A and cGMP/protein kinase G signaling. Rather. the data support HNO/thiolate interactions that enhance the activity of intracellular Ca2+ cycling proteins.

However. it is not known whether Hsp20 exerts its protective action through calcium handling or chaperone activity. The C-terminal extensions of some small heat shock proteins. such as alphaB-crystallin and Hsp25. are implicated in chaperoning activity.

We hypothesized that nuclear and cytoplasmic CaMKIIδ isoforms regulate separate signaling pathways. with δB involved in nuclear transcriptional regulation and δC in cytosolic Ca handling. Surprisingly we found that either CaMKIIδB or δC could activate MEF2-luciferase gene expression in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). To determine whether this occurred in vivo. CaMKIIδB or δC transgenic (TG) mice were crossed with MEF2/3-galactosidase indicator mice. Increased MEF2 activation. assessed by β-gal activity. was elicited by both CaMKII isoforms.

52367,Phospholamban Ablation Rescues SR Ca2+ Loading But Not Cardiac Function In CaMKIIλC Transgenic Mice,2006,Shikha Mishra and Tong Zhang and Tao Guo and Donald Bers and Joan Heller Brown,20,,5,A1124-A1124,Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,Ca2+/calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is a key candidate for controlling phosphorylation and function of Ca2+ regulatory proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). including the ryanodine receptors (RyR2) and phospholamban (PLB). The predominant form of CaMKII in the heart is the λ isoform. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing CaMKIIλC in the heart develop dilated cardiomyopathy due to increased phosphorylation of the RyR2 and enhanced SR Ca2+ leak. The associated lowering of SR Ca2+ load likely contributes to decreased ventricular contractility. Since PLB limits SR Ca2+ uptake. we hypothesized that PLB ablation would recover SR Ca2+ load and rescue the heart failure phenotype. Accordingly. we crossed PLB −/ − mice with CaMKIIλ TG and found surprisingly. that the phenotype was exaggerated in the double mutant (DM) mice.

52368,Na and Ca Regulation in Normal and Failing Hearts,2006,Donald M Bers,,第十五届国际药理学大会论文集,,,,正 Ca in cardiac myocytes regulates contractility and electrophysiology. Ca and Na regulation are linked via Na/Ca exchange (NCX). and Na/K-ATPase (NKA) is the main means of Na extrusion. Heart failure (HF) exhibits contractile dysfunction and arrhythmias. and both are due to altered Ca Na handling. Triggered arrhythmias (eg DADs) are prominent in HF. DADs are due to spontaneous SR Ca release and activation of transient inward NCX current. Thus NCX and Na are critical in systolic diastolic function and arrhythmias.[Na] i is elevated in HF which may limit SR unloading and provide Ca influx during the HF action potential. thus limiting depressed systolic function. High [Na] i in HF is due to enhanced Na influx. Cellular NKA function appears unaltered. despite reduced NKA expression. We find that phospholemman (PLM) regulates NKA by an inhibition which is relieved by PLM phosphorylation. Intermolecular FRET between PLM and NKA is substantial and is reduced upon PLM phosphorylation. The lower expression level of more phosphory-lated PLM in HF may explain unaltered NKA function with lower expression. Thus. altered Ca and Na handling are important in contractile function and arrhythmogenesis in HF.,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:c1AJUTjuCtUC,0,https://cpfd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CPFDTOTAL-ZGYS200607001116.htm,,,,,0

This chapter focuses on how certain RyR modulators affect release and excitation-contraction coupling in intact ventricular myocytes. where the RyR complex in the sarcoplasmic reticulum associates closely with sarcolemmal channels. We consider the effects of protein kinase A. dependent protein kinase. and protein phosphatases on RyR function in intact ventricular myocytes. There are multiple inherent feedback systems and parallel pathways which can complicate the effects of these and other RyR modulators. integrating into a cellular response.

While myocytes models with limited numbers of intracellular compartments can sometimes be adjusted to reflect the appropriate whole Ca transients. mechanistic insights about local control will be aided by models. which incorporate stochastic behavior of either individual RyRs or at least individual junctions.

Md.: Grune & Stratton. c1953-,Free (Ca2+) inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum ((Ca2+)SR) is difficult to measure yet critically important in controlling many cellular systems. In cardiac myocytes. (Ca2+)SR regulates cardiac contractility. We directly measure (Ca2+)SR in intact cardiac myocytes dynamically and quantitatively during beats. with high spatial resolution. Diastolic (Ca2+)SR (1 to 1.5 mmol/L) is only partially depleted (24% to 63%) during contraction. There is little temporal delay in the decline in (Ca2+)SR at release junctions and between junctions. indicating rapid internal diffusion. The incomplete local Ca2+ release shows that the inherently positive feedback of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release terminates. despite a large residual driving force. These findings place stringent novel constraints on how excitation-contraction coupling works in heart and also reveal a Ca2+ store reserve that could in principle be a therapeutic target to enhance …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:S_fw-_riRmcC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4875836248431157775&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

52431,Arrhythmogenesis and Contractile Dysfunction in Heart Failure,2001,Residual-Adrenergic Responsiveness,,,,,,Ventricular arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction are the main causes of death in human heart failure (HF). In a rabbit HF model reproducing these same aspects of human HF. we demonstrate that a 2-fold functional upregulation of Na-Ca2 exchange (NaCaX) unloads sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2 stores. reducing Ca2 transients and contractile function. Whereas ß-adrenergic receptors (ß-ARs) are progressively downregulated in HF. residual ß-AR responsiveness at this critical HF stage allows SR Ca2 load to increase. causing spontaneous SR Ca2 release and transient inward current carried by NaCaX. A given Ca2 release produces greater arrhythmogenic inward current in HF (as a result of NaCaX upregulation). and 50% less Ca2 release is required to trigger an action potential in HF. The inward rectifier potassium current (IK1) is reduced by 49% in HF. and this allows greater depolarization for a given NaCaX current. Partially blocking IK1 in control cells with barium mimics the greater depolarization for a given current injection seen in HF. Thus. we present data to support a novel paradigm in which changes in NaCaX and IK1. and residual ß-AR responsiveness. conspire to greatly increase the propensity for triggered arrhythmias in HF. In addition. NaCaX upregulation appears to be a critical link between contractile dysfunction and arrhythmogenesis.(Circ Res. 2001; 88:,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:J-ba04ztB30C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald_Bers/publication/237281491_Arrhythmogenesis_and_Contractile_Dysfunction_in_Heart_Failure_Roles_of_Sodium-Calcium_Exchange_Inward_Rectifier_Potassium_Current_and_Residual_-Adrenergic_Responsiveness/links/5b009ec74585154aeb052aaa/Arrhythmogenesis-and-Contractile-Dysfunction-in-Heart-Failure-Roles-of-Sodium-Calcium-Exchange-Inward-Rectifier-Potassium-Current-and-Residual-Adrenergic-Responsiveness.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald_Bers/publication/237281491_Arrhythmogenesis_and_Contractile_Dysfunction_in_Heart_Failure_Roles_of_Sodium-Calcium_Exchange_Inward_Rectifier_Potassium_Current_and_Residual_-Adrenergic_Responsiveness/links/5b009ec74585154aeb052aaa/Arrhythmogenesis-and-Contractile-Dysfunction-in-Heart-Failure-Roles-of-Sodium-Calcium-Exchange-Inward-Rectifier-Potassium-Current-and-Residual-Adrenergic-Responsiveness.pdf,0

Md.: Grune & Stratton. c1953-,Disturbed sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content may underlie the altered force-frequency and postrest contractile behavior in failing human myocardium. We used rapid cooling contractures (RCCs) to assess SR Ca2+ content in ventricular muscle strips isolated from nonfailing and end-stage failing human hearts. With an increase in rest intervals (1 to 240 s; 37degreeC). nonfailing human myocardium (n=7) exhibited a parallel increase in postrest twitch force (at 240 s by 121+-44%; P<0.05) and RCC amplitude (by 69+-53%; P<0.05). In contrast. in failing myocardium (n=30). postrest twitch force decreased at long rest intervals and RCC amplitude declined monotonically with rest (by 25+-9% and 53+-9%. respectively; P<0.05). With an increase in stimulation frequencies (0.25 to 3 Hz). twitch force increased continuously in nonfailing human myocardium (n=7) by 71+-17% (at 3 Hz; P<0.05) and RCC amplitude …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:pYRxIbzCxX0C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12537538281561640220&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0
52452,SparkMaster: automated calcium spark analysis with,1999,Eckard Picht and Aleksey V Zima and Lothar A Blatter and Donald M Bers,606,image,,617,,METHODSSpark analysis algorithm and ImageJ implementation. The spark detection algorithm is derived from the threshold-based algorithm described by Cheng et al.(4) with some modifications. This algorithm was implemented as a Java plug-in into the freely available imageprocessing software ImageJ. Care was taken to ensure that the results of the ImageJ plug-in would yield the same results as the original IDL macro. A thorough description of the algorithm is provided by Song et al.(17) and by Cheng et al.(4). In short. the algorithm identifies Ca sparks based on their deviation from the background noise. After the image has been low-pass filtered with the use of a 5 5-pixel median filter and a 4 4-pixel smoothing filter. it is normalized on a column-by-column basis (ie. for each position in the line scan). The mean and SD are calculated. and regions exceeding 1.5 SD are excised to create a point-by-point baseline to normalize the whole image. This normalized image is used for spark detection. Potential sparks are identified as areas exceeding 2 SD above the mean.

Md.: Grune & Stratton. c1953-,Bay K 8644. an L-type Ca2+ channel agonist. was shown previously to increase resting sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ loss and convert post-rest potentiation to decay in dog and ferret ventricular muscle. Here. the effects of Bay K 8644 on local SR Ca2+ release events (Ca2+ sparks) were measured in isolated ferret ventricular myocytes. using laser scanning confocal microscopy and the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-3. The spark frequency under control conditions was fairly constant during 20 s of rest after interruption of electrical stimulation. Bay K 8644 (100 nmol/L) increased the spark frequency by 466-90% of control at constant SR Ca2+ load but did not change the spatial and temporal characteristics of individual sparks. The increase in spark frequency was maintained throughout the period of rest. The increase in Ca2+ spark frequency induced by Bay K 8644 was not affected by superfusion with Ca2 …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:GYcXSSpN504C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14447782144951202531&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

52487,Ca transport from the cytoplasm and dynamic cellular Ca balance in cardiac myocytes,1996,Donald M Bers,,,,541-551,Springer. Dordrecht,In cardiac muscle Ca is in a dynamic yet delicate balance. The strength of cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation depend critically on the intracellular [Ca] ([Ca]i). There are several Ca transport systems and buffers which are involved in the regulation of [Ca]i on a beat to beat basis. Figure 1 illustrates some of the key processes involved. During the action potential Ca enters the cytosol via sarcolemmal Ca channels as Ca current (ICa) and also in exchange for intracellular Na as Na/Ca exchange. When [Na]i is at normal resting levels (∼7–10 mM) the amount of Ca influx via Na/Ca exchange is probably small compared to that which enters via ICa. On the other hand. when [Na]i is elevated (e.g. during inhibition of the (Na + K) ATPase pump by digitalis glycosides) the amounts may be more comparable [1].,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:e84hm74t-eoC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-3990-8_45,,,,,0

This approach measures net transmembrane Ca2+ movements—that is. influx–efflux. by all transport mechanisms with relatively good time resolution. This may be an advantage for comparison with assessments by a single transport mechanism. such as Ca2+ current (ICa) measurements made using voltage–clamp methods. Compared to 45Ca2+ flux measurements. the Ca2+ microelectrode approach has the advantages of being on-line. having much better time resolution. and can sometimes detect smaller changes because of inherent internal controls. On the other hand. the Ca2+ microelectrode approach does not readily allow assessment of unidirectional fluxes as can be done during 45Ca2+ washout experiments.

National Institutes of Health,"The surface of the myocardial cell is composed of a lipid bilayer covered by a glycocalyx composed of mucopolysaccharide. glycoprotein. and glycolipid. The glycocalyx plus phospholipids of the bilayer contain large numbers of fixed negative charges and are sites of calcium (Ca) binding. Studies which compare the amount of Ca bound to the sarcolemmal-glycocalyx complex with force development support the proposal that this bound Ca controls the amount available to the contractile proteins and thus controls contractility. There are two classes of binding sites. one of high affinity and one of low affinity. The highaffinity sites are relatively few in number and may function in maintenance of the structural integrity of the membrane. The more abundant low-affinity sites are proposed to bind the Ca which modulates force development. Entry of this Ca is via a"" pore"" or"" channel"" and via a"" carrier"" system. The latter couples the outward movement of sodium (Na) to the inward movement of Ca.

52528,Rat Ventricular Myocytes,,Leif Hove-Madsen and Donald M Bers,,,,,,"Ca'+ uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and free [Ca2""] were measured simultaneously with indo 1 and a Ca'+-selective minielectrode in suspensions of permeabilized rabbit or rat ventricular myocytes ('-'10 mg/mL protein). In the presence of 25. umol/L ruthenium red and 10 mmol/L oxalate. the K. for Ca2 uptake by the SR was' 250 nmol/L in rabbit and rat ventricular myocytes. The maximal Cauptake rate was 2.4 times higher in rat than in rabbit. Addition of 5 nmol thapsigargin (TG) per milligram cell protein abolished Ca2+ uptake completely in both species. The [TG] necessary for a half-maximal reduction of the uptake rate (K1. 2) was 55 pmol/mg cell protein for rabbit and 390 pmol/mg cell protein for rat. Assuming that the number of pump sites is two times the concentration of TG necessary to inhibit half of the Ca21 pump activity (ie. the TG affinity is very high). the density of pump sites is 7.7. mol/kg wet wt for rabbit and 54.6. umol/kg wet wt for rat. Despite a fivefold decrease of the Ca2+ uptake rate by a submaximal [TG]. the permeabilized myocytes were still able to lower the free [Ca2+] to< 150 nmol/L from a peak value> 10. umol/L. The relative inhibition of Cauptake by TG did not depend on the free [Ca2+]. Addition of more than 5 nmol TG per milligram cell protein abolished Ca2+ uptake by the SR completely in< 15 seconds and reduced the uptake rate by 95% in 5 seconds. We conclude that TG can rapidly and completely inhibit the SR Ca2 pump and that there may be more pump sites in rat than in rabbit ventricle.(Circ Res. 1993; 73: 820-828.)",True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:TewouNez5YAC,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.930.7965&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.930.7965&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0
52529,Sudden Cardiac Death Compendium,,Stefan Wagner and Lars S Maier and Donald M Bers,,,,,,Despite improvements in the therapy of underlying heart disease. sudden cardiac death is a major cause of death worldwide. Disturbed Na and Ca handling is known to be a major predisposing factor for life-threatening tachyarrhythmias. In cardiomyocytes. many ion channels and transporters. including voltage-gated Na and Ca channels. cardiac ryanodine receptors. Na/Ca-exchanger. and SR Ca-ATPase are involved in this regulation. We have learned a lot about the pathophysiological relevance of disturbed ion channel function from monogenetic disorders. Changes in the gating of a single ion channel and the activity of an ion pump suffice to dramatically increase the propensity for arrhythmias even in structurally normal hearts. Nevertheless. patients with heart failure with acquired dysfunction in many ion channels and transporters exhibit profound dysregulation of Na and Ca handling and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and are especially prone to arrhythmias. A deeper understanding of the underlying arrhythmic principles is mandatory if we are to improve their outcome. This review addresses basic tachyarrhythmic mechanisms. the underlying ionic mechanisms and the consequences for ion homeostasis. and the situation in complex diseases like heart failure.(Circ Res. 2015; 116: 1956-1970.

52533,3700-Pos Activation of Reverse Na+-Ca2+ Exchange by the Na+ Current during an Action Potential Augments the Calcium Transient: Evidence from NCX Knockout Mice Robert K. Larbig1 …,,Daisuke Sato and Donald M Bers,,,,,,The hypothesis that Na+ influx during the action potential activates reverse Na+-Ca2+ exchange (NCX) and subsequent entry of trigger Ca2+ is controversial. To test this hypothesis. we monitored intracellular Ca2+ with fura-2 before and after selectively inactivating INa just prior to a simulated action potential in patch clamped ventricular myocytes isolated from adult wild-type (WT) and NCX knockout (KO) mice (Circ Res. 2004; 95: 604-611). We inactivated INa using a slow ramp prepulse to À45mV to avoid rapid Na+ influx. In WT cells. inactivation of INa decreased the Ca2+ transient amplitude by 52.6 5 5.3%(p< 0.001. n= 14) and reduced its release flux (measured as the maximum rate of rise) by 47.0 5 4.6%(p< 0.001. n= 14). There was no effect on diastolic Ca2+. In striking contrast. Ca2+ transients in NCX KO myocytes were unaffected by the presence or absence of INa (n= 5). We next investigated the effect of INa on the extent of transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx in WT and KO myocytes after depleting SR Ca2+ using thapsigargin and ryanodine. In WT cells. inactivation of INa decreased Ca2+ influx by 37.8 5 6.0% and reduced the flux of Ca2+ entry (maximum rate of rise) by 30.6 5 7.7%. This effect was absent in the KO cells. We conclude that Na+ current and reverse NCX modulate Ca2+ release in murine WT cardiomyocytes by augmenting the pool of diadic cleft Ca2+ that triggers ryanodine receptors. This may be an important mechanism for Ca2+ release and therefore regulation of contractility in the heart. The use of cardiac-specific NCX KO myocytes provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate a role for NCX in the initiation of cardiac …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:WTQy_8Ay2UsC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82280089.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82280089.pdf,0

February 27. 2012,,Tetsuro Oda and Yi Yang and Xiyuan Lu and Razvan L Cornea and Bradley R Fruen and Donald M Bers,,,,,,Calmodulin (CaM) is an important intracellular protein which modulates many cell functions by interacting with other enzymes. The skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is regulated by both Ca2+ and CaM. CaM was reported to be able to effectively increase channel opening at low Ca2+ and decrease channel opening at high Ca2+. However. which Ca2+ binding site of CaM serves as the switch in the biphasic Ca2+ dependence of RyR1 activation remains unclear. To address this question. we engineered a series of CaM variants with increased and decreased Ca2+ binding affinities. Using various spectroscopic methods such as circular dichroism (CD). fluorescence. high resolution NMR and single channel activity measurements. we have shown that Ca2+ binding to CaM’s C-terminal acts as the switch converting CaM from a RyR1 activator to a channel inhibitor. These results further indicate that targeting CaM’s Ca2+ affinity may be a valid strategy to tune the activation profile of ion channels. We then applied peptide model and mini-domain approaches to dissect the possible interaction modes between CaM and RyR1 in the absence and presence of calcium. Using 1H-15N HSQC. residual dipolar coupling (RDC). and fluorescence spectroscopy. we have shown that that both Ca2+ CaM and Apo-CaM differentially interact with different regions of RyR1 with different binding modes and affinity.,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:jtOrAYjvdewC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82585970.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82585970.pdf,0

In adult rabbit left ventricular cardiac myocytes. sex and apex-base differences in cardiac L-type calcium current (ICa-L) levels were found to affect susceptibility to arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations (EADs). We have now investigated the role of ICa-L in EAD formation in right ventricular myocytes using the patch clamp technique to ascertain apex-base distribution and properties of the L-type calcium current in adult males and females. ICa-L density measured at 0mV was 84.6% higher in female (7.250. 83 pA/pF. n= 8) than male base myocytes (3.950. 38. n= 12. p< 0.001). Regionally. the female right ventricle demonstrated 56.5% higher ICa-L density at the base (7.250. 83 pA/pF. n= 8) than apex (4.5650. 45 pA/pF. n= 9. p< 0.02). No gender differences in ICa-L density were seen in male-female apex myocytes. Additionally. we found no gender or regional differences in the voltage dependence of ICa-L activation and inactivation. Utilizing this data. we performed numerical simulations with a modified version of the Luo Rudy mathematical model of cardiac action potentials (APs). Under 50% suppression of the rapidly inactivating delayed rectifier potassium current to model Long QT Syndrome Type 2 (LQTS2). female base myocyte simulations exhibited longer APs and increased EAD vulnerability as compared to male base myocytes.

February 22. 2010,,Reverse-Rate Dependency and Eleonora Grandi and Donald M Bers,,,,,,Objective: NS5806 activates the transient outward potassium current (Ito) in canine ventricular cells. We compared the effects of NS5806 on canine ventricular versus atrial tissues and myocytes. Methods: NS5806 (10 mM) was evaluated in arterially-perfused canine right atrial and left ventricular wedges. Atrial and ventricular epi-and endocardial cells were isolated by enzymatic dissociation. Current and voltage-clamp recordings were made in the absence and presence of NS5806. Results: In ventricular wedges NS5806 increased phase 1 repolarization in epi-and midmyocardial cells. A minor effect on conduction and upstroke velocity also was observed. In contrast. application of NS5806 to atrial preparations slowed upstroke velocity and reduced excitability. consistent with sodium channel block. In ventricular myocytes. NS5806 increased the magnitude of Ito by 80% and 16% in epi and endo. respectively (at þ40 mV). In atrial myocytes. NS5806 increased peak Ito by 25% and had no effect on the sustained pedestal current. IKur. INa density in atrial myocytes was nearly 100% greater than in endocardial myocytes. NS5806 caused a negative shift in steady-state mid-inactivation (V1/2) for both cell types (73.950. 27 to À77. 350.21 mV for endocardial and À82. 650.12 to À85. 150.11 mV for atrial cells). The shift in V1/2 resulted in a reduction of INa in both cell types. However. the more negative V1/2 in atrial cells suggests that atrial cells lose excitability at more depolarized voltages than endocardial cells which may explain the greater reduction of excitability in atrial vs ventricular wedges by NS5806.

Joseph C. Li. Mounir Khafaga. Linda L. Lee. Luiza Mamikonian. Sanda Despa. Donald M. Bers. Phospholemman (PLM or FXYD1) associates with and modulates Na pump (NKA) function in a manner similar to phospholamban (PLB) regulation of SERCA. That is. PLM inhibits NKA by reducing its [Na] i-affinity and PLM phosphorylation relieves this inhibition. We have also shown that PLM forms homo-oligomers (as does PLB) but it is unknown how PLM-PLM interactions occur or what functional role PLM oligomers have. Here we use site-directed mutagenesis and FRET to identify which PLM residues are critical to the PLM-NKA and PLM-PLM association. respectively. We hypothesize that mutations affecting PLM-PLM affinity will enhance PLM-NKA complexes and display stronger NKA inhibition. and vice versa. Based on crystal NKAFXYD structure. the PLM sites G20.

Using a cell-in-gel system that imposes an afterload during cardiomyocyte contraction. we found that nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was involved in transducing mechanical load to alter Ca2+ dynamics. In mouse ventricular myocytes. afterload increased the systolic Ca2+ transient. which enhanced contractility to counter mechanical load. but also caused spontaneous Ca2+ sparks during diastole that could be arrhythmogenic. The increases in the Ca2+ transient and sparks were attributable to increased ryanodine receptor (RyR) sensitivity because the amount of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum load was unchanged. Either pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of nNOS (or NOS1). but not of eNOS (or NOS3). prevented afterload-induced Ca2+ sparks. This differential effect may arise from localized NO signaling. arising from the proximity of nNOS to RyR. as determined by super-resolution imaging. Ca2+-calmodulin–dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2) also contributed to afterload-induced Ca2+ sparks. Cardiomyocytes from a mouse model of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy exhibited enhanced mechanotransduction and frequent arrhythmogenic Ca2+ sparks. Inhibiting nNOS and CaMKII. but not NOX2. in cardiomyocytes from this model eliminated the Ca2+ sparks. suggesting mechanotransduction activated nNOS and CaMKII independently from NOX2.

52560,Altered Cardiac Myocyte Ca Regulation In Heart,,Donald M Bers,,,,,,Downloaded from up. This reduces the SR Ca available to be released during subsequent ECC. In most HF models. overall [Ca] i decline is slowed. and this contributes to diastolic dysfunction (hampering diastolic ventricular filling). However. we also find that a large increase in NCX function can compensate for a moderate decrease in SR Ca-ATPase function in HF such that the rates of [Ca] i decline and relaxation are relatively normal in our rabbit HF model (42. 43). despite the reduced SR Ca content that both effects cause. The balance may differ among different HF stages and etiologies. For example. in end-stage human HF. we found that the reduction in SR Ca content and rate of [Ca] i decline was primarily due to reduced SR Ca-ATPase function. with little alteration in NCX function (37). Hasenfuss et al.(20) found two groups of HF patients. one with relatively normal diastolic function where NCX expression …,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:QKtdBID3u5MC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16392841584869192337&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

52562,2924-Pos Pharmacological Characterization Of Nuclear NFAT Translocation In Cardiac Myocytes,,Andreas Rinne and Nidhi Kapur and Julie Bossuyt and Donald M Bers and Lothar A Blatter and Kathrin Banach,,,,,,Nuclear localization of NFAT transcription factors activates prehypertrophic genes related to cardiac hypertrophic remodeling. Dephosphorylation of cytoplasmic (inactive) NFAT by Calcineurin activates Ca-dependent translocation of NFAT to the nucleus. Although this mechanism is well defined in many cell types. little is known about the pathways that control nuclear translocation of NFAT in cardiac tissue. We analyzed subcellular localizations of NFAT in cat atrial and rabbit ventricular myocytes in response to experimental interventions that interfere with nuclear import and export pathways for NFAT proteins. Myocytes were infected with recombinant adenoviruses encoding for NFAT-GFP fusion proteins (isoforms NFATc1 and NFATc3) and kept in culture (up to 48 h) to allow detectable protein expression. Ca signals were measured in the presence of NFAT-GFP using the Ca-sensitive dye Rhod-2.

Luminal stimulation of RyRs involves three Ca2+ sensing mechanisms on both the luminal and cytoplasmic side of the RyR (Laver. 2007); namely the luminal Ca2+-activation site (L-site. 60 µmol/l affinity). the cytoplasmic activation site (A-site. 0.9 µmol/l affinity) and the high affinity cytoplasmic Ca2+-inactivation site (I,True,SHe5R2EAAAAJ:ji7lAbPyDbYC,0,http://aups.org.au/Proceedings/38/151P/151P.pdf,,,,,0

52568,1477-Pos HDAC5 Nuclear Export Is Stimulated By Angiotensin II In Adult Cardiac Myocytes,,Kathryn G Helmstadter and Joshua T Maxwell and Karl J Hench and Gregory A Mignery and Julie Bossuyt and Donald M Bers,,,,,,We previously showed that there are fundamental differences between endothelin-1 (ET-1) and phenylephrine (PE)-mediated HDAC5 phosphorylation and nuclear export. ET-1-dependent export requires a local IP3-dependent perinuclear Ca signaling pathway and is mediated by CaMKII and Protein Kinase D (PKD). but not PKC.(JCI. 2006; 116: 675–82). However PE. another Gq-coupled pathway. was relatively Ca-independent and required PKC-dependent PKD activity. but not CaMKII or IP3 (BJ. 2007. 92: 622a). We now examine a parallel hypertrophic pathway activated by angiotensin II (AngII) which may be similar to ET-1 and PE pathways. We infected adult rabbit cardiomyocytes with an adenovirus encoding GFP-HDAC5 fusion protein and tracked levels of nuclear export with confocal microscopy. In quiescent cells.

Given that individuals in the firm most closely influenced by the CEO are members of the top management team (TMT). we focus on the CEO‐TMT interface as one important intervening mechanism. Specifically. our tested model suggests that CEO tenure indirectly influences performance through its direct influences on TMT risk‐taking propensity and the firm's pursuit of entrepreneurial initiatives.

The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent proteases that are responsible for proteolytic degradation of specific ECM components. Regulating the activity of the MMPs at both mRNA and/or protein levels modulates the degradation of the ECM components which in turn alter cellular invasion. Although most MMPs are regulated via similar mechanisms at the mRNA and protein levels. the modulation of gelatinase A is unique. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate gelatinase A is important since expression and activation of this particular MMP is consistently correlated with a majority of malignant phenotypes.

52639,A spectrum of severe familial liver disorders associate with telomerase mutations,2009,Rodrigo T Calado and Joshua A Regal and David E Kleiner and David S Schrump and Nathan R Peterson and Veronica Pons and Stephen J Chanock and Peter M Lansdorp and Neal S Young,4,PloS one,11,e7926,Public Library of Science,Background Telomerase is an enzyme specialized in maintaining telomere lengths in highly proliferative cells. Loss-of-function mutations cause critical telomere shortening and are associated with the bone marrow failure syndromes dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anemia and with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Here. we sought to determine the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with telomerase loss-of-function mutations.  Methodology/Principal Findings Sixty-nine individuals from five unrelated families with a variety of hematologic. hepatic. and autoimmune disorders were screened for telomerase complex gene mutations; leukocyte telomere length was measured by flow fluorescence in situ hybridization in mutation carriers and some non-carriers; the effects of the identified mutations on telomerase activity were determined; and genetic and clinical data were correlated. In six generations of a large family. a loss-of-function mutation in the telomerase enzyme gene TERT associated with severe telomere shortening and a range of hematologic manifestations. from macrocytosis to acute myeloid leukemia. with severe liver diseases marked by fibrosis and inflammation. and one case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis but not with autoimmune disorders. Additionally. we identified four unrelated families in which loss-of-function TERC or TERT gene mutations tracked with marrow failure. pulmonary fibrosis. and a spectrum of liver disorders.

Members of the collagenase family of enzymes have been implicated as central mediators of a number of both physiologic and pathologic processes. The 72-kDa type IV collagenase is secreted as a latent proenzyme. complexed with tissue inhibitor of metalloprotein-ase-2 (TIMP-2). Like other members of the collagenase family. this enzyme complex must be converted to a catalytically active form for proteolytic remodeling of extracellular matrix to occur. In the current study we demonstrate an inducible cell-mediated activation of the 72-kDa type IV procollagenase/TIMP-2 complex.

A biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. especially when there is a complex clinical differential diagnosis that includes DILI. A biopsy can also be used to stage the severity of hepatotoxicity so that a necessary agent may be continued. Alternatively. a drug or toxin may only be implicated after a biopsy is performed. particularly in the case of subacute or chronic liver injury. The pathologist should approach the biopsy systematically by first classifying the disease and then working with the clinician to include or exclude etiologies in the pathological differential diagnosis.

Much of the coordinate (physiological) or discoordinate (pathological) degradation of the ECM is catalyzed by a class of proteases known as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) or matrixins. Matrixins are a family of homologous Zn atom dependent endopeptidases that are usually secreted from cells as inactive zymogens. Net degradative activity in the extracellular environment is regulated by specific activators and inhibitors. One member of the matrixin family. gelatinase A. is regulated differently from other MMPs. suggesting that it may play a unique role in cell–matrix interactions. including cell invasion.

To address this from a histological perspective and to examine the significance of residual histological findings as an indication of prior NASH. we looked back at biopsies in patients who presented with cirrhosis without sufficient histological features to diagnose NASH but who had prior histologically confirmed non-cirrhotic NASH.Methods: Seven patients were identified with biopsy pairs showing non-specific (cryptogenic) cirrhosis in the latest specimen and a prior biopsy showing non-cirrhotic NASH. Using an expanded NASH-CRN system scored blindly by light microscopy. we compared the early and late biopsies to each other and to a cohort of 13 patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C without co-existing metabolic syndrome.Results: Macrosteatosis. although uniformly present in the non-cirrhotic NASH specimens. declined in the late stage cirrhotic NASH specimens and was not useful in the distinction of late cirrhotic NASH from cirrhotic viral hepatitis. However. the presence of ballooned cells. Mallory-Denk bodies. and megamitochondria and the absence of apoptotic bodies were significantly different in late stage cirrhotic NASH compared to cirrhosis due to hepatitis C.Conclusions: Histologically advanced NASH presenting as non-specific or cryptogenic cirrhosis has residual changes which are consistent with prior steatohepatitis but which differ from cirrhosis due to hepatitis C.

New York. NY 10001. USA.,The liver biopsy has long been the gold standard for the evaluation of the state of liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Although a liver biopsy continues to be a recommended part of the work-up of this disease. its routine use is challenged by the increasing effectiveness of therapy and by surrogate biochemical tests that give information about the stage of disease. Nevertheless. recent studies have shown that histological features other than stage may have predictive value for disease progression and therapeutic response to interferon-based regimens. Pathologists can increase the relevance and utility of the liver biopsy in chronic hepatitis C by the systematic reporting of steatosis and iron accumulation in addition to stage and grade. and by identifying certain potential confounding liver diseases. such as steatohepatitis and hereditary hemochromatosis.

We identified a novel gram-negative rod in excised lymph nodes from a patient with CGD. Gram-negative rods grew on charcoal-yeast extract. but conventional tests could not identify it. The best 50 matches of the 16S rRNA (using BLAST) were all members of the family Acetobacteraceae. with the closest match being Gluconobacter sacchari. Patient serum showed specific band recognition in whole lysate immunoblot. We used mouse models of CGD to determine whether this organism was a genuine CGD pathogen. Intraperitoneal injection of gp91phox −/− (X-linked) and p47 phox −/− (autosomal recessive) mice with this bacterium led to larger burdens of organism recovered from knockout compared with wild-type mice. Knockout mouse lymph nodes had histopathology that was similar to that seen in our patient. We recovered organisms with 16S rRNA sequence identical to the patient's original isolate from the infected mice. We identified a novel gram-negative rod from a patient with CGD.

The role of prognostic markers that may assist in evaluating aggressive behavior in these tumors has not been fully studied. We performed a retrospective study of 31 parathyroid lesions. including 10 adenomas. 10 atypical lesions. and 11 carcinomas. to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic role of the MiB-1. p53. RB. and bcl-2 markers by immunohistochemical techniques. The mean tumor proliferative fraction (TPF). expressed as the number of MiB-1-positive nuclei per 1000 cells. was 20.3 in adenomas (range. 5-51). 20.0 in atypical lesions (range. 8-36). and 79.8 in carcinomas (range. 4-133). Only 1 of 20 benign lesions had a TPF more than 40. and only 2 of 11 carcinomas had a TPF less than 40. One atypical lesion and two carcinomas showed scattered cells positive for p53. Patients with the adenoma with increased TPF and the atypical lesion with positive p53 have been free of disease for 16 months. bcl-2 was expressed in 7 (70%) of 10 adenomas. 2 (20%) of 10 atypical lesions. and 4 (36%) of 11 carcinomas. Two of the 11 carcinomas were RB negative. whereas all of the 20 benign lesions were RB positive. We conclude that high TPF (greater than 40 as measured by staining with MiB-1) strongly correlates with malignancy and. therefore. may be useful in the diagnosis of carcinomas. Negative RB stain. although not a common event. may be helpful to exclude benign lesions.

52728,Increase in hepatic iron stores following prolonged therapy with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C,1994,Adrian M Di Bisceglie and Bruce R Bacon and David E Kleiner and Jay H Hoofnagle,21,Journal of hepatology,6,1109-1112,Elsevier,Ribavirin. an oral nucleoside analogue being evaluated as therapy for chronic hepatitis C. is associated with hemolysis. Other hemolytic conditions are known to be associated with accumulation of iron within the liver. We therefore examined hepatic iron stores before and after 6 to 12 months of therapy with ribavirin in 15 patients with chronic hepatitis C. Although there were no significant changes in serum iron or ferritin levels. hepatic iron staining increased in almost all patients. Using a ranking system to quantitate the amount of hepatic iron staining. we found that the mean rank increased from 3.9 to 8.5 after therapy (p<0.01). In six patients in whom hepatic tissue was available for determination of hepatic iron. concentrations also increased in all cases from a mean of 826 to 1857 μg/g dry weight (p<0.01).

Obesity used to be a disease mainly of adults; however. it is now recognized to be a major problem in children as well. Concerns have been raised about the rising incidence of obesity coupled with increasing awareness of its major co-morbidities: cardiovascular events and diabetes [4]. Obesity in children is also associated with poor health outcomes. including early onset of diabetes and hypertension.The major manifestation of obesity in the liver is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)[5].

Several lncRNAs have been reported to play a role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However. most studies have analyzed lncRNAs only in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC or in a single group of HCC patients regardless of the viral etiology. To investigate whether lncRNAs are differentially expressed in HCC of different viral etiology. we profiled 101 disease-related lncRNAs. including 25 lncRNAs previously associated with HCC. in liver specimens obtained from well-characterized patients with HBV-. hepatitis C virus (HCV)-. or hepatitis D virus (HDV)-associated HCC. We identified eight novel HCC-related lncRNAs that were significantly dysregulated in HCC tissues compared to their surrounding non-tumorous tissues. Some of these lncRNAs were significantly dysregulated predominantly in one specific hepatitis virus-related HCC. including PCAT-29 in HBV-related HCC. aHIF and PAR5 in HCV-related HCC. and Y3 in HDV-related HCC. Among the lncRNAs previously reported in HCC. we found that DBH-AS1. hDREH and hPVT1 were differentially expressed in HCC of different viral etiology. Our study suggests that HCC of different viral etiology is regulated by different lncRNAs. The identification of lncRNAs unique to specific hepatitis virus-related HCC may provide new tools for improving the diagnosis of HCC and open new avenues for disease-specific therapeutic interventions.,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:Azgs6IHzeyYC,41,https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-016-1085-4,8495705193822020490,/scholar?cites=8495705193822020490,,https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-016-1085-4,0

The dramatic clinical course of acute liver failure (ALF) has posed major limitations to investigating the molecular mechanisms of liver regeneration and the role of HSPC in this setting. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of liver regeneration in 4 patients who underwent liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated ALF.   Methods and Findings Gene expression profiling of 17 liver specimens from the 4 ALF cases and individual specimens from 10 liver donors documented a distinct gene signature for ALF. However. unsupervised multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering identified two clusters of ALF that segregated according to histopathological severity massive hepatic necrosis (MHN; 2 patients) and submassive hepatic necrosis (SHN; 2 patients). We found that ALF is characterized by a strong HSPC gene signature. along with ductular reaction. both of which are more prominent in MHN. Interestingly. no evidence of further lineage differentiation was seen in MHN. whereas in SHN we detected cells with hepatocyte-like morphology. Strikingly. ALF was associated with a strong tumorigenesis gene signature. MHN had the greatest upregulation of stem cell genes (EpCAM. CK19. CK7). whereas the most up-regulated genes in SHN were related to cellular growth and proliferation.

MA,Extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover is a critical step in the tissue remodeling that accompanies many physiologic as well as pathologic processes. Normal remodeling events. such as wound healing and trophoblast implantation. require coordinated synthesis and removal of ECM components. These physiologic processes are strictly regulated in a spatial and temporal fashion. and are usually limited in extent. They result in a functionally intact matrix and preservation of tissue boundaries. Pathologic events may result in the extensive and uncontrolled ECM destruction that is often seen in the inflammatory collagen vascular diseases. Such processes cause the loss of normal matrix boundaries and matrix functions. Alternately. inactivation of the matrix degradative machinery may result in excessive ECM accumulation that disrupts normal tissue structure and function.

Horiguchi and colleagues surprisingly found more inflammatory cells. eg. neutrophils. but less necrosis/apoptosis in the liver of STAT3myeÀ/À mice than in wild-type mice after carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment.

It is not only an uncommon reason for liver biopsy. but the pathology of DILI is spread across the entire spectrum of hepatic injury patterns. It is important for the pathologist to suspect DILI when the histological changes are unusual or out of synchronicity with the patient's history. A systematic evaluation approach will yield the most information. It begins with the characterization of the general pattern of injury which. for most cases. will be found in a handful of necroinflammatory and cholestatic patterns.

The first and most important is to establish the pattern(s) of injury which are present. Patterns of injury represent stereotypical responses of an organ to injury and relate to specific aetiologies of liver damage. The pattern of injury and the histological details of that injury can then be analysed with respect to the patient's intercurrent diseases and medication history. The specific expertise of the pathologist can be used to weigh the prospect of DILI against the likelihood of other explanations of injury. The second challenge is to characterize specific types of injury and the severity of injury. both of which may have importance for clinical decision‐making and prognosis.

Expressing recombinant proteins in dairy animals to alter their milk composition is considered beneficial for human health. However. relatively little is known about the expression profile of the proteins in milk derived from transgenic cloned animals. In this study. we compared the proteome and nutrient composition of the colostrum and mature milk from three lines of transgenic cloned (TC) cattle that specifically express human α-lactalbumin (TC-LA). lactoferrin (TC-LF) or lysozyme (TC-LZ) in the mammary gland with those from cloned non-transgenic (C) and conventionally bred normal animals (N). Protein expression profile identification was performed. 37 proteins were specifically expressed in the TC animals and 70 protein spots that were classified as 22 proteins with significantly altered expression levels in the TC and C groups compared to N group. Assessment of the relationship of the transgene effect and normal variability in the milk protein profiles in each group indicated that the variation in the endogenous protein profiles of the three TC groups was within the limit of natural variability. More than 50 parameters for the colostrum and mature milk were compared between each TC group and the N controls. The data revealed essentially similar profiles for all groups. This comprehensive study demonstrated that in TC cattle the mean values for the measured milk parameters were all within the normal range. suggesting that the expression of a transgene does not affect the composition of milk.,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:jE2MZjpN3IcC,16,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049697,3018450385447366167,/scholar?cites=3018450385447366167,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049697,0

However. in a complicated medical practice. a gold standard test can be invasive. expensive. and its result may not always be available for all the subjects under study. Thus. a gold standard test is implemented only when it is necessary and possible. This leads to the so‐called ‘verification bias’. meaning that subjects with verified disease status (also called label) are not selected in a completely random fashion. In this paper. we propose a new Bayesian approach for estimating an ROC curve based on continuous data following the popular semiparametric binormal model in the presence of verification bias.

Unlike the more prevalent liver diseases of chronic viral hepatitis and steatohepatitis. there is neither a clearly defined role nor professional guidelines for the use of liver biopsy in DILI. In addition. the results of liver histology in DILI patients are not formally incorporated into current causalityassessment instruments or scoring algorithms. Nevertheless. some clinical circumstances wherein liver biopsy may prove useful can be articulated. As in other liver diseases. the liver biopsy can fulfill two main purposes in patients with suspected DILI.

Our study aimed to examine the association of telomere length with survival of patients with HCC.   Methods We measured telomere length in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 126 persons with HCC in the United States (U.S.) who were followed for mortality outcomes. Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured by a monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between telomere length and all-cause mortality. We also examined associations between telomere length and patient characteristics using multiple linear regression.   Results During a mean follow-up of 6.0 years. 79 deaths occurred among 114 individuals for whom survival data were available. The ratio of RTL in tumor relative to non-tumor tissue was greater for individuals with regional or distant stage tumors (0.97) than localized stage tumors (0.77). and for individuals with grade III or IV tumors (0.95) than grade II (0.88) or grade I (0.67) tumors. An RTL ratio ≥1 was not associated with survival (HR 0.92. 95% CI 0.55. 1.55) compared to a ratio <1. after adjusting for age at diagnosis. sex. tumor stage and tumor size. Similarly.

The mechanism by which HBV activates UPR has not been fully defined. To investigate this. HepG2-NTCP cells and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) were either infected with HBV or transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing replication-competent HBV genome or individual HBV genes. UPR markers were evaluated by qPCR. Western blotting. and immunofluorescence. Apoptosis and cell viability were measured by Caspase-3/7 and ATPlite assay respectively. We found that UPR markers were induced by the overexpression of HBsAg in HepG2-NTCP cells and PHHs. Elevation of UPR-induced genes showed a dose-dependent correlation with HBsAg levels. In HBV-infected livers. GGHs also demonstrated excessive accumulation of HBsAg associated with increased BIP/GRP78 staining. a marker of UPR. Prolonged activation of UPR by HBsAg overexpression induced signs of apoptosis. Overexpression of HBsAg can induce ER stress through protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) pathway in vitro. and may be linked to the appearance of GGHs. The activation of UPR by HBsAg may sensitize hepatocytes to cell death and result in possible subsequent cellular changes leading to a premalignant phenotype.

The diagnosis of PTTM is challenging to make pre-mortem and guidelines on treatment are lacking. A 45-year-old woman with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix developed symptoms of dyspnea and evidence of right heart failure during a phase I clinical trial with cediranib and durvalumab. After an extensive evaluation. pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension was confirmed by right heart catheterization. Vasodilator therapy was initiated but resulted in the development of symptomatic hypoxemia and was discontinued. Despite continued supportive care. she continued to decline and was transitioned to hospice care. At autopsy. the cause of her right heart failure was found to be due to PTTM with features of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). PTTM and PVOD are important diagnoses to consider in patients with a malignancy and the development of right heart failure and may be manifestations of a spectrum of similar disease processes.,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:IHkkN1K1AlAC,7,https://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-018-0681-x,628018137940147623,/scholar?cites=628018137940147623,,https://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-018-0681-x,0

Sixty-two biopsy-confirmed ECD patients were divided into those with no ILD (19.5%). minimal ILD (32%). mild ILD (29%). and moderate/severe ILD (19.5%). based on computed tomography (CT) findings. Dyspnea affected at least half of the patients with mild or moderate/severe ILD. Diffusion capacity was significantly reduced in ECD patients with minimal ILD. Disease severity was inversely correlated with pulmonary function measurements; no correlation with BRAF V600E mutation status was seen. Reticulations and ground-glass opacities were the predominant findings on CT images. Automated CT scores were significantly higher in patients with moderate/severe ILD. compared to those in other groups. Immunostaining of lung biopsies was consistent with ECD. Histopathology findings included subpleural and septal fibrosis. with areas of interspersed normal lung. diffuse interstitial fibrosis. histiocytes with foamy cytoplasm embedded in fibrosis. lymphoid aggregates. and focal type II alveolar cell hyperplasia. In conclusion. ILD of varying severity may affect a high proportion of ECD patients. Histopathology features of ILD in ECD can mimic interstitial fibrosis patterns observed in idiopathic ILD.

52954,On Beyond Staging and Grading: Liver Biopsy Evaluation in a Post-Treatment World,2017,David E Kleiner,65,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",5,1432,NIH Public Access,To a pathologist. the concepts of staging and grading are a basic aspect of the histological evaluation of disease. The idea of disease stage encompasses extent: how far the disease has progressed from its inception to end stage. Staging disease has its most familiar application in the field of oncology. in which disease specific staging systems are used to mark a malignancy’s progress from early in-situ lesions to metastasis. Cancer stage has important applications for both therapy and prognosis. It is easily defined and understood. as it is based on discrete anatomic landmarks transgressed by the neoplasm. Grading. on the other hand. is a more nebulous concept. In oncology. grading generally refers to tumor differentiation. which broadly translates to a measure of tumor aggressiveness—the pace at which the disease progresses. More poorly differentiated tumors tend to grow faster and be more invasive and less …,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:lbI08cpqPnQC,7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5397352/,11102142560239572070,/scholar?cites=11102142560239572070,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5397352/,0

53019,The role of the hepatopathologist in the assessment of drug‐induced liver injury,2017,David E Kleiner,9,Clinical liver disease,2,34,Wiley-Blackwell,Hepatopathologists are sometimes asked whether they can tell that drug-induced liver injury (DILI; throughout this review. the term DILI is used to include liver injury from prescribed and over-the-counter medications. as well as injury from herbals and dietary supplements) is present simply by the pattern of changes in the liver biopsy. without any additional clinical information. The question misunderstands the role of the liver biopsy and the role of the hepatic pathologist as an interpreter of biopsy findings. In reality. hepatopathologists are sophisticated interpreters of the tissue injury and can synthesize the information obtained from a liver biopsy with the clinical information to provide an expert opinion. not only of the likelihood of drug injury but of other important information from the biopsy. 1,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:3A3nxV7CjKIC,3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5604852/,2776840225491242827,/scholar?cites=2776840225491242827,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5604852/,0

MEDI4736 is a human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1. Blockage of ligation between PD-L1 and PD1 induces local immune activation and prevents anergy and exhaustion of effector T-cells. Several studies have documented an increase in peripheral antitumor immunity following radiation. This effect is evidently too weak to be clinically relevant. but has the potential to be boosted by immune modulation. The underlying hypothesis of this study is that the effect of immune checkpoint inhibition (accomplished via tremelimumab and/or MEDI4736) treatment can be enhanced by radiation in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma.

53034,6 Pathology of hepatitis C,2000,David E Kleiner,2,,,107-III,Academic Press,This chapter discusses the pathology of hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis is a pattern of liver injury characterized by immune-mediated hepatocellular destruction accompanied by progressive scarring and alteration of architecture that ends as cirrhosis. The pattern of injury is distinctive in that it may be distinguished from other forms of liver disease. particularly other patterns of chronic injury. such as chronic cholestatic liver disease and steatohepatitis. Therefore. it is important for the pathologist to communicate not only the pattern of injury. but also the histologic severity and stage. The percutaneous needle biopsy is the most common method used by clinicians to obtain information about liver histology in chronic hepatitis C.

53048,When Is It NAFLD and When Is It ALD? Can the Histologic Evaluation of a Liver Biopsy Guide the Clinical Evaluation?,2016,Elizabeth M Brunt and David E Kleiner,,2016,,72-81,,Most pathology literature and nearly all clinical literature related to fatty liver disease comment that alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are indistinguishable histologically. In fact. this was the basis for the appellation offatty liver disease related to obesity in patients without significant alcohol consumption. an unfortunate “non‐” term. This may be true of steatosis and of mild forms of steatohepatitis. but pathologists have noted features that may distinguish the two. particularly in the severe form of ALD [1. 2]. These include lesions to the outflow veins described from the earliest work in ALD [3]. as well as canalicular cholestasis [4]. a lesion included in a new scoring system for alcoholic hepatitis [5]. but not a feature of NASH. In this chapter. we review the primary lesions of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases as well as features that may be unique or more common in one compared to the other. A review of the literature of comparative studies summarized conclusions of investigators that the shared lesions are often more “severe” in the severe forms of ALD [2]. Further. clinical context is essential in biopsy interpretation. Finally. grading systems for both have been published [6. 7]; the former was developed primarily for comparinglesions for clinical trials. while the latter was for prognostication for alcoholic hepatitis. The lesions utilized in these systems are a reflection of significant features. and therefore both shared and different histopathologic features of these entities can be regarded as differing histologic manifestations.

53055,Amiodarone-Induced Phospholipidosis,2011,DAVID E Kleiner,,Liver pathology. Demos Medical Publishing,,237-239,,DISCUSSIONThis case highlights an unusual histological change observed in amiodarone injury—phospholipidosis. Drug-induced phospholipidosis is essentially a lipid-storage disease in which phospholipid membranes accumulate within lysosomes as inclusion bodies (1. 2). Cationic amphiphilic drugs. such as amiodarone. are sequestered within these stacks of membranes. Phospholipidosis was first described in patients treated with diethylaminoethoxyhexestrol (trade name Coralgil) who presented with hepatosplenomegaly. When drug therapy is stopped. the drug gradually disappears from the cells and the phospholipidosis resolves. Besides amiodarone and Coralgil. a large number of drugs have been reported to cause phospholipidosis. including perhexiline maleate. chlorpheniramine. thioridazine. the aminoglycoside antibiotics. the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). tamoxifen. and others. Phospholipidosis is a dose-dependent process in which the drug gradually accumulates within lysosomes over time. There are several theories as to how the lamellar bodies form (2). Many of these amphiphilic drugs have been shown to interfere with lysosomal phospholipase either by direct inhibition or by binding to phospholipids and blocking digestion. These changes would result in the accumulation of phospholipids within the lysosome. The drugs may interfere with normal trafficking of membrane phospholipids between the plasma membrane and the Golgi so that increased amounts of phospholipids are sequestered in lysosomes. It is unclear if phospholipidosis. by itself. is toxic to cells.

Correlates of FLD and its relationship with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) overtime were examined in HIV-HBV coinfection. METHODS: From 04/28/14-11/07/18. 114 HIV-HBV adults underwent a liver biopsy and were followed for a median of 3 years (ancillary study of Hepatitis B Research Network). Steatohepatitis was based on presence of steatosis. ballooning and perisinusoidal fibrosis. FLD was defined as≥ 5% steatosis and/or steatohepatitis. RESULTS: Median age was 49 years. 93% were male. 51% black. 93% had HIV RNA< 400 copies/mL and 83% HBV DNA< 1000 IU/mL. Thirty percent had FLD (20% steatosis. 10% steatohepatitis). Those with FLD had higher median triglyceride (171 versus 100 mg/dL. P<. 01) and sdLDL (44 versus 29 mg/dL. P<. 01) and lower HDL-2C (9 versus 12 mg/dL. P=. 001).

HCV generates oxidative stress correlating with disease severity. HCV proteins increase reactive oxygen species production by stimulating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) activity. Reactive oxygen species are necessary for host defense and cell signaling; however. elevated NOX activity contributes to cancer. and NOX overexpression is associated with hepatic fibrosis. Our aim was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NOX family members are associated with HCV‐related liver damage.

Prenylation is essential for HDV particle assembly. and prenylation inhibitors abrogate HDV production in in vitro and in vivo models. We sought to test the hypothesis that targeting prenylation can inhibit HDV infections in people by doing the first proof-of-concept study of the oral prenylation inhibitor lonafarnib. evaluating its safety and antiviral efficacy.Methods: We did a phase 2a. double-blinded. randomised. placebo-controlled study in two groups of chronically infected HDV patients. Participants received lonafarnib 100 mg (group 1) or 200 mg (group 2) twice daily for 28 days and were then followed up for 6 months. Both groups enrolled six patients receiving treatment and two patients receiving placebo. Serial measurements of safety parameters. liver tests. pharmacokinetics. and virological markers were done.Findings: 71% of patients were men. median age was 38 years. and ethnic groups included Asian (50%). Caucasian (43%). and African (7%). There were no significant differences in baseline parameters between groups. At day 28. compared with placebo. mean log HDV RNA change from baseline was− 0.73 log IU/mL in group 1 (p= 0.04) and− 1.54 log IU/mL in group 2 (p= 0.002). Lonafarnib serum concentrations correlated with HDV RNA change (r2= 0.78. p< 0.0001). Biphasic viral kinetic declines were observed with a substantially shorter delay in onset of the first phase (t0= 1 day) and HDV half-life (t1/2= 1.4 days) than with peg-interferon (t0= 8.5 days.

Our goal is to investigate the rate of recurrent HBV viremia in CHB patients after HBeAg seroconversion. Methods: We retrospectively studied 88 consecutive CHB patients who achieved treatment-induced HBeAg seroconversion among the 458 HBeAg-positive patients treated with various antiviral regimens at 3 GI and liver clinics in the US between 3/1998 and 9/2010. HBeAg seroconversion was defined as loss of HBeAg and development of hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe). Recurrent HBV viremia was defined as reappearance of detectable HBV DNA (> 100 IU/mL) from nadir in two consecutive laboratory tests.

53113,Drug–Induced Cholestatic Hepatitis,2011,DAVID E Kleiner,4,Consultant Pathology,,226-228,,DISCUSSIONThe biopsy was performed because of a clinical picture complicated by a history of sarcoidosis. the positive ANA. and imaging studies that showed some abnormalities of the gallbladder but no duct dilation or stones. The biopsy presents a variety of findings. including inflammation. cholestasis. steatosis. and iron overload. The steatosis was mild and azonal in distribution. There was evidence of steatohepatitis. The iron accumulation is concerning in that there is no obvious etiology in the history but the degree of hemosiderosis is not severe enough to warrant immediate investigation. Setting aside the steatosis and iron accumulation. what remains is cholestasis and hepatitis that are not easily explained by AIH. sarcoidosis. or intermittent biliary obstruction. Cholestatic hepatitis is a mixed injury pattern that combines the hepatocellular and canalicular bile accumulation of obstructive jaundice with the portal and lobular inflammation and hepatocyte injury of hepatitis. In his classic text on druginduced liver injury (DILI)(1). Dr. Hyman Zimmerman noted the use of several terms for this pattern. including “cholangiolitic cholestasis.”“hepatocanalicular jaundice.” and “hypersensitivity cholestasis.” but cholestatic hepatitis is simpler and preferred over other terms. The cholestatic component may consist of bile accumulation in hepatocytes. bile plugs in canaliculi or both. and is most prominent in zone 3. Ductal and cholangiolar cholestasis are not typically seen in cholestatic hepatitis. The hepatitic component may resemble acute hepatitis. with a predominance of lobular inflammation. lobular disarray. and confluent necrosis. or it may resemble …,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:1taIhTC69MYC,1,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZT1niZC9OeUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA226&dq=info:bHcEK3NeougJ:scholar.google.com&ots=CO5eJ1mWLw&sig=FoOTKSmaanUkCkRYxu5aiWgUdzw,16763064611762370412,/scholar?cites=16763064611762370412,,,0

Mascitelli and colleagues1 speculate that metformin acts by reducing iron overload causing decreases in serum ferritin and improved insulin resistance. Current evidence suggests that metformin leads to improvement in insulin resistance not by altering iron metabolism but by activating the LKB1 receptor in liver leading to upregulation of AMP kinase. a master regulator of glucose metabolism. 2 There is scant evidence to suggest that metformin reduces iron absorption or hepatic iron content.

DESIGN: In one experiment. the effect of DFMO on survival of rats with TAA-induced acute hepatocellular necrosis was determined. In another experiment. blood and liver specimens were obtained from DFMO or saline-treated rats 24 h after the administration of TAA for determinations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver content of polyamines and microsomal cytochrome P-450 and for assessment of hepatic histology. METHODS: Liver polyamines were determined by reversed-phase HPLC and microsomal cytochrome P-450 content by dithionite-difference spectroscopy of CO-treated homogenates. The severity of hepatocellular necrosis was scored blindly. RESULTS: TAA-treated rats that received DFMO survived longer than saline-treated controls (P< 0.01). Serum ALT and liver putrescine concentrations were lower and the histological severity of acute hepatocellular necrosis was less in DFMO-treated rats with TAA-induced hepatocellular necrosis than in saline-treated controls (P< 0.05. P< 0.01 and P< 0.05. respectively). Total cytochrome P-450 levels were similar in DFMO and saline-treated rats with TAA-induced hepatocellular necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: DFMO increases survival in TAA-induced fulminant hepatic failure by decreasing the severity of acute hepatocellular necrosis. The beneficial effects of DFMO do not appear to be mediated by its effects on polyamine metabolism. but may be attributable to an effect of …,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC,1,https://europepmc.org/article/med/9855067,7759092519500489110,/scholar?cites=7759092519500489110,,,0

53146,CHAPTER EIGHT STEATOSIS. STEATOHEPATITIS,2020,JINPING LAI and DAVID E KLEINER,,"Practical Interpretation of Liver Biopsy, Volume 1",,328,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,Steatosis or steatohepatitis is a common liver injury pattern seen in patients. In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. steatosis and steatohepatitis can be seen in patients with obesity. diabetes. and the use of certain drugs. The cause may be idiopathic and correlation with clinical information and lab tests is important. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) share similar histologic features. but subtle changes help favor one over another. NASH is a common cause of the cryptogenic cirrhosis and features supporting a steatohepatitis etiology include identification of ballooned hepatocytes and perisinusoidal fibrosis despite the presence of only minimal steatosis. NASH-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are becoming a major indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the USA. The common development of obesity after LT leads to a high rate of NASH recurrence and 10-64% develop T2DM. Recent clinical trial results for NASH treatment are promising with reduction the severity of steatosis. ballooning and fibrosis. Steatosis or steatohepatitis can overlap with other liver diseases including viral hepatitis (Hepatis C. Hepatitis B. Epstein Barr virus (EBV)). Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). AIH overlap with PBC. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1AT). Wilson’s disease. hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) and Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The evolutionary process of tumor is driven by selecting favorable phenotypes in terms of their fitness and survival in a tumor ecosystem. While genomic alterations provide rich materials for tumor evolution. only a few can induce a recognizable phenotypic change with even fewer for a fitness advantage. Thus. transcriptomics. a major molecular feature reflecting functional activities. will be informative in modeling tumor heterogeneity and crucial in understanding tumor evolution.

Tumor cellular diversity is key factor for therapeutic failures and cancer-related mortality. This is especially relevant to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). the two major histological types of liver cancer. where various etiological factors may elicit different molecular mechanisms to initiate carcinogenesis. which lead to different molecularly distinct subtypes and complex tumor cell communities. Such heterogeneity poses a major challenge to define drivers responsible for early stage hepatocarcinogenesis and develop diagnostic tools and treatment modalities for HCC and iCCA. Characterization of tumor cell communities at the singlecell level may help shed light on the panorama of tumor biodiversity. We determined single-cell transcriptome and cellular landscape of HCC and iCCA from patients who were enrolled for immune checkpoint inhibition trials at the NIH Clinical Center. We found varying degrees of transcriptomic heterogeneity in malignant cells within and between tumors as well as diverse landscapes of tumor microenvironment (TME). We also found evidence of heterogeneity in cellular stemness. We developed methods to measure intratumoral diversity and tumor cell clonality. Strikingly. intratumoral diversity of malignant cells was associated with patient outcomes where tumors with higher diversity were associated with worse prognosis and TME reprogramming.

53190,Analysis of TP53 gene mutations demonstrates that aflatoxin is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma in Guatemala,2019,Christian Alvarez Privado and Jeremy Ortiz and Giovanna Bendfeldt-Avila and Yi Xie and Mingyi Wang and Dongjing Wu and Herbert Higson and Elisa Lee and Kedest Teshome and Joaquin Barnoya and David E Kleiner and John Groopman and Roberto Orozco and Katherine A McGlynn and Eduardo Gharzouzi and Michael Dean,,,,,,Background Guatemala has the highest incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). the dominant type of liver cancer. in the Western Hemisphere. The major risk factors in Guatemala are not wellcharacterized. but the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) appear to be low. while the prevalence of aflatoxin (AFB 1) exposure appears to be high. To examine whether AFB 1 could be a risk factor for HCC in Guatemala. this study examined the frequency of the AFB 1-signature mutation in the TP53 gene (R249S) as well as other somatic mutations. Methods Ninety-one formalin-fixed. paraffin-embedded (FFPE) HCC tissues were obtained from three hospitals in Guatemala City. An additional. eighteen tumor tissues preserved in RNAlater were also obtained. Targeted sequencing of TP53 was successfully performed in 89 of the FFPE samples. and a panel of 245 genes were sequenced in the RNAlater samples. Results Overall. 47% of HCCs had a TP53 mutation. The AFB 1-signature R249S mutation was present in 24%. Among the RNAlater samples. 44% had any TP53 mutation and 33% had the R249S mutation. Other somatic mutations were identified in known HCC driver genes such as ARID1A. ARID2. and CTNNB1.Conclusions The presence of the TP53 R249S mutation indicates that AFB 1 is a risk factor for HCC in Guatemala. The proportion of HBV positive tumors was low. suggesting that AFB 1 is associated with HCC in the absence of concomitant HBV infection. To decrease the risk of HCC in Guatemala. AFB 1 abatements efforts are warranted.,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:k8to_Y4Q4_EC,0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-7301/latest.pdf,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-7301/latest.pdf,0

Recent histological surveys of DILI provide a framework for categorizing the patterns of injury that may be seen. Pattern information can be used to distinguish DILI from other potential causes of injury. both other acute injuries as well as pre-existing injury. The pattern of injury is related to differential diagnosis and in some cases can suggest a mechanism of injury. The character and severity of the injury could potentially be used in clinical decision-making. Examples of the use of liver biopsy in the context of DILI …,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:U3qCfcK-7lkC,0,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11901-019-00486-w,,,,http://website60s.com/upload/files/4-the-role-of-liver-biopsy-in-drug-induced-liver-injury.pdf,0

The overall prevalences of HBV. HCV. HIV and syphilis infections in the first time blood donors were 13.4%. 6.9%. 2.1% and 2.4%. respectively. The highest prevalence of concurrent infection was HBV and HCV with 1.713 (1.0%) donors. Other co-infections were less common with 528 (0.3%) donors with HBV-HIV. 561 (0.3%) donors with HBV-syphilis. and 238 (0.1%) donors with HCV-HIV co-infection. Of the four centers. Fada Ngourma had the highest HBV (17.4%). and HCV (9.5%) prevalences. For all centers combined. the prevalence of HBV infection was highest in the 20-25 age group (14.1%) and lowest in the 40-60 age group (1.3%). By contrast. HCV infection was highest in the greater than 60 year age group (15.4%) and lowest in the 25-40 year age group (5.9%). Among the repeat donors. the incidence rates of HBV. HCV. HIV. and syphilis infection were 2.43. 3.06. 1.12 and 1.29 per 100 person years. respectively. suggesting that there is a significant ongoing rate of acquisition of new blood-borne infections among adults in Burkina Faso. Conclusions: Burkina Faso had high HBV and HCV infection prevalences among blood donors. The HBV prevalence was relatively high in donors aged less than 40 years old.

As a result. they may have high rates of prescription opioid use with potential for opioid misuse. However. patterns and clinical impact of prescription opioid use among patients with CHC are unknown. Methods: A national insurance database (Marketscan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Database) was used to identify commercially insured patients with CHC who sought care between January 2010 and June 2015. The first CHC ICD9 code found during this time period was used as their index date. We conducted three analyses:(1) prevalence of opioid prescriptions among patients with CHC and patterns of use.(2) evaluation of risk factors for opioid prescriptions (yes/no) in patients with CHC. and (3) clinical outcomes associated with opioid prescriptions. All patients in the analysis had active prescription coverage for a minimum of 12 months before the index date and 6 months after the index date. Opioid use was defined as having received any prescription fill for opioids. Opioid use was further classified as prior chronic (at least 120-day supply or more than 3 prescription opioids within 365 days before the index date). prior intermittent (non-chronic use before index date) or naïve (new opioid use after index date). Results: We identified of 72.613 CHC patients with a mean age of 53. 61% male (Table 1). The prevalence of opioid use during this period was 73%.

The association of sarcopenia with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is still under debate. Decreased muscle mass is associated with insulin resistance. which could provide a causal link to NAFLD. However. a direct contribution of sarcopenia towards NAFLD has yet not been reported. Aim: To determine whether muscle mass is associated with histological features of NAFLD across the spectrum of disease. independently of shared risk factors. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of adult patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Bilateral psoas muscle area was measured at L3-L4 on abdominal MRI and normalized by height to obtain the psoas muscle index (PMI). which represents skeletal muscle mass. Liver biopsies were scored using the NASH-CRN system. The association of PMI with histological scores was assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. with age. HOMA-IR. weight and gender as covariates. In a subset of 19 subjects. insulin sensitivity and glucose disposition were measured by an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and appendicular skeletal mass was measured by DEXA. Results: We studied 60 patients. 35 (58%) males. aged 45.8±13 years. 39 subjects (65%) were obese and median ALT was 61 U/L. 13 (22%) patients had advanced steatosis (grade 3). 45 (75%) patients had steatohepatitis and 2 (3%) had cirrhosis.

This is now being studied in the peripheral serum of HCV patients after direct acting antiviral therapy. The liver modulates immune responses and receives immune signals via portal vein. Portal vein evaluation may be important to understand the link between HCV induced liver disease and associated immune changes that may persist in the absence of HCV. We aim to investigate immune changes in portal and peripheral serum before and after HCV clearance. Methods: Prospectively enrolled HCV patients had a liver biopsy with portal vein cannulation (LBPVC); portal and peripheral blood was obtained both before {phase 1 (P1)} and 1 year after Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir therapy {phase 2 (P2)}. Ishak fibrosis (IF) and hepatic activity index (HAI) was used to score fibrosis and inflammation. ELISAs assessed cytokines. chemokines. macrophage and endothelial markers. Results: 23 patients had LBPVC in P1 and P2. 14 were non-cirrhotic {Ishak Fibrosis (IF) 0-4} and 9 compensated cirrhotic (IF 5-6). All achieved SVR12.

While the utility of non-invasive fibrosis markers have been demonstrated in PBC. optimal cutoffs have not been studied and non-invasive methods of identifying biliary damage need further exploration. Aims: To identify disease-specific cut-offs for cirrhosis with non-invasive fibrosis markers and to explore biomarkers that can identify significant biliary damage (> 50% bile duct loss) in PBC. Methods: Patients with PBC managed at the NIH Clinical Center from 1979-2010 were retrospectively evaluated. Pretreatment anthropometrics. laboratory and histologic data were analyzed. Bile duct loss fraction (BDLF) was calculated by [1-(# of portal areas with damaged ducts/total# of portal areas identified)] and copper was scored on a 0-3 scale. The performances of the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio (AAR). AST to platelet ratio index (APRI). and Fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) were compared to predict histological data. Results: Eightyfive predominantly female (88%) PBC patients with a mean age of 50 years (range 23-68) were evaluated. 84% were Caucasians. 5% Blacks. 5% Hispanics. and 4% Asians. Mean laboratory values (SD) included: alkaline phosphatase (ALP)= 574U/L (631). gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT)= 565U/L (414). total bilirubin (TB)= 1.53 mg/dL (2.84). platelets= 253K/µL (95). Median Ishak fibrosis score was 2 (1-3). On average. patients with Ishak≥ 3 lost 57% of their bile ducts and patients with Ishak≥ 5 lost 87%.

Interestingly. PSC occurs twice as frequently in men than women. The liver has a unique lymphocytic profile with up to 50% of total lymphocytes represented by natural killer (NK) cells. When NK cells are activated in the liver. they can cause liver injury by directly killing hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells. In addition. they release chemokines and cytokines which contribute to chronic inflammation. potentially exacerbating disease. Two classes of NK cells have been identified. residential and infiltrating NK cells. but little is currently known about their roles in hepatic immunity. In this study. we investigate gender differences in infiltrating and residential hepatic NK cells in the MDR2-/-mouse model of PSC. Methods: Hepatic mononuclear cells were isolated from the livers of eleven-week-old male and female MDR2-/-and age-and gender-matched control C57BL/6J mice. We developed a panel of antibodies to characterize both hepatic residential and infiltrating NK cells. Flow cytometry was used to analyze NK cell levels. maturation status and phenotype in our PSC model. Results: Total liver-derived NK cells were identified by the expression of NKp46/NCR1 while the expression pattern of integrins (CD49a and CD49b) on total NK cells distinguished resident and infiltrating hepatic NK cell subsets. Female MDR2-/-mice had a significantly higher proportion of residential NK cells and less infiltrating NK cells when compared to their male counterparts.

We performed whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing. copy number alterations (CNA) and mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics of 37 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and thymic carcinoma (TC) metastases obtained by rapid autopsy and found evidence of patient-specific. multi-dimensional heterogeneity. Extreme mutational heterogeneity was evident in a subset of patients whose tumors showed increased APOBEC-signature mutations and expression of APOBEC3 region transcripts compared to patients with lesser mutational heterogeneity. TP53 mutation status was associated with APOBEC hypermutators in our cohort and in three independent LUAD datasets. In a thymic carcinoma patient. extreme heterogeneity and increased APOBEC3AB expression was associated with a high-risk germline APOBEC3AB variant allele. Patients with CNA occurring late in tumor evolution had corresponding changes in gene expression and protein abundance indicating genomic instability as a mechanism of downstream transcriptomic and proteomic heterogeneity between metastases. Across all tumors. proteomic heterogeneity was greater than copy number and transcriptomic heterogeneity. Enrichment of interferon pathways was evident both in the transcriptome and proteome of the tumors enriched for APOBEC mutagenesis despite a heterogeneous immune microenvironment across metastases suggesting a role for the immune microenvironment in the expression of APOBEC transcripts and …,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:4QKQTXcH0q8C,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/301390v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/05/11/301390.full.pdf,0

HBV affects an estimated 350 million individuals globally. and it is responsible for 600.000 premature deaths annually. While the aggregate rate of HBV infection has been steadily decreasing in the United States (US). some minority groups continue to experience high infection risks. At the same time. foreign-born US residents who come from countries with high HBV prevalence are at high risk for the sequelae of chronic HBV. due to lack of virus screening and vaccination overseas. This study aims to investigate the interaction between nativity and race as predictors of HBV vaccination status through analysis of data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Methods The study sample included 30.559 adults aged 18 to 85 who participated in the 2015 NHIS. The NHIS is an annual health survey that is representative of the non-institutionalized US population. The main outcome of interest was HBV vaccination status. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for age. education. self-reported health status. region of residence. health insurance access and gender were fitted to examine the association between nativity. race and vaccination status. Adjusted logistic regression models that included a race-by-nativity cross-product term were fitted to assess the presence of interaction between race and nativity. Sampling weights were applied to yield nationally representative prevalence and effect estimates. P-values less than 0.05 were considered indicative of statistical significance.

In fact. this was the basis for the appellation offatty liver disease related to obesity in patients without significant alcohol consumption. an unfortunate “non‐” term. This may be true of steatosis and of mild forms of steatohepatitis. but pathologists have noted features that may distinguish the two. particularly in the severe form of ALD [1. 2]. These include lesions to the outflow veins described from the earliest work in ALD [3]. as well as canalicular cholestasis [4]. a lesion included in a new scoring system for alcoholic hepatitis [5]. but not a feature of NASH. In this chapter. we review the primary lesions of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases as well as features that may be unique or more common in one compared to the other. A review of the literature of comparative studies summarized conclusions of investigators that the shared lesions are often more “severe” in the severe forms of ALD [2]. Further. clinical context is essential in biopsy interpretation. Finally. grading systems for both have been published [6. 7]; the former was developed primarily for comparinglesions for clinical trials. while the latter was for prognostication for alcoholic hepatitis. The lesions utilized in these systems are a reflection of significant features. and therefore both shared and different histopathologic features of these entities can be regarded as differing histologic manifestations.

We recently developed an automated classifier that can detect and quantify macrosteatosis with greater than or equal to 95% precision and recall (sensitivity). Here. we report our early results on the classifier's performance in detecting lobular inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning. Automatic quantification of lobular inflammation and ballooning was performed on digital images of hematoxylin and eosin–stained slides of liver biopsy samples from 59 individuals with normal liver histology and varying severity of NAFLD. Two expert hepatopathologists scored liver biopsies according the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis clinical research network scoring system and provided annotations of lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning on the digital images. The classifier had precision and recall of 70% and 49% for lobular inflammation. and 91% and 54% for hepatocyte ballooning. In addition. the classifier had an area under the curve of 95% for lobular inflammation and 98% for hepatocyte ballooning. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient for comparison with pathologist grades was 45.2% for lobular inflammation and 46% for hepatocyte ballooning. Our novel observations demonstrate that automatic quantification of cardinal NAFLD histologic lesions is feasible and offer promise for further development of automatic quantification as a potential aid to pathologists evaluating NAFLD biopsies in clinical practice and clinical trials.,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:H_jBuBxbQIAC,0,https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/7538,,,,https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/7538/Vanderbeck_2015_automatic.pdf;sequence=1,0

AASLD recommends consideration of primary prophylaxis for SBP amongst patients with low ascitic fluid protein (< 1.5 g/dl) along with impaired renal function (creatinine≥ 1.2 mg/dL. blood urea≥ 25 mg/dL or serum Na≤ 130 mEq/l) or liver failure (Child score≥ 9 and bilirubin≥ 3 mg/dL. Model for end-stage disease (MELD) score is accurate in predicting 3 mo. mortality from cirrhosis and is used worldwide for listing patients for liver transplantation. However. there is no data on its predictive ability on initial SBP occurrence. We performed a retrospective case control study from two tertiary care academic centers to examine association of MELD score and risk of SBP.

Patients who are biopsied because they are suspected to have NAFLD may show a variety of histological changes which can be organized into specific and non-specific patterns of injury. In studies. the various patterns used include non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). steatosis without specific features of NASH (sometimes called “NAFLD. not NASH”) and changes. usually minimal. which do meet requirements to diagnose either NAFLD or NASH. Children may show a progressive form of NAFLD which differs from the classic adult type of NASH.

Ductopenia is the hallmark of vanishing bile duct syndrome (VBDS). which is the term used for the collection of diseases that can give rise to ductopenia (1. 2). The most common causes for VBDS are the chronic cholestatic diseases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). where VBDS may develop with progression to cirrhosis. VBDS may also be associated with hepatic sarcoidosis. graft-versus-host disease and liver transplant rejection.

53341,Drug-Induced Autoimmune Hepatitis,2011,DAVID E KLEINER,4,Liver Pathology,,223,Demos Medical Publishing,DISCUSSIONImmune-mediated drug injury may be divided into 2 basic forms. immunoallergic DILI (IA-DILI) and drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis (DIAIH)(1. 2). Patients with IA-DILI have evidence of a hypersensitivity reaction with fever. skin rash. and peripheral eosinophilia. Biopsies may show a wide range of histologies. from pure cholestasis to acute hepatitis. Autoantibodies may be present but are not required. and the clinical presentation is usually distinct from that of idiopathic AIH. In contrast. DIAIH is the term applied to drug injury that mimics idiopathic AIH. The drug injury can mimic all aspects of idiopathic disease. including clinical presentation. positive serologies for autoantibodies. elevated immunoglobulin levels. and histologic manifestations. The diagnostic criteria for AIH have been published. and there has been a recent proposal to simplify these criteria (3. 4). Both systems assign points for various disease features with certain scores qualifying as probable or definite AIH. The simplified criteria consider autoantibodies. immunoglobulin levels. and absence of viral hepatitis in the score. but a diagnosis of definite AIH requires a liver biopsy.Given that one must exclude idiopathic AIH in order to make a diagnosis of DIAIH. it is reasonable to ask how one can ever make a diagnosis of DIAIH with certainty. First. certain drugs have characteristically been associated with AIH-like presentations (Table 15.3. 1). These drugs. particularly nitrofurantoin and minocycline. have all been associated with drug injury that matches AIH. Some herbal agents. particularly germander. have also been associated with DIAIH (5).

53342,Statin-Associated Acute Hepatotoxicity,2011,DAVID E KLEINER,4,Liver Pathology,,220,Demos Medical Publishing,DISCUSSIONThe statins are a class of lipid-lowering drugs that act by inhibiting hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Their general effectiveness. safety profile. and expanding list of indications have made statins among the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide. Clinical trials of statins have reported a low (0.5–2%) incidence of ALT elevations greater than 3 times the ULN (1. 2). Although these biochemical abnormalities have caused some concern. they are generally asymptomatic and without serious consequences (3). Studies have shown that statins can be safely used in the presence of underlying liver diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (4). Of more concern are the relatively rare reports of serious hepatotoxicity. Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network investigators have recently reviewed literature evidence of serious statin hepatotoxicity (5). Statins have been reported to cause 2 major patterns of serious liver injury. The more common form is an acute cholestatic hepatitis. as demonstrated by this case. All statins currently in use have been reported to cause this injury. Patients have usually been taking the statin for several months prior to developing hepatotoxicity. but a few patients have been reported with injury only after 3 or 4 years of therapy. The biochemical pattern of injury is often hepatocellular with transaminase elevations 5 to 20 times the upper limit of normal and most cases are jaundiced as well. Biopsies show variable degrees of inflammation and intrahepatic cholestasis.

53343,Chronic Granulomatous Disease,2011,DAVID E KLEINER,4,Liver Pathology,,85,Demos Medical Publishing,DISCUSSIONChronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited immunodeficiency due to a defect in intracellular killing of pathogens by neutrophils (1–3). The incidence has been estimated to be about 1 in 200000 in the United States. It is inherited through both X-linked and autosomal recessive mechanisms. The specific functional defect is in NADPH oxidase. a membranebound enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of O2 to superoxide anion. O2. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase has 4 subunits. gp91phox. which is on the X chromosome and p22phox. p47phox and p67phox. which are on chromosomes 16. 7. and 1. respectively.

53344,Methotrexate-Induced Chronic Liver Disease,2011,DAVID E KLEINER,4,Liver Pathology,,232,Demos Medical Publishing,DISCUSSION Methotrexate was introduced in the mid-1950s as a therapy for childhood leukemias but was soon noted to ameliorate the symptoms of arthritis in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Methotrexate inhibits intracellular metabolism and purine biosynthesis by inhibiting or interfering with dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase. Hepatotoxicity of high-dose methotrexate was recognized very soon after its introduction (1). Methotrexate has been associated with a variety of pathologic changes. but the most serious toxicity is fibrosis that leads to cirrhosis. Although many of the classical studies on the pathology of methotrexate were done without pretreatment biopsies and in an era prior to the discovery of hepatitis C and the appreciation of the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH. there is a consensus that long-term therapy with methotrexate increases the risk for cirrhosis. Several risk factors have been identified. including alcohol use. obesity. and diabetes (2). Interestingly. all of these risk factors can induce liver disease that is in the differential of the pattern of injury caused by methotrexate. Weekly. rather than daily. dosing of methotrexate also reduces the risk of serious liver injury. The histologic changes observed by light microscopy are not specific for methotrexate injury and include steatosis. inflammation. nuclear enlargement and variation (anisonucleosis). and fibrosis (3–5). The steatosis is typically macrovesicular and may be mild to marked. Ballooning hepatocellular injury may be seen.

53345,15 Drug-Induced Liver Injury,2011,DAVID E KLEINER,4,Liver Pathology,,213,Demos Medical Publishing,LIVER BIOPSY AND DILI There are a number of reasons why a liver biopsy may be performed in a suspected case of DILI (8). Determination of the injury pattern can be important in implicating or excluding particular agents. Table 15.1 lists the major nonneoplastic injury patterns observed in DILI. DILI can mimic essentially all non-DILI patterns of injury. but any individual agent will have a more restricted injury profile. The first task of the pathologist is to classify the pattern (s) of injury present in the biopsy. The pattern of injury can then be compared to reported DILI patterns for the suspected agents and can also be used to focus the non-DILI differential diagnosis by eliminating diseases that do not cause that particular injury. The pattern of injury can also have implications for the mechanism of injury. For example. acute or chronic hepatitis patterns may suggest an autoimmune component. granulomas and eosinophils may suggest hypersensitivity. zonal necrosis may suggest a metabolic toxin. and microvesicular steatosis may suggest mitochondrial injury. Of equal importance to the classification of pattern is the determination of the degree of severity of the injury. Discrepancy between the degree of serum biochemical abnormalities and the severity of histological injury is common. Some types of injury. such as the distinction between necrosis and hepatitis or the evaluation of duct integrity. can only be made on biopsy. and these features may have prognostic implications. Alternatively. if the injury is mild. a needed medication may be continued. This has been the role of liver biopsy in the case of methotrexate injury. but the principle can be applied in …,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=worDZk6fSWwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA213&dq=info:8EHnmWGVzg8J:scholar.google.com&ots=4U7BNug7J4&sig=Imw2W-L8Sl3jFRbrt0dXlSaBoFg,,,,,0

53359,A Spectrum of Severe Familial Liver Disorders Associate with Telomerase,2009,RT Calado and JA Regal and DE Kleiner and DS Schrump and NR Peterson,,,,,,Background: Telomerase is an enzyme specialized in maintaining telomere lengths in highly proliferative cells. Loss-offunction mutations cause critical telomere shortening and are associated with the bone marrow failure syndromes dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anemia and with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Here. we sought to determine the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with telomerase loss-of-function mutations.Methodology/Principal Findings: Sixty-nine individuals from five unrelated families with a variety of hematologic. hepatic. and autoimmune disorders were screened for telomerase complex gene mutations; leukocyte telomere length was measured by flow fluorescence in situ hybridization in mutation carriers and some non-carriers; the effects of the identified mutations on telomerase activity were determined; and genetic and clinical data were correlated. In six generations of a large family. a loss-of-function mutation in the telomerase enzyme gene TERT associated with severe telomere shortening and a range of hematologic manifestations. from macrocytosis to acute myeloid leukemia. with severe liver diseases marked by fibrosis and inflammation. and one case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis but not with autoimmune disorders. Additionally. we identified four unrelated families in which loss-of-function TERC or TERT gene mutations tracked with marrow failure. pulmonary fibrosis. and a spectrum of liver disorders.Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that heterozygous telomerase loss-of-function mutations associate with but are not determinant of a large spectrum of hematologic and liver …,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:PklR0melJeUC,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=printable&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007926,,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=printable&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007926,0
53360,Liver Biopsy Findings in Chronic Hepatitis B,2008,David E Kleiner and Haresh Mani,,Management of Hepatitis B,,37,,The pathology of hepatitis B is diverse and reflects the clinical course of the disease. After acute infection. most subjects clear the virus. but others develop chronic hepatitis B. The natural history of chronic hepatitis B is divided into immune tolerant. immune reactive. and inactive hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier phases. Histologically. acute hepatitis B is characterized by lobular disarray. ballooning degeneration. numerous apoptotic bodies. Kupffer cell activation. and lymphocyte-predominant lobular and portal inflammation. Significant lobular necrosis leads to fulminant hepatic failure. Although patients with acute hepatitis B usually do not have biopsies. a similar pattern of injury may also be seen in patients with chronic hepatitis B with acute disease flares. superinfection with hepatitis D. or a second hepatic insult (such as by drugs). In addition. the virus may develop a precore mutation. leading to a hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic and often relapsing hepatitis. In chronic hepatitis B infection. the pattern of injury is characterized predominantly by lymphocytic portal inflammation with interface hepatitis. associated with spotty lobular inflammation and portal-based fibrosis. similar to the pattern of injury in other causes of chronic hepatitis. Inflammation is minimal in the immune tolerant and inactive carrier phases. but inflammation is prominent in the immune reactive phase. Unlike chronic hepatitis C. chronic hepatitis B is usually not associated with lymphoid aggregates. duct (Poulsen) lesions. or steatosis. Ground glass hepatocytes may be seen and immunostains—hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg …,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.975.1250&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=47,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.975.1250&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=47,0

By comparing microarray data from a model of renal regeneration and repair (RRR) with reported gene expression in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). we asked whether those two processes do. in fact. share molecular features and regulatory mechanisms. The majority (77%) of the genes expressed in RRR and RCC were concordantly regulated. whereas only 23% were discordant (i.e.. changed in opposite directions). The orchestrated processes of regeneration. involving cell proliferation and immune response. were reflected in the concordant genes.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Candidate genes. including  myxovirus resistance-1 (Mx1). protein kinase (PKR). transforming growth factor- Β 1 (TGF-Β). interleukin-10 (IL-10). and interferon-gamma (IFN-Γ).  were evaluated for associations with liver fibrosis in 374 treatment-naive patients with genotype-1 chronic HCV infection [194 Caucasian Americans (CAs) and 180 African Americans (AAs)]. using a genetic haplotype approach. Among the 18 haplotypes that occurred with a frequency ≥5% in the cohort overall. the  Mx1-(-123C)-(+6886A)-(+19820G(379V))-(+38645T)  (abbreviated  Mx1-CAGT).  and  PKR-(+110T)-(+7949G)-(+13846A)-(+22937T)-(+40342T)  (abbreviated  PKR-TGATT)  haplotypes were independently associated with less severe hepatic fibrosis (Ishak ≥ 3 versus <3). These associations persisted after adjustment for potential confounders such as alcohol use. sex. age (which is strongly correlated with the estimated duration of HCV infection [Spearman's correlation coefficient ( r  s ) = 0.6)]. and race (for  Mx1-CAGT : OR = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.16-0.68;  P  = 0.0027; and for  PKR-TGATT : OR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.32-0.98;  P  = 0.0405).

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Hepatic steatosis is common in chronic hepatitis C and has been linked to concurrent obesity. insulin resistance. diabetes. disease severity. and poor response to therapy. Racial differences in rates of obesity and diabetes may contribute to racial differences in hepatic steatosis and treatment response. The aim of the present study was to compare hepatic steatosis and its associations between African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) patients with chronic hepatitis C. genotype 1. participating in a prospective study of peginterferon and ribavirin therapy. Liver biopsy results were available from 194 AA patients and 205 CA patients. The 2 groups were compared for anthropometric. clinical. and biochemical features and insulin resistance estimated by the homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA-IR). Sixty-one percent of the AA patients and 65% of the CA patients had hepatic steatosis ( P  = 0.38). In univariable analysis. steatosis was associated with HOMA-IR. body mass index. waist circumference. serum triglycerides. aminotransferase level. and histological scores for inflammation and fibrosis. After adjusting for these features. AA patients had a lower risk of steatosis than did CA patients (OR 0.54. 95% CI 0.32-0.91.  P  = 0.02). Insulin resistance but not steatosis was associated with a lower rate of sustained virological response when adjusted for known factors that predict response (relative risk 0.87. 95% CI 0.77-0.99.

This could implicate a superinfection with a hepatotrophic virus on pre-existing HCV infection. despite the lack of laboratory markers.

The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases family. including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2). regulates the activity of these multifunctional metalloproteinases. TIMP family members are proteinase inhibitors that contain six conserved disulfide bonds. one involving an amino-terminal cysteine residue that is critical for MMP inhibitor activity. TIMP-2 has been expressed in Escherichia coli. folded from insoluble protein. and functionally characterized. The wild type protein inhibited gelatinase A (MMP-2). whereas a variant with an alanine appended to the amino terminus (Ala+TIMP-2) was inactive. Removal of amino-terminal alanine by exopeptidase digestion restored protease inhibitor activity.

Virol,4,3317,,MATERIALS AND METHODSChimpanzees. Chimpanzees Ch1535 and Ch1536 were inoculated with fulllength uncapped RNA transcripts by direct intrahepatic injection (33). The cDNA clone had been assembled by using early-acute-phase plasma. designated H77. obtained in 1977 from patient H (46). Both Ch1535 and Ch1536 were seronegative for all known hepatitis viruses. were negative for HCV RNA. and had normal liver enzyme levels (33) prior to inoculation. Serum was collected from these animals at weekly intervals until week 22 postinoculation (pi). after which samples were collected monthly. Liver biopsy specimens were collected for RNA extraction and histological analysis at weekly intervals until week 17 and then four times over the next 8 months. The biopsy specimens were formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin before being sectioned and were evaluated semiquantitatively for inffammatory features on a scale from 0 to 4 (representing none. minimal. mild. moderate. and marked). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected at weeks 46 and 51 for RNA extraction. Preparation of PBMCs.

Prenylation is essential for HDV particle assembly. and prenylation inhibitors abrogate HDV production in experimental models. In a proof-of-concept study. we evaluated the antiviral effects and safety of the prenylation inhibitor. lonafarnib (LNF). in patients with chronic HDV.Methods: In this phase 2a double-blinded. randomized. placebo-controlled study. two groups of patients with chronic HDV were enrolled. Subjects received LNF 100 mg (Group 1) or LNF 200 mg (Group 2) twice daily for 28 days followed by 6 months of follow-up. Both groups enrolled 6 treatment and 2 placebo subjects. Serial measurements of safety parameters. liver tests. pharmacokinetics. and virologic markers were obtained for analysis and mathematical modeling.Results: Patients were 71% male. median age of 38. and included Asian (50%). Caucasian (43%) and African (7%) without significant differences in baseline parameters between groups. At day 28. compared to placebo. mean log HDV RNA declines from baseline were-0.73 log IU/mL in Group 1 (p= 0.04) and-1.54 log IU/mL in Group 2 (p= 0.002). LNF serum concentrations correlated with HDV RNA change (r2= 0.78. p< 0.0001). Model fits indicate that while HBsAg remained stable. after a short pharmacological delay (0.75 [standard error. se= 0.24] days) LNF effectiveness in blocking HDV production was significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 (0.952 [se= 0.06] vs. 0.739 [se= 0.05]. p< 0.001) and that HDV half-life in serum was 1.62 [se= 0.07] days.,True,jYvKT9gAAAAJ:QeguYG95ZbAC,0,https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info%3Alanl-repo%2Flareport%2FLA-UR-15-21503,,,,https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info%3Alanl-repo%2Flareport%2FLA-UR-15-21503,0

53473,71 MEDIUM TERM TREATMENT OF PBC WITH METHOTREXATE (MTX) DOES NOT INCREASE HEPATIC DNA DAMAGE.,,DE Kleiner and R Sallie M Wells and JH Ho0fnanle,,,,,,Liver Diseases Section 1. NIDDK. and Laboratory of Extracellular Pathology 2. NCI. NIH. Bethesda. MD. 20892. Background: Methotrexate is widely used in the treatment of psoriasis as well as other inflammatory conditions. Hepatotoxicity. including the development of cirrhosis. is a major long-term complication but the mechanism (s) of this injury are unknown. MTX therapy induces DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes after short term exposure. but the effect on hepatic DNA is unknown. We examined the extent of DNA damage in PBC patients treated with MTX by in-tim lahelling. Methods: Serial liver biopsies obtained from 25 methotrexate treated patients with biopsy proven PBC were studied by labelling of damaged DNA by both terminal transferase end-lahelling and by in-situ nick translation. Labelling was quantitated by phosphorimager measurement of radioactivity and examined qualitatively by immunochemistry of biotin 1ahelled sections. The histological activity index (HAD was determined. Results: Measurement of DNA labelling indices. assessed by repeated assays of the same sections. was highly reproducible (r--0.8. p< 0.001). Quantitative in-situ analysis of DNA damage did not correlate with MTX dose. duration or response to treatment or with Mayo risk score and no differences in labelling indices were seen in individual patients after treatment (1005+ 715) compared to pre-treatment biopsies (943.+ _565. p= 0.75). There was no correlation between in-situ DNA labelling indices and HA/score (r--0.06. p= 0.8). nor with periportal inflammation (r= 0.3. p--0.19) or other individual components of the HAI.
