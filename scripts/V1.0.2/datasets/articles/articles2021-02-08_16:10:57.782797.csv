In this study. we found that substitution of a highly conserved tryptophan at position 1246 with cysteine (W1246C-MRP1) in the putative last transmembrane segment (TM17) of MRP1 eliminated 17β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (E217βG) transport by membrane vesicles prepared from transiently transfected human embryonic kidney cells while leaving the capacity for leukotriene C4- and verapamil-stimulated glutathione transport intact.

Studies with MRP-enriched membrane vesicles have demonstrated that the protein can bind and transport cysteinyl leukotrienes. as well as some other gluta-thione conjugates. with high affinity. In contrast. there is no direct evidence of the ability of MRP to bind or transport unmodified forms of the drugs to which it confers resistance. To facilitate studies of the physiological function (s) of MRP and its ability to cause multidrug resistance in vivo. we cloned and characterized the mRNA specifying its murine homolog. The murine MRP mRNA encodes a protein of 1528 amino acids that is 88% identical to human MRP. Although detectable by North-em blotting at variable levels in a wide range of tissues. in situ hybridization experiments revealed that MRP mRNA expres-sion in some tissues is cell-type specific. High levels of the mRNA were detected in epithelia lining bronchi and bronchioles. as well as stage-specific expression in the seminiferous epithelium of the testes. Comparison of the predicted hydrop-athy profiles of human and murine MRP suggests a highly conserved membrane topology. the most distinctive feature of which is an extremely hydrophobic NH2-terminal region contaming five or six potential transmembrane sequences.

A region corresponding to bp 3897-4471 of MRP cDNA is amplified. which encompasses approximately half of the second nucleotide-binding domain (NBD2). In two multidrug resistant (MDR) sublines of the HL-60 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line which overexpress MRP but not P-glycoprotein. the assay detects elevated levels of MRP mRNA (4-to 8-fold) relative to the drug-sensitive parental cells (designated HL-60/W). Blast cells from 24 patients with AML were also studied for MRP expression using this RT-PCR method. Expression of MRP was normalized for that of beta-actin in the blast cells. which was also determined by RT-PCR. All of these blast cell samples had MRP expression that was detectable after 35 PCR cycles. Eighteen of these patients samples had levels of expression of MRP mRNA equal to or less than that expressed by HL-60/W cells.

We tested the hypothesis that the protective effect of α-crystallin is mediated by changes in cellular glutathione (GSH) and elucidated the mechanism of GSH efflux. In α-crystallin overexpressing cells resistant to cell death. cellular GSH was >2 fold higher than vector control cells and this increase was seen particularly in mitochondria. The high GSH levels associated with α-crystallin overexpression were due to increased GSH biosynthesis. On the other hand. cellular GSH was decreased by 50% in murine retina lacking αA or αB crystallin. Multiple multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family isoforms were expressed in RPE. among which MRP1 was the most abundant. MRP1 was localized to the plasma membrane and inhibition of MRP1 markedly decreased GSH efflux. MRP1-suppressed cells were resistant to cell death and contained elevated intracellular GSH and GSSG. Increased GSH in MRP1-supressed cells resulted from a higher conversion of GSSG to GSH by glutathione reductase. In contrast. GSH efflux was significantly higher in MRP1 overexpressing RPE cells which also contained lower levels of cellular GSH and GSSG. Oxidative stress further increased GSH efflux with a decrease in cellular GSH and rendered cells apoptosis-prone. In conclusion. our data reveal for the first time that 1) MRP1 mediates GSH and GSSG efflux in RPE cells; 2) MRP1 inhibition renders RPE cells resistant to oxidative stress-induced cell death while MRP1 overexpression makes them susceptible and 3) the antiapoptotic …,True,IpzUezMAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC,52,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033420,10769758212967139592,/scholar?cites=10769758212967139592,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033420,0,0,0

A Mab (1-7-1) specific for an epitope common to rat cytochromes P-450c (P4501A1) and P-450d (P4501A2) detected the corresponding munne species (P1-450/P3-450) in cells of the alveolar septa. including type II cells. as well as endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Cytochrome P1-450 (Mabs 1-31-2. 1-36-1) is localized in type II cells of the alveolar septa but is not found in endothelialcells. Patterns of immunoreactivity with the 3-MC-specific Mabs indicate that alveolar septal cells possess P1-450 and P3-450. whereas endothelial cells of the vasculature are not the sites of P1-450. but rather of P3-450.

Its transport mechanism is multifaceted. especially with respect to the participation of GSH.

Thus. the interactions between GSH and MRP1 are mechanistically complex.

Human MRP1 transports a wide range of natural product drugs and structurally diverse conjugated and unconjugated organic anions. Its closest relative is MRP3.

It is noteworthy that MRP1 transports glutathione (GSH) and GSH conjugates and displays GSH-stimulated transport of a number of unconjugated and conjugated compounds. In contrast. MRP3 does not transport GSH and is a poor transporter of GSH conjugates. However. both proteins transport glucuronide conjugates. such as 17β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide).

However. topoisomerase II is cytoplasmic under certain circumstances. indicating that it may undergo active nuclear export. We have examined the ability of Leu-rich potential nuclear export signal (NES) sequences present in human topoisomerase IIα and β to direct the export of a green fluorescent protein–glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein following microinjection into HeLa cell nuclei. Of 12 sequences tested. only one potential NES sequence from the comparable location in each isoform (αNES1018–1028 and βNES1034–1044) was active.

Glu521. and Glu535 markedly reduced MRP1 levels. Because three of these residues are predicted to lie at the interface of CL5 and the second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2). a critical role is indicated for this region in the plasma membrane expression of MRP1.

At diagnosis. many tumour cellsappear to be intrinsically more responsive to chemotherapeutic agents than normal cells; however. upon clinical relapse. acquired drug resistance appears limited to the tumour cells. This problem in clinical oncology is difficult to study experimentally because many multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines developed in vitro prove to benon-tumourigenic in athymic mice and to have a differentiated or'normalized'phenotype (Biedler & Peterson. 1981; Remy et al.. 1984).

INC,The refinement of combination chemotherapy over the past two decades has significantly increased the median survival time of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC)(1). However. acquired resistance to multiple drugs is a major obstacle to successful treatment. and despite improvements in survival. chemotherapy is responsible for the cure of less than 10% of patients.

The first successful attempts at achieving this involved the immortalization of human B lymphocytes with Ep-stein-Barr virus (EBV). Epstein-Barr virus is a B-lymphotropic herpes virus that causes polyclonal activation and immortalization of antibody-producing human B cells (1). Steinitz et al.(2) were the first to recognize that this capability could be used to establish permanent cell lines to produce human antibodies of predetermined specificity. By using lymphocytes from subjects with high natural anti-body titers to the synthetic hapten NNP (4-hydroxy-3. 5-dinitrophenacetic acid). they preselected antigen-binding lymphocytes and then established permanent lines by infection with EBV. Others (3-18) subsequently applied this technique to produce antibodies that react with a variety of specific antigens. It soon became apparent that there were major limitations with the EBV method. Although specific antibodies could be produced. the levels of immuno-globulin production were low (< 1 ug/ml). and antibody production declined rapidly with time (3). Furthermore. the lines were very difficult to clone (19).

Multidrug Resistance Protein (MRP) 2 (ABCC2) belongs to subfamily C of the ABC superfamily and when overexpressed in tumour cells. confers resistance to a wide variety of anticancer chemotherapeutic agents. MRP2 is also an active transporter of organic anions such as methotrexate (MTX). estradiol glucuronide (E217βG) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4). and is located on the apical membrane of polarized cells including hepatocytes where it acts as a biliary transporter. We recently identified a highly conserved tryptophan residue in the related MRP1 that is critical for the substrate specificity of this protein. In the present study. we have examined the effect of replacing the analogous tryptophan residue at position 1254 of MRP2. We found that only non-conservative substitutions (Ala. Cys) of Trp 1254 eliminated [3 H] E217βG transport by MRP2. while more conservative substitutions (Phe. Tyr) had no effect. In addition. only the most conservatively substituted mutant (W1254Y) transported [ 3 H] LTC4. while all other substitutions eliminated transport of this substrate. On the other hand. all substitutions of Trp 1254 eliminated transport of [3 H] MTX. Finally. we found that sulfinpyrazone stimulated [ 3 H] E217βG transport by wild-type MRP2 4-fold. while transport by the Trp 1254 substituted mutants was enhanced 6-to 10-fold.

In many instances. drug resistance is observed to multiple agents which differ in structure as well as in their mechanism of action. Development of such multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle in the treatment of a variety of malignancies (Kaye. 1988). Although the altered expression of a number of pro-teins has been associated with MDR in different model systems. the overexpression of a 150-180 kDa glycoprotein has been the most consistent. This glycoprotein. termed P-glycoprotein. acts as an energy dependent efflux pump to reduce drug accumulation within the cell (Gerlach et al.. 1986a). While overexpression of P-glycoprotein is clearly re-sponsible for MDR in some cell systems. it is unlikely that P-glycoprotein by itself can account for the …,True,IpzUezMAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC,6,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1971722/,11330243938764118762,/scholar?cites=11330243938764118762,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1971722/pdf/brjcancer00215-0022.pdf,0,0,0

Arsenic is a Group 1 (proven) human carcinogen which causes skin. lung. and bladder tumors. and is associated with numerous other adverse health effects. including neuropathy and cardiovascular dysfunctions. Multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs/ABCCs) mediate the cellular efflux of a chemically diverse array of endogenous and xenobiotic metabolites. Substrates include glutathione (GSH) conjugates of inorganic and methylated arsenic species and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV).

The present study tested the ATP-dependent vesicular transport of leukotriene C4 and 17β-estradiol 17-(β-D-glucuronide)(E217βG) mediated by the MRP1 and MRP2 transporters in the presence of six potential modulators from three different classes of GSH-conjugated catechol metabolites: the ecstasy metabolite 5-(glutathion-S-yl)-N-methyl-α-methyldopamine (5-GS-N-Me-α-MeDA); the caffeic acid metabolite 2-(glutathion-S-yl)-caffeic acid (2-GS-CA); and four GSH conjugates of 2-OH and 4-OH estrogens (GS-estrogens). MRP1-mediated E217βG transport was inhibited in a competitive manner with a relative order of potency of GS-estrogens (IC50< 1 µM)> 2-GS-CA (IC50 3 µM)> 5-GS-N-Me-α-MeDA (IC50 31 µM). MRP2-mediated transport was inhibited with a similar order of potency. except the 2-OH-4-GS-estradiol and 4-OH-2-GS-estradiol conjugates were approximately 50-and 300-fold less potent. respectively. Transport activity was unaffected by N-acetylcysteine conjugates of N-Me-α-MeDA and CA. The position of GSH conjugation appears important since all four GS-estrogen conjugates tested were potent inhibitors of MRP1 transport. but only the 2-OH-1-GS-estradiol and 2-OH-1-GS-estrone conjugates were potent inhibitors of MRP2-mediated transport.

There are two isoforms of topo II (a and b) that have limited functional redundancy. although their catalytic mechanisms appear the same. Using their COOH-terminal domains (CTDs) in yeast two-hybrid analysis. we have identified phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) as a binding partner of both topo II a and b. Although predominantly a plasma membrane protein involved in phosphatidylserine externalization. PLSCR1 can also be imported into the nucleus where it may have a tumour suppressor function. The interactions of PLSCR1 and topo II were confirmed by pull-down assays with topo II a and b CTD fusion proteins and endogenous PLSCR1. and by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous PLSCR1 and topo II a and b from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. PLSCR1 also increased the decatenation activity of human topo IIa. A conserved basic sequence in the CTD of topo IIa was identified as being essential for binding to PLSCR1 and binding of the two proteins could be inhibited by a synthetic peptide corresponding to topo IIa amino acids 1430-1441.

Cells that survive this type of selection are often resistant to a wide variety of structurally and functionally unrelated. natural product drugs. in addition to the original selecting agent. In general. they also display an enhanced ability to efflux the drugs to which they are resistant and resistance can be reversed by verapamil and other membrane active agents that restore drug accumulation by inhibiting Pgp-mediated drug efflux (Ambudkar et al.. 1999; Deeley and Cole. 1997).

We have now assessed the functional importance of all polar and charged amino acids in this TM helix. Asn1100. Ser1097. and Lys1092. which are all predicted to be on the same face of the helix as to Glu1089. are involved in determining the substrate specificity of the protein. Notably. elimination of the positively charged side chain of Lys1092. increased resistance to the cationic drugs vincristine and doxorubicin. but not the electroneutral drug etoposide (VP-16).

In contrast. mutations of Asp1084 that eliminate the carboxylate side chain markedly decreased resistance to all drugs tested. as well as transport of both E217ßG and LTC4. despite the fact that LTC4 binding was unaffected.

MRP1. is a clinically important ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter in which the three membrane spanning domains (MSD). which contain up to 17 transmembrane (TM) helices. and two nucleotide binding domains (NBD) are configured MSD1-MSD2-NBD1-MSD3-NBD2. In tumor cells. MRP1 confers resistance to a broad spectrum of drugs. but in normal cells. it functions as a primary active transporter of organic anions such as leukotriene C4 (LTC4). and 17β-estradiol 17β-(D-glucuronide)(E217βG). We have previously shown that mutation of TM17-Trp1246 eliminates E217βG transport and drug resistance conferred by MRP1 while leaving LTC4 transport intact. By mutating the eleven remaining Trp residues that are in predicted TM segments of MRP1. we have now determined that five of them are also major determinants of MRP1 function. Ala substitution of three of these residues. Trp445 (TM8). Trp553 (TM10) and Trp1198 (TM16). eliminated or substantially reduced transport levels of five organic anion substrates of MRP1.

Md.: Waverly Press,The Mr 190.000 multidrug resistance (MRP) confers resistance to a broad spectrum of natural. product drugs. However. it has not been possible to demonstrate that MRP can actively transport unmodified forms of these compounds. although the protein has been shown to transport structurally diverse glutathione (GSH)- and glucuronide-conjugated molecules. Previously. we showed that ATP-dependent uptake of vincristine by MRP-enriched. inside-out membrane vesicles could be stimulated by physiological concentrations of GSH (Loe et al.. J. Biol. Chem. 271: 9675-9687. 1996). We have-now established that the ATP/GSH dependent vincristine uptake is both proportional to the level of MRP in the membrane vesicles and can be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies shown previously to inhibit transport of established MRP substrates. such as leukotriene C4. We also show that short-chain alkyl derivatives of GSH …,True,IpzUezMAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11114116247868261291&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Using the Kaplan-Meier method. the log-rank test and the cox-regression model. we analysed the relation of IL-2 secretion in whole blood cell cultures from 52 patients with SCLC at the time of diagnosis to established prognostic factors relevant for survival in SCLC.Impairment of IL-2 secretion significantly influences survival In SCLC (p= 0.004). Further univariate and multivariate analysis showed that thus prognostic factor is independent from other factors of prognostic relevance rn SCLC. namely stage of disease. Neurone specific enolase (NSE). Lactate dehydrogenase(LDH). age. and sex. More important. the prognostic value of IL-2 secretion is comparable to the most predominant prognostic factors for survival in SCLC identified so far. In the final model of the cox regression analysis. the p-value for IL-2 secretion in relation to stage of disease was 0.012 and 0.019. respectively. In addition. the level of IL-2 predicts for response to chemotherapy(p= 0.037).

Levels of immunoreactive topoisomerase IIα are also reduced in H69AR cells.  In the present study. we found that cleaved complex formation in the presence of VP-16 was decreased in H69AR cells as compared with H69 cells.  In addition. the resistant cells contained lower levels of both topoisomerase IIα and topoisomerase IIβ protein and mRNA.  However. these changes were not accompanied by a decrease in the P4-unknotting (strand-passing) activity of 0.67 M NaCl nuclear extracts of H69AR cells. nor was there any difference in VP-16 inhibition of unknotting activity in the H69 and H69AR nuclear extracts.

Steinitz et al.(2) were the first to recognize that this capability could be used to establish permanent cell lines to produce human antibodies of prede-termined specificity. By using lymphocytes from subjects with high natural antibody titers to the synthetic hapten NNP (4-hydroxy-3. 5-dinitrophenacetic acid). they preselected antigen-binding lymphocytes and then established permanent lines by infection with EBV. Others (3-18) subsequently applied this technique to produce antibodies that react with a variety of specific antigens. It soon became apparent that there were major limitations with the EBV method. Although specific antibodies could be produced. the levels of immuno-globulin production were low (< 1 ug/ml). and antibody production declined rapidly with time (3). Furthermore. the lines were very difficult to clone (19).

The access of circulating anti-sperm antibodies to the genital tract is not self-evident. but antibodies do affect the normal sperm/cervical mucus interaction (Bronson Ct d.. 1984; Parslow ct ul.. 1985). and a correlation exists between reduced fertility and auto-immunity to sperm (Ayvaliotis c't ul.. 1985).

In addition to two membrane spanning domains (MSDs) typical of most ABC transporters. MRP1 has a third MSD (MSD0) of unknown function. Unlike some topologically similar ABCC proteins. removal of MSD0 has minimal effect on function. nor does it prevent MRP1 from trafficking to basolateral membranes in polarized cells. However. we find that independent of cell type. the truncated protein accumulates in early/recycling endosomes. Using a real-time internalization assay. we demonstrate that MSD0 is important for MRP1 retention in. or recycling to. the plasma membrane. We also show that MSD0 traffics independently to the cell surface and promotes membrane localization of the core-region of MRP1 when the two protein fragments are coexpressed.

In nonmetastatic primarily enucleated RBs. we show expression ofpl7O in 3 of 18 samples and expression of multidrug resistance protein (MRP). the second protein associated with resistance to chemotherapy. in 1 of 18 samples. All three RBs that failed chemotherapy without cyclosporine expressed MRP with p170. All three RBs that were enucleated immediately when chemotherapy failed despite the addition of cyclosporine expressed only MRP. One RB enucleated 2years after failing chemotherapy with cyclosporine. despite radiation and salvage chemo therapy. expressed both p170 and MRP. Two metastatic RBs that ex pressed both p170 and MRP at diagnosis and at recurrence failed chem otherapy without cyclosporine. whereas one metastatic RB that expressed neither protein was cured by chemotherapy without cyclosporine. MRP may result in failure of chemotherapy despite the elimination of p170-expressing clones by cyclosporine.,True,IpzUezMAAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3199810488965741049&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

It acts as a cleansing solution. an ion reservoir. a lubricant and a buffer. In addition to its other host‐protective properties. saliva could constitute a first line of defence against free radical‐mediated oxidative stress. since the process of mastication and digestion of ingested foods promotes a variety of reactions. including lipid peroxidation. Moreover. during gingival inflammation. gingival crevicular fluid flow increases the change of saliva composition with products from the inflammatory response; this. in turn. could have some rôle in controlling and/or modulating oxidative damages in the oral cavity.

Internetscale applications. To meet their needs. these stores often sacrifice consistency for availability. Yet. few tools exist that can verify the consistency actually provided by a key-value store. and quantify the violations if any. How can a user check if a storage system meets its promise of consistency? If a system only promises eventual consistency. how bad is it really? In this paper. we present efficient algorithms that help answer these questions. By analyzing the trace of interactions between the client machines and a key-value store. the algorithms can report whether the trace is safe. regular. or atomic. and if not. how many violations there are in the trace. We run these algorithms on traces of our eventually consistent keyvalue store called Pahoehoe and find few or no violations. thus showing that it often behaves like a strongly consistent system during our tests.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:c_xDhezhKKUC,124,https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotdep10/tech/full_papers/Anderson.pdf,1982725106058679511,/scholar?cites=1982725106058679511,,https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotdep10/tech/full_papers/Anderson.pdf,0,0,0

Autophagy provides a mechanism for the turnover of cellular organelles and proteins through a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway. The aim of this research was to study the role of autophagy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with periodontitis and gingival fibroblasts treated with a lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Autophagy-dependent mechanisms have been proposed in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders and in other diseases related to periodontitis. such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Thus it is important to study the role of autophagy in the pathophysiology of periodontitis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with periodontitis (n = 38) and without periodontitis (n = 20) were used to study autophagy. To investigate the mechanism of autophagy. we evaluated the influence of a lipopolysaccharide from P. gingivalis in human gingival fibroblasts. and autophagy was monitored morphologically and biochemically. Autophagosomes were observed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We found increased levels of autophagy gene expression and high levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with periodontitis compared with controls. A significantly positive correlation between both was observed. In human gingival fibroblasts treated with lipopolysaccharide from P. gingivalis. there was an increase of protein and transcript of autophagy-related protein 12 (ATG12) and microtubule …,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC,99,https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-122,12622468061104575753,/scholar?cites=12622468061104575753,,https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-122,0,0,0

91525,Improved FIA-ABTS method for antioxidant capacity determination in different biological samples.,2004,Stefano Bompadre and Luciana Leone and Alessia Politi and Maurizio Battino,38,Free Radical Research,8,831-838,,In order to evaluate the actual antioxidant features of foods. beverages and also plasma from patients. a number of assays have been developed in the last few years to determine the so called total antioxidant activity (TAA). intended as the cumulative capacity of a biological sample to scavenge free radicals. Most of the assays partially failed in obtaining a good reproducibility when using plasma because it is composed of a large number of substances. some of which are present at very high concentrations and possess masking features. For these reasons we have improved the widely known ABTS method by means of a FIA system where both temperature and dispersion of sample and reagent were strictly controlled. We found that temperature may be a critical aspect in the measurement of plasma TAA whilst its influence may be less important in the assay of non-complex biological samples. We demonstrated that also the reaction time may be critical. depending on the nature of the substance employed. Data confirmed the high TAA of a methylsalicylate-containing mouthrinse as well as the negligible TAA offered by the chlorhexidine containing one. White wines (Verdicchio) also displayed interesting TAA values. The improved method was useful to screen rapidly. without dilution. with very limited handling of the sample and with high repeatability the TAA of plasma in addition to chemical products. beverages and non-complex biological mixtures.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,81,https://europepmc.org/article/med/15493456,9635702955920565080,/scholar?cites=9635702955920565080,,,0,0,0

Although the different diet fats used did not produce any effect on microsomes. it was possible to show that each experimental diet differently influenced the mitochondrial levels of CoQ9 and CoQ10. The highest mitochondrial CoQ content was found in case of a diet supplemented with corn oil. An endogenous oxidative stress induced by adriamycin was able to produce a sharp decrease in mitochondrial CoQ9 levels in the rats to which corn oil was administered.

Indeed. if nutritional components are also combined with a high standard of sensorial fruit quality. the perspective for consumer health can be further improved by encouraging more fruit consumption. Wild species are valued by strawberry breeders as sources of novel traits. especially for pest resistance and abiotic stress tolerance. Furthermore. previous investigations have shown improvements in fruit nutritional quality in breeding material that originated from Fragaria virginiana ssp. glauca (FVG) inter-species crosses. Recently. commercial varieties of strawberries have also shown interesting variability in fruit nutritional quality.   Results Strawberry fruit sensorial and nutritional qualities generated by Fragaria inter-species and intra-species crosses were evaluated on 78 offspring derived from 8 families: two that originated from F. × ananassa intra-species crossing; three from back-crossing of F1– FVG × F. × ananassa; and three from back-crossing of BC1– FVG × F. × ananassa. The genetic variability from the three types of cross combinations was analyzed by calculation of the correlations among the fruit sensorial and nutritional parameters. The results obtained show that two subsequent back-crossing generations from an inter-species crossing combination with F. virginiana ssp. glauca provides useful improvement of the fruit nutritional and sensorial qualities that is combined with agronomic standards that are close to those requested at the commercial level.

Information is reported in terms of guest-host mutual orientation and localization. The overall orientational anisotropy of guest ubiquinone molecules is described by a basic set of limiting orientation/localization modes. Assignments of the UV transitions of the ubiquinone chromophore were obtained by the liquid crystal-linear dichroism technique and molecular orbital (CNDO/S) calculations.

The CoQ concentration in mitochondria from different tissues was investigated by HPLC. By analyzing the rates of electron transfer as a function of total CoQ concentration. it was calculated that. at physiological CoQ concentration NADH cytochrome c reductase activity is not saturated. Values for theoretical Vmax could not be reached experimentally for NADH oxidation. because of the limited mis-cibility of CoQ10 with the phospholipids. On the other hand. it was found that CoQ3 could stimulate α-glycerophosphate cytochrome c reductase over three-fold. Electron transfer being a diffusion-coupled process. we have investigated the possibility of its being subjected to diffusion control.

The possibility to recognize alterations in the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation in pathological states and to improve this efficiency in order to correct diseases requires knowledge of the mechanisms controlling the rate of ATP synthesis. This task is hampered by uncertainties still existing on the organization and mechanism of the enzymes carrying out oxidative phosphorylation. The authors have collected experimental evidence that coenzyme Q concentration in the mitochondrial membrane phospholipids in physiologically not saturating for maximal electron-transfer rate: in fact the Km of the redox enzymic complexes. using the oxidized and reduced form of coenzyme Q. for these substrates. are in the range of their concentrations in the membrane. The addition of exogenous coenzyme Q enhances the respiratory turnover above the physiological rate but without reaching theoretical Vmax. owing to the limited miscibility of ubiquinones with the membrane phospholipids. On the contrary. a decrease of ubiquinone content in the membrane lowers electron-transfer activity in a reversible fashion. Taking account that the rate of lateral coenzyme Q diffusion in the membrane does not appear to control electron transfer. it is suggested that only ubiquinone concentration affects the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. with interesting pathological and pharmacological implications.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,60,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2276890,11556778949831130074,/scholar?cites=11556778949831130074,,,0,0,0

Antimycin A and myxothiazol inhibit glycerol-3-phosphate cytochromec oxidoreductase in a sigmoidal fashion. indicating that CoQ behaves as a homogeneous pool between glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and complex III. The inhibition of ubiquinol cytochromec reductase is linear at low concentrations of both inhibitors. indicating that sigmoidicity of antimycin A and myxothiazol inhibition is not a direct property of antimycin A and myxothiazol binding. Glycerol-3-phosphate cytochromec oxidoreductase is strongly stimulated by added CoQ3. indicating that endogenous CoQ is not saturating. Application of the pool equation for nonsaturating ubiquinone allows calculation of theK m for endogenous CoQ of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of 3.14mM.

The aim of the present study was to examine the phytochemical content and the antioxidant activity of Strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) honey (STH) and its cytotoxic properties against human colon adenocarcinoma (HCT-116) and metastatic (LoVo) cell lines in comparison with Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey (MH). Several unifloral STH and MH were analyzed for their phenolic. flavonoid. amino acid and protein contents. as well as their radical scavenging activities. STH from the Berchidda area showed the highest amount of phenolic. flavonoid. amino acid and protein content. and antioxidant capacity compared to MH. Both STH and MH induced cytotoxicity and cell death in a dose-and time-dependent manner in HCT-116 and LoVo cells. with less toxicity on non-cancer cells. Compared to MH. STH showed more effect at lower concentrations on HCT-116 and LoVo cells. In addition. both honeys increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In HCT-116 cells. STH and MH induced similar ROS production but in LoVo cells STH induced a higher percentage of ROS compared to MH. Our results indicate that STH and MH can induce cell growth inhibition and ROS generation in colon adenocarcinoma and metastatic cells. which could be due to the presence of phytochemicals with antioxidant properties. These preliminary results are interesting and suggest a potential chemopreventive action which could be useful for further studies in order to develop chemopreventive agents for colon cancer.

Here we reproduced an age-dependent model of the periodontium. a fully physiological approach to periodontal conditions. to evaluate the impact of dietary fat type on gingival tissue of young (6 months old) and old (24 months old) rats.   Methods/FindingsAnimals were fed life-long on diets based on monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) as virgin olive oil. n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6PUFA). as sunflower oil. or n-3PUFA. as fish oil. Age-related alveolar bone loss was higher in n-6PUFA fed rats. probably as a consequence of the ablation of the cell capacity to adapt to aging. Gene expression analysis suggests that MUFA or n-3PUFA allowed mitochondria to maintain an adequate turnover through induction of biogenesis. autophagy and the antioxidant systems. and avoiding mitochondrial electron transport system alterations.   ConclusionsThe main finding is that the enhanced alveolar bone loss associated to age may be targeted by an appropriate dietary treatment. The mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are related with an ablation of the cell capacity to adapt to aging. Thus. MUFA or n-3PUFA might allow mitochondrial maintaining turnover through biogenesis or autophagy. They might also be able to induce the corresponding antioxidant systems to counteract age-related oxidative stress. and do not inhibit mitochondrial electron transport chain.

Shortly after being discovered. it was recognized as an essential electron transport chain component in mitochondria where it is particularly abundant. Since then. more additional roles in cell physiology have been reported. including antioxidant. signaling. death prevention. and others. It is known that all cells are able to synthesize functionally sufficient amounts of CoQ under normal physiological conditions. However. CoQ is a molecule found in different dietary sources. which can be taken up and incorporated into biological membranes. It is known that mitochondria have a close relationship with the aging process. Additionally. delaying the aging process through diet has aroused the interest of scientists for many years. These observations have stimulated investigation of the anti-aging potential of CoQ and its possible use in dietary therapies to alleviate the effects of aging.

Among them. cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are responsible for a 47% of worldwide mortality. In general. preventive approaches modifying lifestyle are more cost-effective than treatments after disease onset. In this sense. a healthy diet could help a range of NCDs. such as cancer and CVDs. Traditional Mediterranean Diet (MD) is associated by the low-prevalence of certain types of cancers and CVDs. where olive oil plays an important role. In fact. different epidemiological studies suggest that olive oil consumption prevents some cancers. as well as coronary heart diseases and stroke incidence and mortality. Historically. the beneficial health effects of virgin olive oil (VOO) intake were first attributed to the high concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids. Nowadays. many studies indicate that phenolic compounds contained in olive oil have positive effects on different biomarkers related to health. Among them. phenolic compounds would be partially responsible for health benefits. The present work aims to explore. in studies published during the last five years. the effects of the main phenolic compounds isolated from olive oil on different cancer or CVD aspects. in order to clarify which compounds have more potential to be used as nutraceuticals with preventive or even therapeutic properties.

In this work. the content of total phenolic compounds. flavonoids. anthocyanins and antioxidant capacity (TEAC. FRAP and DPPH) of achenes and flesh were compared in non-digested as well as in gastric and intestinal extracts after in vitro digestion. Results showed that. despite strawberry achenes represent a small fraction of the fruit. their contribution to total fruit antioxidant content was more than 41% and accounted for 81% of antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Achenes have higher quantity and different quality of antioxidants in non-digested and digested extracts. Antioxidant release was higher in the in vitro gastric digested extracts. but digestion conditions did not only affect quantity but quality. resulting in differences in antioxidant capacity and highlighting the importance of simulating physiological-like extraction conditions for assessing fruit antioxidant properties on human health.

It was possible to confirm that the dietary fat induced higher phospholipid degradation in mitochondrial membranes; moreover an endogenous oxidative stress induced by adriamycin was able to increase the peroxidative effects. We have found that the peroxidative effects could sometimes induce an apparent enhancement of cytochrome oxidase activity due to a significant increase of cytochrome a+a3content. This finding lets us suppose that both changes in the lipid environment and some peroxidation damage could occur in the membrane as a consequence of the fat assumed.

In this respect. there is agreement about that nutritional status may be a modifying factor in the progression and healing of the periodontal tissues. Vitamins have been recommended as nutraceuticals for prevention and treatment of some pathological conditions. such as cardiovascular diseases. obesity or cancer. Thus. a systematic approach to determining how the different vitamin type could ameliorate periodontal risks or improve periodontal health is necessary to further the understanding of the potential benefits and risks of vitamins supplementation use. For this. a systematic review of English-written literature in PubMed until February 2018. which included both human and animal research on the relationship of each vitamin with periodontal disease. was conducted. Among all the analyzed vitamins those with antioxidant capacity and effects on immune system seem to be useful for prevention or improvement of periodontal disease. as well as those implicated in bone metabolism. In the first case. there are quite information in favor of various vitamins. mainly vitamin C. that is the most studied. In the second case. vitamin D seems to have the most relevant role.

Healthy dietary patterns. with abundant fruit and vegetable consumption. may prevent the onset of these risk factors due to the presence of phytochemical compounds. Strawberries are known for their high content of polyphenols; among them. flavonoids are the major constituents. and it is presumed that they are responsible for the biological activity of the fruit. Nevertheless. there are only a few studies that actually evaluate the effects of different fractions isolated from strawberries. In order to assess the effects of two different strawberry extracts (whole methanolic extract/anthocyanin-enriched fraction) on the lipid profile and antioxidant status in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. the triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol content. lipid peroxidation. intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and antioxidant enzymes’ activity on cell lysates were determined. Results demonstrated that both strawberry extracts not only improved the lipid metabolism by decreasing triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol contents. but also improved the redox state of HepG2 cells by modulating thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances production. antioxidant enzyme activity and ROS generation.

Their management is difficult and the development of antibiotic resistance by both planktonic and biofilm-associated bacteria necessitates the use of alternative treatments. The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of four honeys from different floral and geographical origins: Melipona beecheii honey (Cuba) and three Apis mellifera honeys [Manuka honey (New Zealand). Apis mellifera honey (Cuba). and African honey (Kenya)]. The physicochemical parameters were within the ranges reported for these honeys and M. beecheii honey stood out due to its acidic character. An agar incorporation technique was used to determine the minimum active dilution of each honey against 52 clinical isolates (34 Gram-positive. 17 Gram-negative. and 1 Candida albicans). The antibiofilm activity of honeys was tested by assessing their ability to inhibit biofilm formation and to disrupt preformed biofilms. Overall. M. beecheii honey had the highest antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity. although a marked disruption in preformed biofilms was shared by all tested honeys. Structural changes induced by M. beecheii honey on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells were observed by transmission electron microscopy suggesting that this honey has a potent antimicrobial action and may be an excellent candidate for the development of topical preparations for the treatment of infected wounds.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:nqdriD65xNoC,23,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01378/full,16291182893431336944,/scholar?cites=16291182893431336944,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01378/full,0,0,0

Periodontal therapy has been traditionally directed at reduction of the bacterial load to a level that encourages health-promoting bacteria and maintenance of oral-hygiene. The role of nutrition in different chronic inflammatory diseases has been the subject of an increasing body of research in the last decades. In this sense. there has been an important increase in the volume of research on role of nutrition in periodontitis since the diet has known effects on the immune system and inflammatory cascades. Minerals play a key role in all these processes due to the multiple pathways where they participate. To clarify the role of the different minerals in the establishment. progression and/or treatment of this pathology. a systemically review of published literature cited in PubMed until May 2016 was conducted. which included research on the relationship of these elements with the onset and progression of periodontal disease. Among all the minerals. calcium dietary intake seems important to maintain alveolar bone. Likewise. dietary proportions of minerals that may influence its metabolism also can be relevant. Lastly. some observations suggest that all those minerals with roles in immune and/or antioxidant systems should be considered in future research.

Carambola (Averrhoa carambola L.) had the highest total phenolic. flavonoid. and total antioxidant capacity values. whereas guava fruits (Psidium guajava L.) had the highest vitamin C values. The main organic acids identified were lactic. citric. and acetic acids. and the highest amount of lactic acid was found in soursop fruits (Annona muricata L.). whereas Ecuadorian ivory palm (Phytelephas aequatorialis Spruce) and guava fruits had the highest acetic acid content. Guava also had the highest citric acid content; the highest concentration of oxalic acid was found in carambola. In terms of sugar content. giant granadilla (Passiflora quadrangularis L.) had the highest values of glucose. and red mombin (Spondias mombin L.) had the largest values for fructose and guava for sucrose. Chili pepper (Capsicum chinense Jacq) proved to be the main source of carotenoids. lutein. and β-carotene. anthocyanins. and vitamin C. The results here increase our knowledge regarding the composition of the main fruits consumed on the west coast of Ecuador to facilitate recommendations as potential sources of health-promoting compounds.

Male Wistar rats were maintained for 6 or 24 months on two diets varying in the fat source. namely virgin olive oil. rich in monounsaturated fatty acids. or sunflower oil. rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Both dietary fats were supplemented or not with coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10). Bone mineral density (BMD) was evaluated in the femur. Serum levels of osteocalcin. osteopontin. receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL). osteoprotegerin (OPG). adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and parathyroid hormone (PTH). as well as urinary F 2-isoprostanes were measured. Aged animals fed on virgin olive oil showed higher BMD than those fed on sunflower oil. In addition. CoQ 10 prevented the age-related decline in BMD in animals fed on sunflower oil. Urinary F 2-isoprostanes analysis showed that sunflower oil led to the highest oxidative status in old animals. which was avoided by supplementation with CoQ 10.

Serum osteocalcin. osteopontin. receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand. ostroprotegerin. parathyroid hormone. urinary F 2-isoprostanes. and lymphocytes DNA strand breaks were also measured. BMD was lower in aged rats fed a diet without CoQ 10 respect than their younger counterparts. whereas older animals receiving CoQ 10 showed the highest BMD.

Supplementation with CoQ 10 prevented oxidative damage to lipid and DNA. in young and old animals. respectively. Reduced oxidative stress associated to CoQ 10 supplementation of this n-3 PUFA-rich diet might explain the higher BMD found in aged rats in this group of animals.

According to publication type. randomized-controlled trials. cohort. case-control and cross-sectional studies were included. Among all the analyzed components. those that have any effect on oxidative stress and/or inflammation seem to be the most interesting according to current evidence. On one hand. there is quite a lot of information in favor of a positive role of n-3 fatty acids. due to their antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects. On the other hand. saturated fat-rich diets increase oxidative stress as well the as intensity and duration of inflammatory processes. so they must be avoided.

We investigated if chronic administration of CsA may have some effects on the lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant pattern of rat liver mitochondria and on their morphological structure. It seems that CsA administration does not statistically affect the redox status of the antioxidants investigated and their amounts (vitamin E. CoQ9. CoQ10. glutathione.uric acid and ascorbic acid) despite the variety of effects that this treatment produces at physiological and morphological levels.

When congestive heart failure is clinically overt. treatment is extremely difficult. It may improve symptoms for some time. but the therapies are not causal. Recent trials with ACE-inhibitors have offered the patients relief of symptoms and also better survival rates when compared to the classical antifailure principles. But the disease itself has not been cured and the general outlook is poor.Till this date. heart transplantation has been the only avenue to success regarding survival in patients with severe heart failure. However. serious problems remain with respect to the large number of potential recipients waiting. and dying. due to the limited donor availability. Therefore it is necessary to continue the efforts clinically and investigatively. to improve the classification and thereby the treatment of patients with dilated myocardial disease. Endomyocardial biopsy is a rather new technique enabling the obtainment of fresh cardiac muscle from patients with a variety of cardiac diseases.

The cultivar of each berry that showed the higher content of total phenols and flavonoids was selected to study its cytotoxic effect on human hepatoma cells. Digestion resulted in a high reduction (p˂ 0.05) of total phenolic. flavonoid and anthocyanin contents and total antioxidant capacity. in the “IN” samples compared to the “OUT” extracts. which represent the “serum-available” and the “colon-available” fractions. respectively. Incubation of the digested fraction for 24 h didn’t exert any effect on cellular viability. while a dose-and time-dependent cytotoxicity was observed after 48 h and 72 h of incubation for all the berries analyzed. Our results suggest that the approach proposed in this work may represent a rapid tool for evaluating and identifying new berries with increased phytochemical bioavailability. highlighting their antiproliferative agents after an in vitro digestion.

Although RA has been described in the medical literature for over two hundred years. its etiology and pathophysiology are insufficiently understood. The current treatment of RA is mainly empirical or based on drugs that interfere with generic steps of the immune response. with limited efficacy and/or significant side effects. Much of RA research has been traditionally based on animals and simplistic in vitro models. which have been shown to poorly recapitulate human RA etiopathogenesis and drug responses. A revolution in science and technology has produced a new generation of more relevant and predictive tools. These tools. which include patient-derived cells. innovative 3D cell culture systems. computational analyses and models. together with omics and large-scale epidemiological studies represent novel and exciting approaches to enhance and forward RA research in a human biology-based perspective. After considering some pitfalls and flaws of traditional models. in this review we discuss novel tools applicable to design human-oriented RA research. while fostering the need for a more holistic and preventative approach to the disease. Our goal is to stimulate discussion. both at scientific and public level. on the need to explore new avenues in RA research and to support a paradigm-shift from animal-based towards human biology-based systems to better understand human pathophysiology and to develop more effective targeted therapies for …,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:60iIaj97TE0C,6,https://www.altex.org/index.php/altex/article/view/1434,9541876621075774439,/scholar?cites=9541876621075774439,,https://www.altex.org/index.php/altex/article/download/1434/1725,0,0,0

The fatty acids are considered to be responsible for these benefits of flaxseed. Herein. the in vitro effects of flaxseed extract on the growth and apoptosis of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were investigated. The MCF-7 cells treated with flaxseed extract showed a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability. The flaxseed extract induced reactive oxygen species and the flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that flaxseed fatty acids triggered apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. which was also shown by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase cascade reaction. Thus. the flaxseed extract regulated the growth of MCF-7 cells and induced apoptosis.

A DR model in C57BL/6 mice was established after intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). After intravitreal injection with TTR pAAV vector. MEG3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA). scrambled shRNA. or MEG3. retinal imaging. retinal trypsin digestion. and fundus vascular permeability tests were performed. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8). transwell. and Matrigel assays were employed to detect the proliferation and migration of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hRECs). The binding between long non-coding RNA of maternally expressed gene 3 (lncRNA-MEG3) and microRNA-223-3p (miR-223-3p) was observed by using luciferase reporter assays. while co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) was employed to confirm the interaction between TTR and the target. In the DR mice model. retinal vascular leakage and angiogenesis were repressed by overexpressing TTR. In vitro. the added TTR promoted the level of lncRNA-MEG3 by interacting with poly (A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1). and then repressed proliferation and angiogenesis of hRECs. In vivo. silencing or overexpressing lncRNA-MEG3 significantly affected retinal vascular phenotypes. Additionally. the interaction between lncRNA-MEG3 and miR-223-3p was confirmed. and silencing of miR-223-3p revealed similar effects on hRECs as overexpression of lncRNA-MEG3.

Frequently. this bee product is contaminated with pesticides reducing its utility and causing the decline in its market. This study aimed to prove the effectiveness of an industrial-scale decontamination method in removing acaricides from beeswax. Chlorfenvinphos and coumaphos decrease was higher than 90%. whereas tau fluvalinate decrease was only 30%. No changes were observed in the beeswax content of hydrocarbons and monoesters. whereas a decrease in the concentrations of Ca. Fe. Zn. Hg. Mn and P. and an increase in the concentrations of As and Si were found after the decontamination. Filtration reduced total phenolics. flavonoids and the antioxidant capacity of the lipophilic extract. These results demonstrate that the industrial method used was as effective as the method previously tested on a laboratory scale. The study also contributes to a better knowledge and characterization of beeswax. specially related to trace and ultra-trace elements and antioxidant capacity.

In parallel. a growing body of epidemiological studies suggests a consistent association between the consumption of plant-based diets and a lower incidence of several chronic pathologies. including cancer. cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.Materials and methodsThe first aim of this work was to evaluate the nutritional quality of the strawberry cultivar Sveva. by measuring the total antioxidant capacity. total phenolic. total …,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC,3,https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1753-6561-6-S3-P5,8096803139323307094,/scholar?cites=8096803139323307094,,,0,0,0

The present study was designed to investigate the potential interest of squalene in the combinatory therapy of breast cancer with adriamycin in the breast cancer cell line MCF7. Results showed a dosage-response decrease of adriamycin on cell viability. and for all adriamycin dosages. squalene decreased or did not change viability. Squalene reduced or did not affect adriamycin apoptosis. and finally no effect of squalene was found on G0–G1 phase of the cell cycle. These results. together with previous studies. suggest that as for other natural compounds. potential anticancer effects of squalene could depend on the phenotype. Thus. there is still a need for further investigations aimed at ascertaining the real potential of squalene. using in vitro. but …,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC,3,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12349-010-0019-6.pdf,4921518092701608378,/scholar?cites=4921518092701608378,,,0,0,0

The oral cavity. a very complex and unique milieu due to its dual function. is the only place in the body where the mineralized tissue is exposed to the external environment in which there are complex interactions between various surfaces: host soft and hard tissues. food. air. and microorganisms. Saliva includes a large number of inorganic and organic compounds. which act as a ‘mirror of the body's health.’In addition to its other functions. saliva could constitute the first line of defense against oxidative stress. Due to its composition and functions. saliva could have a significant role in controlling and/or modulating oxidative damages in the oral cavity.

In order to contribute to the knowledge of biochemical mechanisms leading to this condition. the effects of two i.p. high doses of phenobarbitone administered to the rat (acute treatment) on the distribution of hepatic folate derivatives have been studied. A significant decrease of unsubstituted tetrahydro- and dihydropteroylpentaglutamates and 5.10-methylenetetrahydropentaglutamates was observed.

Boston. MA,It is presently recognized that the transfer of electrons from substrates to molecular oxygen in mitochondria involves integral membrane protein complexes containing redox groups of increasing redox potentials (Tzagoloff. 1982). According to the original intuition of Green (1966). it is widely accepted that electron transfer between complexes is ensured by mobile components acting as cosubstrates. vz. ubiquinone (Q) and cytochrome c (cyt.c).
