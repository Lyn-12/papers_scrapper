They completed 80 rounds (240 trials) of a strategic sequential investment task that required accepting interim losses in order to access a lucrative state and maximize long-term gains. while being scanned.

7180,Brain fMRI processing and classification based on combination of PCA and SVM,2009,Song-yun Xie and Rong Guo and Ning-fei Li and Ge Wang and Hai-tao Zhao,,,,3384-3389,IEEE,fMRI is one of the fundamental tools for functional human brain research. However. fMRI data are often in a high dimensional feature space and suffer greatly from large and complex dataset. To relieve the curse of dimensionality in fMRI image. PCA combines with SVM to form a feature-based classification method in this work. PCA is employed to find a more compact and reasonable representation of the data by extracting features from each fMRI image. Then a linear kernel SVM classifier is trained on the selected features to detect different brain states. The advantage of incorporating PCA with SVM is twofold: Firstly. the computational burden on SVM classifier is reduced significantly. Secondly. a less complex classifier is well established. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields good performance. The correct rate of our hand-movement fMRI study with both healthy subjects and a tumor patient …,True,tAjtMvUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,18,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5179085/,16605493994629708041,/scholar?cites=16605493994629708041,,,0
7181,Interaction of instrumental and goal-directed learning modulates prediction error representations in the ventral striatum,2016,Rong Guo and Wendelin Böhmer and Martin Hebart and Samson Chien and Tobias Sommer and Klaus Obermayer and Jan Gläscher,36,Journal of Neuroscience,50,12650-12660,Society for Neuroscience,Goal-directed and instrumental learning are both important controllers of human behavior. Learning about which stimulus event occurs in the environment and the reward associated with them allows humans to seek out the most valuable stimulus and move through the environment in a goal-directed manner. Stimulus–response associations are characteristic of instrumental learning. whereas response–outcome associations are the hallmark of goal-directed learning. Here we provide behavioral. computational. and neuroimaging results from a novel task in which stimulus–response and response–outcome associations are learned simultaneously but dominate behavior at different stages of the experiment. We found that prediction error representations in the ventral striatum depend on which type of learning dominates.

7191,Full duplex-transceivers: architectures and performance analysis,2017,Bilal Alauldeen Jebur,,,,,,The revolution of the 5G communication systems will result in 10.000 times increase in the total mobile broadband traffic in the 2020s. which will increase the demand on the limited wireless spectrum. This has highlighted the need for an efficient frequency-reuse technique that can meet the ever-increasing demand on the available frequency resources. In-band full-duplex (FD) wireless technology that enables the transceiver nodes to transmit and receive simultaneously over the same frequency band. has gained tremendous attention as a promising technology to double the spectral efficiency of the traditional half-duplex (HD) systems. However. this technology faces a formidable challenge. that is the large power difference between the self-interference (SI) signal and the signal of interest from a remote transceiver node. In this thesis. we focus on the architecture of the FD transceivers and investigate their ability to approximately double the throughput and the spectral efficiency of the conventional HD systems. Moreover. this thesis is concerned with the design of efficient self-interference cancellation schemes that can be combined with the architecture of the FD transceiver nodes in order to effectively suppress the SI signal and enable the FD mode. In particular. an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) based amplify-and-forward (AF) FD physical-layer network coding (PLNC) system is proposed. To enable the FD mode in the proposed system. a hybrid SIC scheme that is a combination of passive SIC mechanism and active SIC technique is exploited at each transceiver node of that system.

This paper presents characterization results of the self-interference (SI) channel from experimental data obtained by sea trials in the North Sea. Two scenarios are considered. ie hard and soft sea bottom with water column depths of 50 m. Initial results indicate that the delay spread of the local reverberation can extend up to 1.5 s before it reaches the noise floor level. This in turn has significant implications on the required hardware complexity of the SI mitigation methods based on adaptive filter echo cancellation. which will require tens of thousands of filter taps to deal with this delay spread range and prolonged training periods. Furthermore. the achievable range of the FD-based communication links will be affected by the levels of SI present in these channels. therefore. the results and channel modelling presented in this paper will be useful to FD modem designers.,True,RQyU-dgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,1,http://www.uaconferences.org/docs/2019_papers/UACE2019_1014_Healy.pdf,17139735891139574627,/scholar?cites=17139735891139574627,,http://www.uaconferences.org/docs/2019_papers/UACE2019_1014_Healy.pdf,0

7199,Short-Term Wind Speed Forecasting Using Statistical and Machine Learning Methods,2020,Lucky O Daniel and Caston Sigauke and Colin Chibaya and Rendani Mbuvha,13,Algorithms,6,132,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Wind offers an environmentally sustainable energy resource that has seen increasing global adoption in recent years. However. its intermittent. unstable and stochastic nature hampers its representation among other renewable energy sources. This work addresses the forecasting of wind speed. a primary input needed for wind energy generation. using data obtained from the South African Wind Atlas Project. Forecasting is carried out on a two days ahead time horizon. We investigate the predictive performance of artificial neural networks (ANN) trained with Bayesian regularisation. decision trees based stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) and generalised additive models (GAMs). The results of the comparative analysis suggest that ANN displays superior predictive performance based on root mean square error (RMSE). In contrast. SGB shows outperformance in terms of mean average error (MAE) and the related mean average percentage error (MAPE). A further comparison of two forecast combination methods involving the linear and additive quantile regression averaging show the latter forecast combination method as yielding lower prediction accuracy. The additive quantile regression averaging based prediction intervals also show outperformance in terms of validity. reliability. quality and accuracy. Interval combination methods show the median method as better than its pure average counterpart.

Despite many years of research. definitive evidence that genetic effects operate in this way is lacking. The limited behavioral test regimes so far used in genetic mapping experiments and the lack of suitable multivariate methodologies have made it impossible to determine whether the quantitative trait loci (QTL) detected to date specifically influence fear-related traits.

Serotonergic and muscarinic-cholinergic signals in the brain are largely mediated through the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides by PLC. Objectives: The aim of the experiments reported here was to explore the potential differences in neurotransmitter receptor coupling to PLC in Roman high-avoidance (RHA)/Verh and Roman low-avoidance (RLA)/Verh rats. by examining the changes in agonist (carbachol. 5-methyltryptamine)-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in hippocampal and cortical membranes derived from the two rat lines.

(1988) reported that the anxiolytic effects of diazepam and alprazolam on shuttle box avoidance acquisition were not present in handling-habituated rats.  In support of that. partially similar results were also found in the elevated plus-maze test (Brett and Prat. 1990; File et al. 1992).  However these reports do not provide a complete analysis of [lsquo ]handling [times ] benzodiazepine[rsquo ] interactions. since a very limited range of benzodiazepine doses and single handling procedures have been used.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anxiolytic effects of alprazolam (3 doses) on shuttle box acquisition in handling-naive and handling-habituated rats (using 2 types of handling exposure).Animals were 92 male Sprague-Dawley rats (9 weeks old; weighing 270-300 g).  Two different handling procedures (H10 and H14) were used. The first one (H10) was administered for 10 consecutive days and consisted of picking up the rat by its body and weighing it (4 times a day). and then giving and i.p. injection (1 ml/kg. twice a day. morning and evening) of vehicle (VEH. 1% carboxymethylcellulose).  In the H14 procedure rats were handled once daily (as for H10 treatment. including one daily i.p. injection) for 14 consecutive days.  Control non-handled (NH) rats were left undisturbed until testing.  In the testing day (the day after finishing handling treatments). all animals received an i.p. injection (1 ml/kg) of either vehicle (VEH groups). or alprazolam (ALP; 0.75. 1.25 or 1.75 mg/kg; suspended in 1% carboxymethylcellulose) 30 min before testing in the shuttle box (40 trials. each consisting of: 10-sec CS. light and tone; 30-sec US. a 0.4 …,True,rN2tDIgAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,2,https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-10e05d51-7d43-3b23-bd47-a5eaa4c16701,11970998665481669418,/scholar?cites=11970998665481669418,,,0

Servicio de Publicaciones,When organisms perceive any perturbation in the outside word that can disrupt homeostasis. they engage in a set of physiological responses in order to reestablish homeostasis. But. if mantained for a long time. those responses can be damaging and. in fact. they could be related to the appearance of some age-related deficits. Two early manipulations. such as environmental enrichment and postnatal handling have been hypothesized to prevent age-related cognitive and neural deficits in rodents. A long-lasting reduction of emotional reactivity to stress has been proposed as the main mechanism mediating long-term effects of both treatments.

7299,Differences Between Two Psychogenetically Selected Lines of Rats in a Swimming Pool Matching-To-Place Task: Long-Term Effects of Infantile Stimulation,2001,Raúl Aguilar and Rosa M Escorihuela and Luis Gil and Adolf Tobeña and Alberto Fernández-teruel,,,,,,The present study explored the effects of infantile stimulation (ie. neonatal handling or NH) on the performance of 18-month-old Roman high-avoidance (RHA/Verh) and low-avoidance (RLA/Verh) rats in a swimming pool matching-to-place (SPMP) test. This test (also called repeated acquisition and place learning-set paradigm) consists of administering pairs of consecutive trials in the Morris water maze. The difference between each “odd” and the consecutive “even” trial of a trial pair is considered to be a measure of working memory. The same rats were first tested for exploration and novelty-seeking in a hole-board test in the presence of novel objects. which showed that RHA/Verh rats were more explorative than their RLA/Verh counterparts. and that NH treatment augmented exploration in RLA/Verh rats. generally eliminating the genetically-based differences between the lines. RHA/Verh rats performed less efficiently than RLA/Verh rats in the SPMP test. and NH facilitated acquisition in the early stages of training in both rat lines. an effect that was presumably due to an improvement in the acquisition of spatial reference information. Performance during training also indicated that RHA/Verh rats showed less differentiated behavior between odd and even trials. indicating a relative working memory deficit at advanced ages in that rat line.

However. the costs involved in engaging users often requires practitioners to trade off between sample size. time requirements. and monetary costs. Micro-task markets. such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk. offer a potential paradigm for engaging a large number of users for low time and monetary costs. Here we investigate the utility of a micro-task market for collecting user measurements. and discuss design considerations for developing remote micro user evaluation tasks.

It emerged as a simple yet powerful way of disseminating information in the Twitter social network. Even though a lot of information is shared in Twitter. little is known yet about how and why certain information spreads more widely than others. In this paper. we examine a number of features that might affect retweetability of tweets. We gathered content and contextual features from 74M tweets and used this data set to identify factors that are significantly associated with retweet rate. We also built a predictive retweet model. We found that. amongst content features. URLs and hashtags have strong relationships with retweetability. Amongst contextual features. the number of followers and followees as well as the age of the account seem to affect retweetability. while. interestingly. the number of past tweets does not predict retweetability of a user's tweet …,True,VuWl-KUAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,1351,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5590452/,4176598563614687069,/scholar?cites=4176598563614687069,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.295.320&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

This is useful because implementers can quickly identify various techniques that can be applied to their domain of interest.

Their surfing patterns or actions are guided by their information needs. Researchers need tools to explore the complex interactions between user needs. user actions. and the structures and contents of the Web. In this paper. we describe two computational methods for understanding the relationship between user needs and user actions. First. for a particular pattern of surfing. we seek to infer the associated information need. Second. given an information need. and some pages as starting pints. we attempt to predict the expected surfing patterns. The algorithms use a concept called “information scent”. which is the subjective sense of value and cost of accessing a page based on perceptual cues.

However. it is an open question whether the success of Wikipedia results from a “wisdom of crowds” type of effect in which a large number of people each make a small number of edits. or whether it is driven by a core group of “elite” users who do the lion’s share of the work. In this study we examined how the influence of “elite” vs.“common” users changed over time in Wikipedia. The results suggest that although Wikipedia was driven by the influence of “elite” users early on. more recently there has been a dramatic shift in workload to the “common” user. We also show the same shift in del. icio. us. a very different type of social collaborative knowledge system.

We performed the first in-depth study of user behavior with regard to the location field in Twitter user profiles. We found that 34% of users did not provide real location information. frequently incorporating fake locations or sarcastic comments that can fool traditional geographic information tools. When users did input their location. they almost never specified it at a scale any more detailed than their city. In order to determine whether or not natural user behaviors have a real effect on the'locatability'of users. we performed a simple machine learning experiment to determine whether we can identify a user's location by only looking at what that user tweets.

In this paper we studied content recommendation on Twitter to better direct user attention. In a modular approach. we explored three separate dimensions in designing such a recommender: content sources. topic interest models for users. and social voting. We implemented 12 recommendation engines in the design space we formulated. and deployed them to a recommender service on the web to gather feedback from real Twitter users.

7331,ScentTrails: Integrating browsing and searching on the Web,2003,Christopher Olston and Ed H Chi,10,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI),3,177-197,ACM,The two predominant paradigms for finding information on the Web are browsing and keyword searching. While they exhibit complementary advantages. neither paradigm alone is adequate for complex information goals that lend themselves partially to browsing and partially to searching. To integrate browsing and searching smoothly into a single interface. we introduce a novel approach called ScentTrails. Based on the concept of information scent developed in the context of information foraging theory. ScentTrails highlights hyperlinks to indicate paths to search results. This interface enables users to interpolate smoothly between searching and browsing to locate content matching complex information goals effectively. In a preliminary user study. ScentTrails enabled subjects to find information more quickly than by either searching or browsing alone.,True,VuWl-KUAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,334,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/937549.937550,7143209517795743848,/scholar?cites=7143209517795743848,,http://infolab.stanford.edu/~olston/publications/scenttrails.pdf,0

7377,Who is authoritative? understanding reputation mechanisms in quora,2012,Sharoda A Paul and Lichan Hong and Ed H Chi,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1204.3724,,,,As social Q&A sites gain popularity. it is important to understand how users judge the authoritativeness of users and content. build reputation. and identify and promote high quality content. We conducted a study of emerging social Q&A site Quora. First. we describe user activity on Quora by analyzing data across 60 question topics and 3917 users. Then we provide a rich understanding of issues of authority. reputation. and quality from in-depth interviews with ten Quora users. Our results show that primary sources of information on Quora are judged authoritative. Also. users judge the reputation of other users based on their past contributions. Social voting helps users identify and promote good content but is prone to preferential attachment. Combining social voting with sophisticated algorithms for ranking content might enable users to better judge others' reputation and promote high quality content.,True,VuWl-KUAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC,88,https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3724,10593339106331360268,/scholar?cites=10593339106331360268,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.3724,0

7390,A framework for information visualization spreadsheets,1999,Ed Huai-Hsin Chi,,,,,,Information has become interactive. Information visualization is the design and creation of interactive graphic depictions of information by combining principles in the disciplines of graphic design. cognitive science. and interactive computer graphics. As the volume and complexity of the data increases. users require more powerful visualization tools that allow them to more effectively explore large abstract datasets. This thesis seeks to make information visualization more accessible to potential users by creating a “Visualization Spreadsheet”. where each cell can contain an entire set of data represented using interactive graphics. Just as a numeric spreadsheet enables exploration of numbers. a visualization spreadsheet enables exploration of visual forms of information. Unlike numeric spreadsheets. which store only simple data elements and formulas in each cell. a cell in the Visualization Spreadsheet can hold an entire abstract data set. selection criteria. viewing specifications. and other information needed for a full-fledged information visualization. Similarly. intra-cell and inter-cell operations are far more complex. stretching beyond simple arithmetic and string operations to encompass a range of domain-specific operators.The complexity of operations and interactions requires a visualization framework that is easily understandable to both end-users and visualization designers.

7401,ScentHighlights: highlighting conceptually-related sentences during reading,2005,Ed H Chi and Lichan Hong and Michelle Gumbrecht and Stuart K Card,,,,272-274,,Researchers have noticed that readers are increasingly skimming instead of reading in depth. Skimming also occur in re-reading activities. where the goal is to recall specific topical facts. Bookmarks and highlighters were invented precisely to achieve this goal. For skimming activities. readers need effective ways to direct their attention toward the most relevant passages within text. We describe how we have enhanced skimming activity by conceptually highlighting sentences within electronic text that relate to search keywords. We perform the conceptual highlighting by computing what conceptual keywords are related to each other via word co-occurrence and spreading activation. Spreading activation is a cognitive model developed in psychology to simulate how memory chunks and conceptual items are retrieved in our brain.

GenBank. the primary repository for DNA sequence data. is doubling in size every 1.3 years. Keeping pace with the analysis of these data is a difficult task. One of the most successful technique. for analyzing genetic data is sequence similarity analysis-the comparison of unknown sequences against known sequences kept in databases. As biologists gather more sequence data. sequence similarity algorithms are more and more useful. but take longer and longer to run. BLAST is one of the most popular sequence similarity algorithms in me today. but its running time is approximately proportional to the size of the database. Sequence similarity analysis using BLAST is becoming a bottleneck in genetic sequence analysis. This paper analyzes the performance of BLAST on SMPs. to improve our theoretical and practical understanding of the scalability of the algorithm.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Collaborative filtering (CF) is at the heart of most successful recommender systems nowadays. While this technique often provides useful recommendations. conventional systems also ignore data that could potentially be used to refine and adjust recommendations based on a user’s context and preferences. The problem is particularly acute with mobile systems where information delivery often needs to be contextualized. Past research has also shown that combining CF with other techniques often improves the quality of recommendations. In this paper. we present results from an experiment assessing user satisfaction with recommendations for leisure activities that are obtained from different combinations of these techniques.

We introduce FeedWinnower. an enhanced feed aggregator that helps readers to filter feed items by four facets (topic. people. source. and time). thus facilitating feed triage. The combination of the four facets provides a powerful way for users to slice and dice their personal feeds.

A sequential model with a longer-term memory is better able contextualize recent observations. In this article. we apply the theory of LRD stochastic processes to modern recurrent architectures. such as LSTMs and GRUs. and prove they do not provide LRD under assumptions sufficient for gradients to vanish. Motivated by an information-theoretic analysis. we provide a modified recurrent neural architecture that mitigates the issue of faulty memory through redundancy while keeping the compute time constant.

Inspired by matrix factorization. our approach relies on adding a global quadratic penalty to all pairs of examples and expressing this term as the matrix-inner-product of two generalized Gramians. We show that the gradient of this term can be efficiently computed by maintaining estimates of the Gramians. and develop variance reduction schemes to improve the quality of the estimates. We conduct large-scale experiments that show a significant improvement in training time and generalization quality compared to traditional sampling methods.,True,VuWl-KUAAAAJ:z2g7kDSNNyoC,13,https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07187,14969655596866173703,/scholar?cites=14969655596866173703,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07187,0

Previously. researchers developed ways to debias a model for a single problem domain. However. this is often not how models are trained and used in practice. For example. labels and demographics (sensitive attributes) are often hard to observe. resulting in auxiliary or synthetic data to be used for training. and proxies of the sensitive attribute to be used for evaluation of fairness. A model trained for one setting may be picked up and used in many others. particularly as is common with pre-training and cloud APIs. Despite the pervasiveness of these complexities. remarkably little work in the fairness literature has theoretically examined these issues. We frame all of these settings as domain adaptation problems: how can we use what we have learned in a source domain to debias in a new target domain. without directly debiasing on the target domain as if it is a completely new problem? We offer new theoretical guarantees of improving fairness across domains. and offer a modeling approach to transfer to data-sparse target domains.

It is a commonly used technique for model compression. where a higher capacity teacher model with better quality is used to train a more compact student model with better inference efficiency. Through distillation. one hopes to benefit from student's compactness. without sacrificing too much on model quality. Despite the large success of knowledge distillation. better understanding of how it benefits student model's training dynamics remains under-explored. In this paper. we dissect the effects of knowledge distillation into three main factors:(1) benefits inherited from label smoothing.(2) example re-weighting based on teacher's confidence on ground-truth. and (3) prior knowledge of optimal output (logit) layer geometry. Using extensive systematic analyses and empirical studies on synthetic and real-world datasets. we confirm that the aforementioned three factors play a major role in knowledge distillation.

In this task. it is especially important to present the user with a slate of items that is appealing as a whole. This in turn requires taking into account interactions between items. since intuitively. placing an item on the slate affects the decision of which other items should be placed alongside it. In this work. we propose a sequence-to-sequence model for ranking called seq2slate. At each step. the model predicts the nextbest'item to place on the slate given the items already selected. The sequential nature of the model allows complex dependencies between the items to be captured directly in a flexible and scalable way.

Microblogging generates volumes of interesting social content. but there is a lack of frameworks and tools that allow us to exploit such information and enhance knowledge workers’ sensemaking. Beyond adoption. we believe that new promising research directions on microblogging include designing and evaluating tools that extract and exploit social information.

7508,Information seeking with social signals: Anatomy of a social tag-based exploratory search browser,2010,Ed H Chi and Rowan Nairn,,Workshop on Social Recommender Systems,,,,Whereas for the fact-retrieval searches. optimal paths to the documents containing the required information are crucial. learning and investigation activities lead to a more continuous and exploratory process with the knowledge acquired during this “journey” being essential as well. Therefore. information seeking systems should focus on providing cues that might make these explorations more efficient. One possible solution is in building information seeking systems in which navigation signposts are provided by social cues provided by a large number of other people. One possible source for social cues is all of the social bookmarks on social tagging sites. Social tagging arose out of the need to organize found information that is worth revisiting. The collective behavior of users who tagged contents seems to offer a good basis for exploratory search interfaces. even for users who are not using social bookmarking sites.

The emergence of the Web as a global information environment has fueled the interests of many researchers and practitioners in how to make the Web as useful as it can be. Crucial to its success are its ubiquitous and searchable qualities. Despite its success. most of the current practices of Web design are based on empirical observations and intuition. The development of an accurate cognitive model of how users search for information on the Web is crucial to Web usability. because researchers and practitioners alike require a more complete and deeper understanding of users’ decision processes than what we know today.

However. in practice factors like privacy and regulation often preclude the collection of protected features. or their use for training or inference. severely limiting the applicability of traditional fairness research. Therefore we ask: How can we train a ML model to improve fairness when we do not even know the protected group memberships? In this work we address this problem by proposing Adversarially Reweighted Learning (ARL). In particular. we hypothesize that non-protected features and task labels are valuable for identifying fairness issues. and can be used to co-train an adversarial reweighting approach for improving fairness.

Many techniques have been proposed to ameliorate these issues. including various algorithmic and architectural modifications. Two of the most successful RNN architectures. the LSTM and the GRU. do exhibit modest improvements over vanilla RNN cells. but they still suffer from instabilities when trained on very long sequences. In this work. we develop a mean field theory of signal propagation in LSTMs and GRUs that enables us to calculate the time scales for signal propagation as well as the spectral properties of the state-to-state Jacobians. By optimizing these quantities in terms of the initialization hyperparameters. we derive a novel initialization scheme that eliminates or reduces training instabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our initialization scheme on multiple sequence tasks. on which it enables successful training while a standard initialization either fails completely or is orders of magnitude slower. We also observe a beneficial effect on generalization performance using this new initialization.,True,VuWl-KUAAAAJ:12nnf2f32iYC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08987,10643141578483483081,/scholar?cites=10643141578483483081,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08987,0

7531,A Machine Learning Approach to Databases Indexes,2017,Alex Beutel and Tim Kraska and EH Chi and Jeffrey Dean and Neoklis Polyzotis,,,,,NIPS,Databases rely on indexing data structures to efficiently perform many of their core operations. In order to look up all records in a particular range of keys. databases use a BTree-Index. In order to look up the record for a single key. databases use a Hash-Index. In order to check if a key exists. databases use a BitMap-Index (a bloom filter). These data structures have been studied and improved for decades. carefully tuned to best utilize each CPU cycle and cache available. However. they do not focus on leveraging the distribution of data they are indexing. In this paper. we demonstrate that these critical data structures are merely models. and can be replaced with more flexible. faster. and smaller machine learned neural networks. Further. we demonstrate how machine learned indexes can be combined with classic data structures to provide the guarantees expected of database indexes. Our initial results show. that we are able to outperform B-Trees by up to 44% in speed while saving over 2/3 of the memory.

In this work. we present a Controlled Adversarial Text Generation (CAT-Gen) model that. given an input text. generates adversarial texts through controllable attributes that are known to be invariant to task labels. For example. in order to attack a model for sentiment classification over product reviews. we can use the product categories as the controllable attribute which would not change the sentiment of the reviews. Experiments on real-world NLP datasets demonstrate that our method can generate more diverse and fluent adversarial texts. compared to many existing adversarial text generation approaches. We further use our generated adversarial examples to improve models through adversarial training. and we demonstrate that our generated attacks are more robust against model re-training and different model architectures.,True,VuWl-KUAAAAJ:5Y7y0xowK3MC,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02338,4373365801876787000,/scholar?cites=4373365801876787000,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02338,0
7542,Improving uncertainty estimates through the relationship with adversarial robustness,2020,Yao Qin and Xuezhi Wang and Alex Beutel and Ed H Chi,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.16375,,,,Robustness issues arise in a variety of forms and are studied through multiple lenses in the machine learning literature. Neural networks lack adversarial robustness--they are vulnerable to adversarial examples that through small perturbations to inputs cause incorrect predictions. Further. trust is undermined when models give miscalibrated or unstable uncertainty estimates. ie the predicted probability is not a good indicator of how much we should trust our model and could vary greatly over multiple independent runs. In this paper. we study the connection between adversarial robustness. predictive uncertainty (calibration) and model uncertainty (stability) on multiple classification networks and datasets. We find that the inputs for which the model is sensitive to small perturbations (are easily attacked) are more likely to have poorly calibrated and unstable predictions. Based on this insight. we examine if calibration and stability can be improved by addressing those adversarially unrobust inputs. To this end. we propose Adversarial Robustness based Adaptive Label Smoothing (AR-AdaLS) that integrates the correlations of adversarial robustness and uncertainty into training by adaptively softening labels conditioned on how easily it can be attacked by adversarial examples. We find that our method. taking the adversarial robustness of the in-distribution data into consideration. leads to better calibration and stability over the model even under distributional shifts. In addition. AR-AdaLS can also be applied to an ensemble model to achieve the best calibration performance.,True,VuWl-KUAAAAJ:vlMkzkLhH4wC,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16375,12914609088752610660,/scholar?cites=12914609088752610660,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16375,0

However. training deep RL model is challenging in real world applications such as production-scale health-care or recommender systems because of the expensiveness of interaction and limitation of budget at deployment. One aspect of the data inefficiency comes from the expensive hyper-parameter tuning when optimizing deep neural networks. We propose Adaptive Behavior Policy Sharing (ABPS). a data-efficient training algorithm that allows sharing of experience collected by behavior policy that is adaptively selected from a pool of agents trained with an ensemble of hyper-parameters. We further extend ABPS to evolve hyper-parameters during training by hybridizing ABPS with an adapted version of Population Based Training (ABPS-PBT). We conduct experiments with multiple Atari games with up to 16 hyper-parameter/architecture setups. ABPS achieves superior overall performance. reduced variance on top 25% agents. and equivalent performance on the best agent compared to conventional hyper-parameter tuning with independent training. even though ABPS only requires the same number of environmental interactions as training a single agent.

Research has demonstrated that using clustering to partition search results into coherent. topical clusters can aid in both exploration and discovery. Yet clusters generated by an algorithm for this purpose are often of poor quality and do not satisfy users. To achieve acceptable clustered search results. experts must manually evaluate and refine the clustered results for each search query. a process that does not scale to large numbers of search queries. In this article. we investigate using crowd-based human evaluation to inspect. evaluate. and improve clusters to create high-quality clustered search results at scale.

7553,Learned Index Structures,,Tim Kraska and Alex Beutel and H Chi and Jeffrey Dean and Neoklis Polyzotis,18,,,,SIGMOD,Indexes are models: a BTree-Index can be seen as a model to map a key to the position of a record within a sorted array. a Hash-Index as a model to map a key to a position of a record within an unsorted array. and a BitMap-Index as a model to indicate if a data record exists or not. In this talk. we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types of models. including deeplearning models. which we term learned indexes. The key idea is that a model can learn the sort order or structure of lookup keys and use this signal to effectively predict the position or existence of records. Our initial results show. that by using simple neural nets we are able to outperform cache-optimized B-Trees by up to 70% in speed while saving an order-of-magnitude in memory over several real-world data sets.

It significantly affects model performance. and especially on tail items. To improve tail-item recommendation. we conduct research to transfer knowledge from head items to tail items. leveraging the rich user feedback in head items and the semantic connections between head and tail items. Specifically. we propose a novel dual transfer learning framework that collaboratively learns the knowledge transfer from both model-level and item-level. The model-level knowledge transfer builds a generic meta-mapping of model parameters from few-shot to many-shot model. It captures the implicit data augmentation on the model level to improve the representation learning of tail items. The item-level transfer connects head and tail items through item-level features. to ensure a smooth transfer of meta-mapping from head items to tail items. The two types of transfers are incorporated to ensure the learned knowledge from head items can be well applied for tail item representation learning in the long-tail distribution settings. Through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. results show that our proposed dual transfer learning framework significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for tail item recommendation in hit ratio and NDCG. It is also very encouraging that our framework further improves head items and overall performance on top of the gains on tail items.,True,VuWl-KUAAAAJ:UoSa6IK8DwsC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15982,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15982,0

Typically. the model creates a huge embedding table that each row represents a dedicated embedding vector for every feature value. In practice. to handle new (ie. out-of-vocab) feature values and reduce the storage cost. the hashing trick is often adopted. that randomly maps feature values to a smaller number of hashing buckets. Essentially. thess embedding methods can be viewed as 1-layer wide neural networks with one-hot encodings. In this paper. we propose an alternative embedding framework Deep Hash Embedding (DHE). with non-one-hot encodings and a deep neural network (embedding network) to compute embeddings on the fly without having to store them. DHE first encodes the feature value to a dense vector with multiple hashing functions and then applies a DNN to generate the embedding. DHE is collision-free as the dense hashing encodings are unique identifiers for both in-vocab and out-of-vocab feature values. The encoding module is deterministic. non-learnable. and free of storage. while the embedding network is updated during the training time to memorize embedding information. Empirical results show that DHE outperforms state-of-the-art hashing-based embedding learning algorithms. and achieves comparable AUC against the standard one-hot encoding. with significantly smaller model sizes.

However. the sparse and large feature space requires exhaustive search to identify effective crosses. Deep & Cross Network (DCN) was proposed to automatically and efficiently learn bounded-degree predictive feature interactions. Unfortunately. in models that serve web-scale traffic with billions of training examples. DCN showed limited expressiveness in its cross network at learning more predictive feature interactions. Despite significant research progress made. many deep learning models in production still rely on traditional feed-forward neural networks to learn feature crosses inefficiently.In light of the pros/cons of DCN and existing feature interaction learning approaches. we propose an improved framework DCN-M to make DCN more practical in large-scale industrial settings. In a comprehensive experimental study with extensive hyper-parameter search and model tuning. we observed that DCN-M approaches outperform all the state-of-the-art algorithms on popular benchmark datasets. The improved DCN-M is more expressive yet remains cost efficient at feature interaction learning. especially when coupled with a mixture of low-rank architecture.

Ensemble method is one state-of-the-art benchmark for prediction uncertainty estimation. However. ensembles are expensive to train and serve for web-scale traffic.In this paper. we seek to advance the understanding of prediction variation estimated by the ensemble method. Through empirical experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets MovieLens and Criteo in recommender systems. we observe that prediction variations come from various randomness sources. including training data shuffling. and parameter random initialization. By introducing more randomness into model training. we notice that ensemble's mean predictions tend to be more accurate while the prediction variations tend to be higher. Moreover. we propose to infer prediction variation from neuron activation strength and demonstrate the strong prediction power from activation strength features. Our experiment results show that the average R squared on MovieLens is as high as 0.56 and on Criteo is 0.81. Our method performs especially well when detecting the lowest and highest variation buckets. with 0.92 AUC and 0.89 AUC respectively.

A good solution to a multi-task learning problem should be generalizable in addition to being Pareto optimal. In this paper. we provide some insights on understanding the trade-off between Pareto efficiency and generalization as a result of parameterization in multi-task deep learning models. As a multi-objective optimization problem. enough parameterization is needed for handling task conflicts in a constrained solution space; however. from a multi-task generalization perspective. over-parameterization undermines the benefit of learning a shared representation which helps harder tasks or tasks with limited training examples. A delicate balance between multi-task generalization and multi-objective optimization is therefore needed for finding a better trade-off between efficiency and generalization. To this end. we propose a method of under-parameterized self-auxiliaries for multi-task models to achieve the best of both worlds.

The Plackett-Luce (PL) model has been widely used in listwise LTR methods.

These approaches fall into the traditional supervised learning framework where the algorithm trains on labeled data from the target task. In this paper. we propose a new zero-shot transfer learning framework. which first learns representations of items and their NL features by predicting (item. item) correlation graphs as an auxiliary task. followed by transferring learned representations to solve the target task (query-to-item prediction). without having seen any (query. item) pairs in training. The advantages of applying this new framework include:(1) Cold-starting search and recommenders without abundant query-item data;(2) Generalizing to previously unseen or rare (query. item) pairs and alleviating the"" rich get richer"" problem;(3) Transferring knowledge of (item. item) correlation from domains outside of search.

7571,The Dynamics of Signal Propagation in Gated Recurrent Neural Networks,2019,Dar Gilboa and Bo Chang and Minmin Chen and Greg Yang and Samuel S Schoenholz and Ed H Chi and Jeffrey Pennington,,,,,,Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on long sequence tasks is plagued with difficulties arising from the exponential explosion or vanishing of signals as they propagate forward or backward through the network. Many techniques have been proposed to ameliorate these issues. including various algorithmic and architectural modifications. Two of the most successful RNN architectures. the LSTM and the GRU. do exhibit modest improvements over vanilla RNN cells. but they still suffer from instabilities when trained on very long sequences. In this work. we develop a mean field theory of signal propagation in LSTMs and GRUs that enables us to calculate the time scales for signal propagation as well as the spectral properties of the state-to-state Jacobians. By optimizing these quantities in terms of the initialization hyperparameters. we derive a novel initialization scheme that eliminates or reduces training instabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our initialization scheme on multiple sequence tasks. on which it enables successful training while a standard initialization either fails completely or is orders of magnitude slower. We also observe a beneficial effect on generalization performance using this new initialization.,True,VuWl-KUAAAAJ:pgiGeGwzGf8C,0,https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1g490VKvB,,,,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1g490VKvB,0

The system faces many real-world challenges. including the presence of multiple competing ranking objectives. as well as implicit selection biases in user feedback. To tackle these challenges. we explored a variety of soft-parameter sharing techniques such as Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts so as to efficiently optimize for multiple ranking objectives.

In this paper. we explore the relationship between user commenting behavior and how that might or might not be predictive of video consumption patterns such as watch time. Contrary to recent findings. we found that video watch time is correlated with the positive sentiment expressed in the comments of YouTube videos. More precisely. videos with more positive sentiment on average in the comments are more likely to be watched longer; while videos with negative comment sentiment on average are more likely to have shorter watch durations.

We focus on the latter problem of understanding how social annotations affect user behavior.First. in two separate eye-tracking studies. the results show users have a very specific behavioral patterns when paying attention to the social annotations.

7599,Web Analysis Tools Based on InfoScent™: How Cognitive Modelling Explain Reader Navigational Decisions,2006,Ed H Chi,,,,89-104,Brill,Cognitive behavioural theories of how people make navigational decisions can greatly inform writers of Web content. We have been working for the past five years on modelling user actions on the Web. Our work has shown that a great deal of information about user actions can be recovered from the informational cues processed by the user during navigation.

Rich Web logs provide companies with data about their online visitors and prospective customers. allowing microsegmentation and personalized interactions. While Web mining as a domain is several years old. the challenges that characterize data analysis in this area continue to be formidable. Though p- processing data routinely takes up a major part of the e?ort in data mining.

The invention of the VisiCalc numerical spreadsheet in 1979 enabled ordinary computer users to handle complex mathematical and statistical analysis and fueled the adoption of personal computers. Spreadsheets have proven to be highly successful tools for interacting with numerical data with numerous advantages. Users can easily organize large groups of numbers in cells arranged in tabular form. apply algebraic operations to cells. manipulating rows and columns of data simultaneously. Users can directly manipulate the numbers. Spreadsheets is useful as an end-user programming tool. especially in enabling user to define data dependencies and kept up-to-date automatically.

This is useful because implementers can quickly identify various techniques that can be applied to their domain of interest. However. these taxonomies do not help the implementers understand how to apply and implement these techniques. In this paper. we will extend and then propose a new way to taxonomize information visualization techniques by using the Data State Model/Chi08). In fact. as the taxonomic analysis in this paper will show. many of the techniques share similar operating steps that can easily be reused. The paper shows that the Data State Model not only helps researchers understand the space of design. but also helps implementers understand how information visualization techniques can be applied more broadly.,True,VuWl-KUAAAAJ:c6chOJGeGucC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10533039596959197227&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

7612,Multi-Modal Information Access,1999,Francine Chen,,1999 Symposium on Document Image Understanding Technology,,263,,"At Xerox PARC. we are investigating methods for combining richer."" multi-modal"" features to help users satisfy their information need. At one end of the spectrum. this involves identifying documents or passages of interest. providing simple. rapid access to information pertinent to a user's needs. At the other end. this involves examining a collection of documents to identify underlying structure and relationships.In our models we envision that analogous to a database with various. fields. the documents and passages in the collection are characterized by many different features. such as user information. analysis of text content to determine genre. or analysis of images. One of the difficulties in employing a heterogeneous set of multi-modal features is assigning weights to the importance of different features. In traditional systems that employ metadata. the metadata usually has finite. discrete values and a boolean system that includes or excludes particular values is used to identify data elements of interest. Extending the concept to multi-modal features that may not be discrete leads the question of how to combine the features. We have been developing two different methods of combining multi-modal features. each tailored to the application: 1) providing different views of a collection through multi-modal clustering and 2) helping a user to identify documents of interest in a system called multi-modal scatter/gather. In the first application. the features are considered simultaneously and the task is organization and analysis of a document collection.

In this paper. we focus on how well fairness composes over multiple components in real systems. We consider two recently proposed fairness metrics for rankings: exposure and pairwise ranking accuracy gap. We provide theory that demonstrates a set of conditions under which fairness of individual models does compose.

7639,Assessing acceptance of assistive social agent technology by older adults: the almere model,2010,Marcel Heerink and Ben Kröse and Vanessa Evers and Bob Wielinga,2,International journal of social robotics,4,361-375,Springer Netherlands,This paper proposes a model of technology acceptance that is specifically developed to test the acceptance of assistive social agents by elderly users. The research in this paper develops and tests an adaptation and theoretical extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by explaining intent to use not only in terms of variables related to functional evaluation like perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. but also variables that relate to social interaction. The new model was tested using controlled experiment and longitudinal data collected regarding three different social agents at elderly care facilities and at the homes of older adults. The model was strongly supported accounting for 59–79% of the variance in usage intentions and 49–59% of the variance in actual use. These findings contribute to our understanding of how elderly users accept assistive social agents.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,592,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12369-010-0068-5,8515993573311761413,/scholar?cites=8515993573311761413,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12369-010-0068-5.pdf,0

User-adaptive art recommender systems aim to present their users with art content tailored to their interests. These systems try to adapt to the user based on feedback from the user on which artworks he or she finds interesting. Users need to be able to depend on the system to competently adapt to their feedback and find the artworks that are most interesting to them. This paper investigates the influence of transparency on user trust in and acceptance of content-based recommender systems.

MA,In order for global software to be marketed successfully. the design of interfaces should accommodate users’ cultural differences. This study examines users’ culturally specific design preferences. and evaluates the attitudinal and behavioural consequences of satisfying or not satisfying such preferences. Participants consist of 206 international students. plus a control group of 38 Australian students. Results indicate that design preferences do affect interface acceptance. but that the path of influence leading from preference to attitude and behaviour varies from culture to culture. In particular. unexpected differences are noted between Chinese and Indonesian subjects.

But what personality do they want robots to have? Previous research has found support for two contradicting theories: similarity attraction and complementary attraction. The similarity attraction theory implies that people prefer a robot with a similar personality to their own (e.g.. an extroverted person prefers an extroverted robot). According to the complementary attraction theory. people prefer a robot's personality opposite to their own (e.g.. extroverted people prefer an introverted robot). In contrast to both theories. we argue that what is considered an appropriate personality for a robot depends on the task context.

This paper describes our research on the influence of these abilities on elderly user’s acceptance of such a system. Experiments were set up in eldercare institutions where a robotic and screen agent with simulated conversational capabilities were used in a Wizard of Oz experiment. Both agents were used with two conditions: a more socially communicative (the agent made use of a larger set of social abilities in interaction) and a less socially communicative interface. Results show that participants who were confronted with the more socially communicative version of the robotic agent felt more comfortable and were more expressive in communicating with it. This suggests that the more socially communicative condition would be more likely to be accepted as a conversational partner. This effect was less strong however. with the screen agent. suggesting that embodiment plays a role in this. Furthermore. results did show a correlation between social abilities as perceived by participants and some aspects of technology acceptance for both systems. but this did not relate to the more and less socially communicative conditions. Evaluating the experiments and specifically the use of our acceptance model we suggest that this particular context of robotic and screen agents for elderly users requires the development of a more appropriate acceptance model which not only features technology acceptance. but also conversational acceptance.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,40,https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.14236/ewic/HCI2009.54,13404947751334801884,/scholar?cites=13404947751334801884,,https://www.scienceopen.com/document_file/310a470a-af7e-4a5c-a012-7ec08acd407f/ScienceOpen/430_Heerink.pdf,0

The objective of a special issue on this topic is to further our understanding of these issues and lead to practical recommendations for people researching and implementing HCI from an explicit local and/or indigenous perspective. Translating local knowledge into valid and useful HCI tools is not a simple problem. but one that requires redefining and renegotiating disciplinary boundaries (and connections) and the subject and object of the interaction design. Focusing on local or indigenous awareness and practices in design pushes the envelope in a very exciting way.

If it occurs however. this could mean that the artificial personality is accepted as a conversation partner by the user. An experiment with a robot and a screen agent in an eldercare institution both in a more and less expressive condition shows that it occurs: participants showed indeed more expressiveness with a more expressive robot or agent. The effect seemed to be stronger for the robot.

For the effectiveness of collaboration and crisis fighting it is essential that all actors have access to relevant information necessary for their tasks. Managing the information flow. ie presenting the right information to the right person at the right time. is of great importance. However. the complexity of a crisis event makes it very difficult to keep an overview of all ongoing activities and information flow within the entire crisis environment. In this paper we address the problem of selecting and distributing information to users as a function of their characteristics. tasks and the state of their workflows in a collaborative setting. In particular. we propose a trainable system for information distribution that will be able to support the dynamic nature of collaborative processes and provide users with task-relevant information.

Berlin. Heidelberg,This paper reports the first step in a series of studies to design the interaction behaviors of an outdoor robotic guide. We describe and report the use case development carried out to identify effective human tour guide behaviors. In this paper we focus on non-verbal communication cues in gaze. gestures and movements. The work reported involves the observation of human tour guide behaviors and visitor responses as well as interviews with guides. An affinity diagram is used to identify effective communication cues of human guides and the relations between them. The opportunities for a robotic guide are discussed.

In this paper. we take this challenge to new extremes by attempting to robustly track people in a 360-degree field around the robot in very crowded environments like a busy airport terminal. As a first contribution. we present a novel multimodal people tracking framework that is modular. flexible and fully integrated with ROS. We believe that our framework can be of great benefit to researchers as it covers the entire people tracking pipeline. including powerful visualization and evaluation tools. Secondly. we present a number of simple extensions that can make tracking in crowded scenarios more robust. Finally. we compare our tracking method against a complex multi-hypothesis tracking system. Our results on real and synthetic data suggest that it is not the choice of data association which has the largest impact. but the underlying models that. for instance. control track initiation. deletion. and handling of occlusions. By showing that the simpler data association may be sufficient. we provide reasoning why the available resources on a resource-constrained mobile robot might be better spent on other tasks such as higher-level perception and reasoning.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C,9,http://srl.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publicationsdir/linderGirrbachIROSWS15.pdf,14173543846107692572,/scholar?cites=14173543846107692572,,http://srl.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publicationsdir/linderGirrbachIROSWS15.pdf,0

In Human-Robot Interaction. as well as in Human-Agent Interaction research. the attribution of personality traits towards intelligent agents has already been researched intensively in terms of the social similarity or complementary rule. These two rules imply that humans either tend to like others with similar personality traits or complementary personality traits more. Even though state of the art literature suggests that similarity attraction happens for virtual agents. and complementary attraction for robots. there are many contradictions in the findings. We assume that searching the explanation for personality trait attribution in the similarity and complementary rule does not take into account important contextual factors. Just like people equate certain personality types to certain professions. we expect that people may have certain personality expectations depending on the context of the task the robot carries out. Because professions have different social meaning in different national culture. we also expect that these task-dependent personality preferences differ across cultures.

For the effectiveness of collaboration and crisis fighting it is essential that all actors have access to relevant information necessary for their tasks. Managing the information flow. ie presenting the right information to the right person at the right time. is of great importance. However. the complexity of a crisis event makes it very difficult to keep an overview of all ongoing activities and information flow within the entire crisis environment.

More and more. designers look towards robots and other social agents as viable educational tools. To gain inspiration for the design of meaningful behaviours for such educational social robots we conducted a contextual analysis. We observed a total of 22 primary school children working in pairs on a collaborative inquiry learning assignment in a real world situation at school. During content analysis we identified a rich repertoire of social interactions and behaviours. which we aligned along three types of interaction: (1) Educational.

However. designing deliberate robot behaviour aimed at engaging autistic children remains challenging. Our current understanding of what interactions with a robot. or facilitated by a robot. are particularly motivating to autistic children is limited to qualitative reports with small sample sizes. Translating insights from these reports to design is difficult due to the large individual differences among autistic children in their needs. interests. and abilities. To address these issues. we conducted a descriptive study and report on an analysis of how 31 autistic children spontaneously interacted with a humanoid robot and an adult within the context of a robot-assisted intervention. as well as which individual characteristics were associated with the observed interactions.

During the study a remote-controlled robot gave short guided tours and explained some points of interest in the hall of Festivities in the Royal Alcázar in Seville (Spain). To get insight into visitors’ reactions to the robot’s non-verbal orientation behaviour. two orientations of the robot were tested; either the robot was oriented with its front towards the visitors. or the robot was oriented with its front towards the point of interest. From the study we learned that people reacted strongly to the orientation of the robot. We found that visitors tended to follow the robot tour guide from a greater distance (more than 3 meters away from the robot) more frequently when the robot was oriented towards the visitors than when it was oriented towards the point of interest. Further. when the robot was oriented towards the point of interest. people knew where to look and walked towards the robot more often. On the other hand. people also lost interest in the robot more often when it was oriented towards the point of interest.

In our project we are interested in the acceptance of robotic technology by elders and particularly in the influence of a robots social abilities on acceptance. Several studies on interaction with robots stress the importance of social intelligence and even more so in a health- and eldercare environment. It shows a more social intelligent robot will be more effective in its communication and it can therefore be expected to be easier and more pleasant to interact with and therefore would be indeed accepted easier.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC,5,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4651232/,15245746664746437826,/scholar?cites=15245746664746437826,,,0

Two experiments were conducted with 22 older adults (63 to 87 years old) in a home-like room of the Experience-Lab of Philips. The aim of the first experiment was to test the effect of user-robot personality matching on the acceptance by elderly of a robot that provides agenda and medication reminders. The second experiment explored the mechanism behind robot personality preferences. The results of the first experiment show that the perceived sociability was significantly higher for the extravert robot compared to the introvert robot(p<.05). Sociability is the most prominent characteristic of extraverted people (Tapus & Matari. 2008). Therefore. we concluded that the designed personalities were recognized. In line with previous studies we found that the feeling of social presence (p<.05) and the perceived enjoyability (p<.01) were higher for the extravert robot compared to the introvert robot. Contrary to our expectations. results indicated marginally significant more anxiety for the robot with a similar extraversion level compared to a robot with a complementary extraversion level. On the other hand. the results of our second experiment indicate that similarity attraction influenced the preferred personality of participants. The reasons that participants provided for their robot personality preference suggest that the role that participants believe the robot should have (e.g. a companion or a service oriented machine) and the appreciation of expressed self-confidence influenced their robot personality …,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC,4,http://essay.utwente.nl/61971/,11002755411636305878,/scholar?cites=11002755411636305878,,http://essay.utwente.nl/61971/1/EffectPersonalityMatchingOnRobotAcceptance_1482012.pdf,0

This subjective way of estimating one's exercise intensity by talking (i.e. the Talk Test) motivated us to investigate how speech characteristics are affected during running and whether it is possible to develop a more objective way of estimating exercise intensity levels while running through voice analysis. To this end. we developed the Talk & Run Speech database that contains speech recorded from people before. during. and after running.

Two experiments were conducted with 22 older adults (63 to 87 years old) in a home-like room of the Experience-Lab of Philips. The aim of the first experiment was to test the effect of user-robot personality matching on the acceptance by elderly of a robot that provides agenda and medication reminders. The second experiment explored the mechanism behind robot personality preferences. The results of the first experiment show that the perceived sociability was significantly higher for the extravert robot compared to the introvert robot (p<. 05). Sociability is the most prominent characteristic of extraverted people (Tapus & Matari. 2008). Therefore. we concluded that the designed personalities were recognized. In line with previous studies we found that the feeling of social presence (p<. 05) and the perceived enjoyability (p<. 01) were higher for the extravert robot compared to the introvert robot. Contrary to our expectations. results indicated marginally significant more anxiety for the robot with a similar extraversion level compared to a robot with a complementary extraversion level. On the other hand. the results of our second experiment indicate that similarity attraction influenced the preferred personality of participants. The reasons that participants provided for their robot personality preference suggest that the role that participants believe the robot should have (eg a companion or a service oriented machine) and the appreciation of expressed self-confidence influenced their robot personality …,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:anf4URPfarAC,3,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.479.9042&rep=rep1&type=pdf,272179182898774181,/scholar?cites=272179182898774181,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.479.9042&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

7787,Mobile Agents in Crisis Situations–Adapting information to User’s Affective State,2010,Ron Kok and Andi Winterboer and HSM Cramer and FCA Groen and V Evers,,Proceedings of the 4th Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction (IHCI’10),,,,Emotion has been found to influence humans’ cognitive information processing and decision-making (Schwarz. 2000). A state of sadness. for example. is accompanied by substantive information processing. with greater attention to detail. whereas people in a happier state tend to process information more heuristically. Mobile applications or services presenting information to users. especially those used primarily in emotionally laden contexts. could adapt information presentation to users’ current emotional state to improve compliance. This paper reports the results of an 2x2 betweensubject survey experiment (N= 91) with affective state (happy vs. sad) and information presentation style (heuristic vs. substantive) as dimensions. The results confirm that participants in a sad affective state are more likely to comply with mobile agents’ advice when information is tailored to a substantive processing style. They base decisions on substantive information and provide longer descriptions. In contrast. people in a happy affective state prefer heuristic information. These findings reinforce the importance of affect-sensitive adaptation. especially for mobile agents in potentially emotionally laden contexts.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,3,http://www.academia.edu/download/37940140/iadiskoketal20101.pdf,2071488111261376101,/scholar?cites=2071488111261376101,,http://www.academia.edu/download/37940140/iadiskoketal20101.pdf,0

In the first study. we explored ways of grouping term suggestions from two different thesauri (TGN and WordNet). The results of the first study suggested that the best organization strategies are different when using different thesaurus. Users found Group organization may be appropriate to organize location names from TGN. while Alphabetical works better for WordNet. We then carried out a follow-up study. where we compared three different organization strategies (Alphabetical. Group and Composite) for location name search tasks.

For example. one child may just observe without engaging at all with others while another child may be interested in both the other children as well as the activity. To develop child-friendly interaction technology such as social robots that can adapt robot behaviours to the social situation of a group of children and facilitate harmonious engagement. we aim to study how we can automatically detect these children’s engagement levels.

A series of usability tests assessed trends in the effectiveness of modelling a robot's facial expressions on realistic facial expressions and of adding peripherals enabling child-led control of emotion learning activities with autistic children. Nineteen autistic children interacted with a small humanoid robot and an adult therapist in several emotion-learning activities that featured realistic facial expressions modelled on either a pre-existing database or live facial mirroring. and that used peripherals (tablets or tangible'squishies') to enable child-led activities. Both types of realistic facial expressions by the robot were less effective than exaggerated expressions. with the mirroring being unintuitive for children.

7805,Detecting Perceived Appropriateness of a Robot’s Social Positioning Behavior from Non-Verbal Cues:‘A robot study in scarlet’,2019,JH Vroon and Gwenn Englebienne and Vanessa Evers,,The First IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Machine Intelligence,,,IEEE,What if a robot could detect when you think it got too close to you during its approach? This would allow it to correct or compensate for its social ‘mistake’. It would also allow for a responsive approach. where that robot would reactively find suitable approach behavior through and during the interaction. We investigated if it is possible to automatically detect such social feedback cues in the context of a robot approaching a person. We collected a dataset in which our robot would repeatedly approach people (n= 30) to verbally deliver a message. Approach distance and environmental noise were manipulated. and our participants were tracked (position and orientation of upper body and head). We evaluated their perception of the robot’s behavior through questionnaires and found no single or joint effects of the manipulations. This showed that. in this case. personal differences are more important than contextual cues–thus highlighting the importance of responding to behavioral feedback. This dataset is being made publicly available as part of this publication (http://doi. org/10.4121/uuid: b76c3a6f-f7d5-418e-874a-d6140853e1fa). On this dataset. we then trained a random forest classifier to infer people’s perception of the robot’s approach behavior from features generated from the response behaviors. This resulted in a set of relevant features that perform significantly better than chance for a participant-dependent classifier; which implies that the behaviors of our participants. even with our relatively limited tracking. contain interpretable information about their perception of the robot’s behavior. Our findings demonstrate. for this specific context. that the …,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC,1,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:f47717cc-3724-48ac-9589-fbf48fa4245f,14976887130738382725,/scholar?cites=14976887130738382725,,,0

Engagement has been linked to speech behaviour. pose behaviour and emotional states. However. only recently it has become more feasible and reliable to extract pose and emotion information automatically. Hence. we propose a ranking approach to engagement that utilises vocal features. deep pose features. and emotional states. For emotion detection. we develop a speech based emotion recognition model by aggregating six large but diverse corpora and adopting deep multi-task learning. For deep pose features. skeleton poses are estimated from a single RGB image using a special convolutional neural network architecture.

Robots are expected to interpret people’s behaviors as well as generate meaningful social behaviors in order to seamlessly integrate into the inherently social fabric of human society. The current special issue focuses on the associations between robots and humans and aims to foster discussion on the development of computational models. robotic embodiments. and behaviors that enable robots to act socially. It presents novel research on the impact that robots have on people and their social and physical environment. The investigation of associations between people and robots requires social interpretation when robot gestures and body movements influence ascription of anthropomorphism and likeability of robots. as is the case for the first paper of this special issue “To Err is Human (-like): Effects of …,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC,0,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12369-013-0203-1.pdf,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12369-013-0203-1.pdf,0

This involved a data elicitation study (N= 429) to collect people’s olfactory associations when exposed to nine sample odors. Based on these associations. we then developed a multimodal interface that offered textual. image or combined cues to augment subjects’ odor perception. and 190 new subjects used the interface to identify odors. We found that participants’ smell identification performance increased when the interface offered visual (image and/or text) cues for odor identification. Furthermore. participants experienced the combination of visual and textual cues as most useful and enjoyable. The results of this experiment show that human smell perception can be successfully enhanced with the help of an adaptive odor cue interface.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.955.6133&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.955.6133&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

7840,Classification of a Set of Human Smell Descriptions,2010,Tiko Schep,,,,,,This thesis is about a classification system. that can determine the probabilities of possible smells. given a set of smell descriptions. These descriptions are the result of an experiment done with humans. where they were. amongst other things. asked to answer a set of questions by rating them from 1 to 7 how much the smell they perceived applied to them. The classification system can be used to help the Diadem project to form hypothesis about what is causing a smell annoyance in a residential area. For the classification the assumption is made that the answers of people are independent of one another. so that Naïve Bayes Theorem can be applied. The classification system uses multiple smell descriptions of humans at once. because it is believes that a single human being is highly unreliable when it comes to describing a smell. The classification system that is the result of this thesis is considered to be a successful classifier. with even higher expectations if more aspects are considered.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC,0,https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/b.bredeweg/pdf/BSc/20092010/Schep.pdf,,,,https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/b.bredeweg/pdf/BSc/20092010/Schep.pdf,0

User-adaptive art recommender systems aim to present their users with art content tailored to their interests. These systems try to adapt to the user based on feedback from the user on which artworks he or she finds interesting. Users need to be able to depend on the system to competently adapt to their feedback and find the artworks that are most interesting to them. This chapter investigates the influence of transparency on user trust in and acceptance of content-based recommender systems. A between-subject experiment (N= 60) evaluated interaction with three versions of a content-based art recommender in the cultural heritage domain. This recommender system provides users with artworks that are of interest to them. based on their ratings of other artworks. Version 1 was not transparent. version 2 explained to the user why a recommendation had been made and version 3 showed a rating of how certain the system was that a recommendation would be of interest to the user. Results show that explaining to the user why a recommendation was made increased acceptance of the recommendations. Trust in the system itself was not improved by transparency.

It is not yet clear to what extent people respond to agents’ social behaviours. One example is touch. Despite robots’ embodiment and increasing autonomy. the effect of communicative touch has been a mostly overlooked aspect of humanrobot interaction. This video-based. 2x2 betweensubject survey experiment (N= 119) found that the combination of touch and proactivity influenced whether people saw the robot as machinelike and dependable. Participants’ attitude towards robots in general also influenced perceived closeness between humans and robots. Results show that communicative touch is considered a more appropriate behaviour for proactive agents rather than reactive agents. Also. people that are generally more positive towards robots find robots that interact by touch less machine-like. These effects illustrate that careful consideration is necessary when incorporating social behaviours in agents’ physical interaction design.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190038758.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190038758.pdf,0

In this paper. we describe two user studies that shows some types of organization strategies help users search faster and easier in a known-item search task. We studied the effect of grouping suggestions in an autocompletion interface to select terms taken from a thesaurus. In the first study. we explored ways of grouping term suggestions from two different thesauri (TGN and WordNet). The results of the first study suggested that the best organization strategies are different when using different thesaurus. Users found Group organization may be appropriate to organize location names from TGN. while Alphabetical works better for WordNet. We then carried out a follow-up study. where we compared three different organization strategies (Alphabetical. Group and Composite) for location name search tasks. The results of the second study indicate that in general. autocompletion interfaces help improve the quality of keyword. We also found that Group and Composite organization help users search faster. and users perceive the suggestion organization as easier to understand and use than the Alphabetical.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.217.2022&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.217.2022&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

7854,Usability Evaluation of a Simulated Vascular Reconstruction System,2004,HSM Cramer and V Evers and EV Zudilova and PMA Sloot,,,,,University of Nottingham,In order to ensure successful adoption of Virtual Reality applications. usability and the context in which a system will be used has to be considered in system design and development. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are available for system development (see eg Preece et al.. 2002). This paper focuses on a combination of qualitative methods that have been applied in the development of a prototype of a VR system for medical diagnosis and planning for vascular disorders. the Virtual Radiology Explorer (VRE). In this case. heuristic evaluation was applied to assess usability of the VRE prototype and to improve usability of future versions of the VRE. Besides the application to the VRE. many issues identified in this study pertain to development of virtual reality applications in general.Usefulness of any system largely depends on how user needs for both utility and usability are supported (Grudin. 1992; as quoted by Hilbert & Redmiles. 2000). Both should be taken into account in design and evaluation of a system. For our purposes we comply with the definition of usability as put forward in the ISO 9241-11 (1998) standard: the extent to which a product can be used by specific users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness. efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. The heuristic evaluation did not only result in identification of usability problems of the prototype but also in the realization that a closer look at context of use and desired utility of the system would be necessary in further development.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,0,https://uva.computationalscience.nl/papers/archive/Cramer2004b.pdf,,,,https://uva.computationalscience.nl/papers/archive/Cramer2004b.pdf,0

We report on the development of the instrument and its validation. which adopted a design-based method with two iterations. We used construct validity. which was formed by divergent and convergent validity. Children’s perceptions of three different robotic platforms were examined in two empirical studies with 78 children aged 7–9 years. which was based on semi-structured interviews with qualitative thematic content analysis. The results indicated that children differentiate their perception of social competence depending on the perceived intentionality of the robot and they ascribe discrete categorizations to the robot such as a machine. social artifact and social agent.

7862,Design challenges for long-term interaction with a robot in a science classroom,,Daniel Davison1 Vicky Charisi1 Frances Wijnen and Andrea Papenmeier and Jan van der Meij2 Dennis Reidsma and Vanessa Evers,,,,,,This paper aims to present the main challenges that emerged during the process of the research design of a longitudinal study on child-robot interaction for science education and to discuss relevant suggestions in the context. The theoretical rationale is based on aspects of the theory of social constructivism and we use the collaborative inquiry as a framework to examine children’s learning process who interact with a robotic learning companion. We identify two main challenges;(i) the development of robust on-demand systems for long-term interaction; and (ii) the design of developmentally appropriate scaffolding in embodied. semi-structured learning tasks. To address these challenges. we suggest (i) the development of a system for the detection of child’s intention for interaction in the context of a classroom and (ii) the design of sensorized learning materials for the support of developmentally appropriate embodied learning experience.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC,0,https://research.utwente.nl/files/25718747/v2.1_CAMERA_READY_ro-man2016-workshop.pdf,,,,https://research.utwente.nl/files/25718747/v2.1_CAMERA_READY_ro-man2016-workshop.pdf,0
7863,Automatic ranking of engagement of a group of children “in the wild” using emotional states and deep pose machines,,Jaebok Kim and Ibrahim H Shareef and Peter Regier and Khiet P Truong and Vicky Charisi and Cristina Zaga and Maren Bennewitz and Gwenn Englebienne and Vanessa Evers,,,,,,Due to the complex nature of engagement and the naturalistic and noisy nature of the data. detecting engagement “in the wild” in a group of children remains a challenging task. Engagement has been linked to speech behaviour. pose behaviour and emotional states. However. only recently it has become more feasible and reliable to extract pose and emotion information automatically. Hence. we propose a ranking approach to engagement that utilises vocal features. deep pose features. and emotional states. For emotion detection. we develop a speech based emotion recognition model by aggregating six large but diverse corpora and adopting deep multi-task learning. For deep pose features. skeleton poses are estimated from a single RGB image using a special convolutional neural network architecture. We found that emotional-state-based features perform the best but early fusion or pair-wise loss based feature selection does not improve the performance.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jaebok_Kim/publication/321085662_Automatic_ranking_of_engagement_of_a_group_of_children_in_the_wild_using_emotional_states_and_deep_pose_machines/links/5a0cbaea4585153829b191fb/Automatic-ranking-of-engagement-of-a-group-of-children-in-the-wild-using-emotional-states-and-deep-pose-machines.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jaebok_Kim/publication/321085662_Automatic_ranking_of_engagement_of_a_group_of_children_in_the_wild_using_emotional_states_and_deep_pose_machines/links/5a0cbaea4585153829b191fb/Automatic-ranking-of-engagement-of-a-group-of-children-in-the-wild-using-emotional-states-and-deep-pose-machines.pdf,0
7864,Validating Evaluation Methods for Child Robot Interaction,,Vicky Charisi and Cristina Zaga and Daniel Davison and Frances Wijnen and Jaebok Kim and Dennis Reidsma and Khiet P Truong and Vanessa Evers,,,,,,The proposed interactive child experience is one of the steps towards the validation of our methodological approaches for a user-centered evaluation of child robot interaction. Despite the growing body of relevant research. a discussion is ongoing about the need for novel validated methodological approaches. able to meet the idiosyncratic nature of the field. During this session. the participant children will interact with three different robots. In the first case. the children will engage in a participatory design experience; they will co-design the behaviours of a non-anthropomorphic robot in a play setting. In the second case. the children will interact with an anthropomorphic robot. which will have the role of a learning companion for an inquiry learning activity. In the third case. the children will be given the opportunity to develop elements of computational thinking by programming a non-anthropomorphic robot for a collaborative problem solving activity. In each session. we will evaluate aspects of child-robot interaction using behavioural observation methods. story-telling practices and collecting automatically generated data. In addition. after each session. the children will complete a pictorial task. which will measure the perceived social competence of each robot and its social acceptance.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vicky_Charisi/publication/312172593_Validating_Evaluation_Methods_for_Child_Robot_Interaction/links/5874838c08ae329d621d47b9/Validating-Evaluation-Methods-for-Child-Robot-Interaction.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vicky_Charisi/publication/312172593_Validating_Evaluation_Methods_for_Child_Robot_Interaction/links/5874838c08ae329d621d47b9/Validating-Evaluation-Methods-for-Child-Robot-Interaction.pdf,0
7865,Automatic ordinal prediction of children’s participation in social play settings using nonverbal vocal features,,Jaebok Kim and Khiet P Truong and Vanessa Evers,,,,,,In social play. young children can exhibit different types of participation. Some children are engaged with other children in the play activity while others are just looking. In this study. we investigated methods to automatically predict the children’s levels of participation in play settings using nonverbal vocal features (which have been shown to correlate with related phenomena such as engagement and dominance). Rather than labelling the level of participation in an absolute manner. as has frequently been done in previous related studies. we designed an annotation scheme that takes the order of children’s participation levels into account. Taking full advantage of the ordered annotations. we explored the use of SVM-based ordinal learning. ie. ordinal regression and ranking. and compared these to a rule-based ranking and a classification method. We found promising performances for the ordinal methods. Particularly. the ranking method demonstrated the most robust performance against the large variation of children and their interactions.,True,f-F4yywAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cbef/6fab701096a40e3945f1744e2c3fc2015f4d.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cbef/6fab701096a40e3945f1744e2c3fc2015f4d.pdf,0

Global warming is believed to be caused by the emissions of greenhouse gases due to human activities including the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from petroleum consumption. Limitations of the previous methods of predicting CO2 emissions and lack of work on the prediction of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) CO2 emissions from petroleum consumption have motivated this research.   Methods/Findings The OPEC CO2 emissions data were collected from the Energy Information Administration. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) adaptability and performance motivated its choice for this study. To improve effectiveness of the ANN. the cuckoo search algorithm was hybridised with accelerated particle swarm optimisation for training the ANN to build a model for the prediction of OPEC CO2 emissions. The proposed model predicts OPEC CO2 emissions for 3. 6. 9. 12 and 16 years with an improved accuracy and speed over the state-of-the-art methods.   Conclusion An accurate prediction of OPEC CO2 emissions can serve as a reference point for propagating the reorganisation of economic development in OPEC member countries with the view of reducing CO2 emissions to Kyoto benchmarks—hence. reducing global warming.

7909,Toward tweets normalization using maximum entropy,2015,Mohammad Arshi Saloot and Norisma Idris and Liyana Shuib and Ram Gopal Raj and AiTi Aw,,,,19-27,,The use of social network services and microblogs. such as Twitter. has created valuable text resources. which contain extremely noisy text. Twitter messages contain so much noise that it is difficult to use them in natural language processing tasks. This paper presents a new approach using the maximum entropy model for normalizing Tweets. The proposed approach addresses words that are unseen in the training phase. Although the maximum entropy needs a training dataset to adjust its parameters. the proposed approach can normalize unseen data in the training set. The principle of maximum entropy emphasizes incorporating the available features into a uniform model. First. we generate a set of normalized candidates for each out-ofvocabulary word based on lexical. phonemic. and morphophonemic similarities. Then. three different probability scores are calculated for each candidate using positional indexing. a dependency-based frequency feature and a language model. After the optimal values of the model parameters are obtained in a training phase. the model can calculate the final probability value for candidates. The approach achieved an 83.12 BLEU score in testing using 2.000 Tweets. Our experimental results show that the maximum entropy approach significantly outperforms previous well-known normalization approaches.,True,-qXTI0QAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,12,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W15-4303.pdf,15684133011341883533,/scholar?cites=15684133011341883533,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W15-4303.pdf,0

Alzheimer. AIDS. cerebral calcinosis. glioma. or metastatic. which helps the radiologists to diagnose the disease in brain MRIs is created. Methods: The performance of the proposed system is validated by using benchmark MRI datasets (OASIS and Harvard) of 310 patients. Master features of the images are extracted using a fast discrete wavelet transform (DWT). then these discriminative features are further analysed by principal component analysis (PCA). Different subset sizes of principal feature vectors are provided to five different decision models. The classification models include the J48 decision tree. k-nearest neighbour (kNN). random forest (RF). and least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) with polynomial and radial basis kernels. Results: The RF-based classifier outperformed among all compared decision models and achieved an average accuracy of 96% with 4% standard deviation. and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 99%. LS-SVM (RBF) also shows promising results (ie. 89% accuracy) when the least number of principal features was used. Furthermore. the performance of each classifier on different subset sizes of principal features was (80%–96%) for most performance metrics. Conclusion: The presented medical decision support system demonstrates the potential proof for accurate multi-class classification of brain abnormalities; therefore. it has a potential to use as a diagnostic tool for the medical practitioners …,True,-qXTI0QAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,11,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/3/37,15028169104264846185,/scholar?cites=15028169104264846185,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/3/37/pdf,0

This study employs text categorization techniques for the classification of open narrative forensic autopsy reports. One of the key steps in text classification is document representation. In document representation. a clinical report is transformed into a format that is suitable for classification. The traditional document representation technique for text categorization is the bag-of-words (BoW) technique. In this study. the traditional BoW technique is ineffective in classifying forensic autopsy reports because it merely extracts frequent but discriminative features from clinical reports. Moreover. this technique fails to capture word inversion. as well as word-level synonymy and polysemy. when classifying autopsy reports.

Total cure for the diabetes is currently not available. In this paper. we proposed diabetes classifier based on the cuckoo search algorithm (CS) and Neural Network (NN). The weights and bias of the NN was trained using the CS to deviate from being stuck in local minima. The high dimension of the features in our dataset triggered the study to extract the critical features using principal component analysis. The extracted features were used to built a classifier based on the NN and the CS for classifying potential diabetes patients. The propose diabetes classifier performance was compared to the classifiers built based on artificial bee colony and genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed approach converges faster to the optimum solution than the comparative classifiers.

One contemporary use of mobile phones is in the education field. commonly known as M-Learning. Subsequent to the growth of M-Learning. developers of educational mobile applications need to understand what the user requirements are. and how to satisfy them. In order to measure user satisfaction while engaging with mobiles as learning tools. many models have been created using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. and other models such as the Technology Acceptance Model. However. none of these has focused on the technical factors affecting the users’ intentions to use their mobile phones as learning tools. Due to technical limitations. as well as human psychology. mobile phone learning remains limited to an assistance-only function. This paper presents a review of studies that have been used to measure users’ intentions of engaging with mobile phones as learning tools. One hundred and twenty-seven papers have been reviewed. dating from 2011 to 2020. These papers differ in terms of methodology and results collected.

7970,Information seeking tool based on learning style/Nor Liyana Binti Mohd Shuib,2013,Mohd Shuib Nor Liyana,,,,,,Learning is enhanced when its activities are aligned with learning style. An integral component of students’ learning activities is searching for and retrieving reading materials. However. it is not always easy to find suitable reading materials that match the students’ needs. This is mainly because most search engines are built with only content in mind. This study investigates students’ learning needs in information seeking. in relation to their learning styles. This involves identifying students’ information seeking behaviour from a literature review and preliminary studies. It was found that the reading materials retrieved using current information seeking tools do not match students’ learning styles. Thus. this research aims to develop an information seeking tool that considers students' learning style within its retrieval process. The development of such a tool requires the reading materials to be classified based on learning style preferences. Primitive elements. such as text. graphs. and diagrams. have been chosen as identifiers for the above classification. An information seeking tool. with learning style consideration. was then proposed. A prototype was developed to map and match reading materials to students’ learning styles. For the evaluation. experiments and surveys were conducted. and the results obtained were then analysed. Our findings show that this new information seeking tool is able to find reading materials that are more closely related to the students’ individual learning styles.,True,-qXTI0QAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,http://studentsrepo.um.edu.my/id/eprint/5605,,,,http://studentsrepo.um.edu.my/5605/1/ThesisLiyana.pdf,0

Ainuddin Wahid Abdul …,,Ghulam Murtaza and Liyana Shuib and Ainuddin Wahid Abdul Wahab and Ghulam Mujtaba and Ghulam Raza,,,,,,Breast cancer (BrC) is the leading cause of abnormal death in women. Mammograms and histopathology (Hp) biopsy images are generally recommended for early diagnosis of BrC because Hp image-based diagnosis enables doctors to make cancer diagnostic decisions more confidently than with mammograms. Several studies have used Hp images to classify BrC. However. the performance of classification models is compromised due to the higher misclassification rate. Therefore. this study aimed to develop a reliable. accurate. and computationally cost-effective ensembled BrCclassification network (EBrC-Net) model with three misclassification algorithms to diagnose breast malignancy in early stages using Hp images. The proposed EBrC-Net model is based on the deep convolutional neural network approach. For experiments. the publicly available BreakHis dataset wasused and split into training. validation. and testing sets. In addition. image augmentation was adopted for the training set only. and features were extracted through the well-trained EBrC-Net. Thereafter. the extracted features were further evaluated by six machine learningclassifiers. of whichtwo best performing classifiers (ie. softmax and k-nearest neighbour [kNN]) were selected on the basis of five performance metric evaluation results. Furthermore. three misclassification reduction (McR) algorithms were developed and implemented in cascaded manner to reduce the false predictions of thesoftmax and kNN classifiers. After the implementation of the McR algorithms. experiments showed that the kNN results were much better and reliable than the softmax.

Different sets of youths seek information differently and this paper reports on the information seeking behaviour using social media by young international students engaged in a student exchange programme. The paper’s objective is to investigate information seeking behaviour activities on social media. a phenomenon that is currently under-researched and propose a new model for information seeking on social media. The research was conducted qualitatively based on the Inbound Student Exchange Programme organised by the University of Malaya. Malaysia. Twenty students from two universities in China and seven students from an Indonesian university were interviewed held in their respective universities. The findings show that students exercise information seeking behavioural activities that can be grouped into three classifications: planning. executing. and extending. These information seeking behavioural activities formed the basis of a new information seeking model on social media proposed in this paper. This paper contributes towards understanding information seeking behaviour on social media and attempts to produce a new model which updates the existing information seeking behaviour models.,True,-qXTI0QAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC,0,https://umexpert.um.edu.my/public_view.php?type=publication&row=NzkzNjE%3D,,,,https://umexpert.um.edu.my/public_view.php?type=publication&row=NzkzNjE%3D,0
7976,EVIDENCE OF STUDENTS GAMING THE SYSTEM AND GOING OFF-TASK IN AN INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM,,Shamsheer Jauhangeer and Liyana Shuib and Zati Azizul Hasan,,,,,,In recent years. there has been a growing interest in how students “game the system” and go “off-task” in online learning environments. On one hand. students game the system by clicking through hints. feedbacks to get quickly to the answer instead of learning the material. On the other hand. students engage in other activities that are not related to the learning task. such as; surfing the web. off-task conversation. off-task solitary behaviour and inactivity. This cause poor performance and poor learning. In this study. we conducted an experiment to test two intelligent tutors; a cognitive arithmetic tutor and a metacognitive arithmetic tutor developed in an Intelligent Tutoring System. The experiment was logged and the researchers overlooked the session with observation. We present evidence of how students interacted with the system during the experiment. The results show that some of the students have indeed gamed the system and went off-task. We show that gaming the system has a detrimental impact on the purpose of the system and that off-task behaviours adversely affect leaning.,True,-qXTI0QAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shamsheer_Jauhangeer/publication/338335160_Research_Paper_EVIDENCE_OF_STUDENTS_GAMING_THE_SYSTEM_AND_GOING_OFF-TASK_IN_AN_INTELLIGENT_TUTORING_SYSTEM/links/5e0d5b114585159aa4ab68cd/Research-Paper-EVIDENCE-OF-STUDENTS-GAMING-THE-SYSTEM-AND-GOING-OFF-TASK-IN-AN-INTELLIGENT-TUTORING-SYSTEM.pdf,,,,,0

7979,Design of an Algebraic Concept Operator for Adaptive Feedback in Physics⋆,,Bimba Andrew Thomas and Norisma Idris and Ahmed A Al-Hunaiyyan and Rohana Binti Mahmud and Nor Liyana Bt Mohd Shuib,,,,,,In an adaptive learning environment. the feedback provided during problem-solving requires a means. target. goal. and strategy. One of the challenges of representing feedback to meet these criteria. is the representation of the effect of multiple concepts on a single concept. Currently. most of the methods (linguistic knowledge base. expert knowledge base. and ontology) used in representing knowledge in an adaptive learning environment only provide relationships between a pair of concept. However. a cognitive knowledge base which represents a concept as an object. attribute. and relations (OAR) model. provides a means to determine the effect of multiple concepts on a single concept. Using the OAR model. the relationships between multiple pedagogical. domain. and student attributes are represented for providing adaptive feedback. Most researchers have proposed adaptive feedback methods that are not fully grounded in pedagogical principles. In addition. the three knowledge components of the learning environment (pedagogical. domain and student models) are mostly treated in isolation. A reason for this could be the complex nature of representing multiple adaptive feedback characteristics across the main components of a learning environment. Thus. there is a need to design a concept operator that can relate the three facets of knowledge in an adaptive learning environment. Using the algebraic concept operator Rin i. the effect of multiple attributes of the three knowledge components on the student’s performance is represented.

Total cure for the diabetes is currently not available. In this paper. we proposed diabetes classifier based on the cuckoo search algorithm (CS) and Neural Network (NN). The weights and bias of the NN was trained using the CS to deviate from being stuck in local minima. The high dimension of the features in our dataset triggered the study to extract the critical features using principal component analysis. The extracted features were used to built a classifier based on the NN and the CS for classifying potential diabetes patients. The propose diabetes classifier performance was compared to the classifiers built based on artificial bee colony and genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed approach converges faster to the optimum solution than the comparative classifiers. Comparative study of the approach proposed and previous methods. further proved the effectiveness of our method.

7982,Hybrid of Artificial Bee Colony and Elman Neural Network for the Classification of Learning Style based on Student’s Preferences,,Liyana Shuib and Haruna Chiroma,,,,,,Efforts have been made in recent times by educators and researchers to provide learners with appropriate learning objects (LO) based on their learning style (LS). Previous studies on the classification of LS. typically classify LS based on the description of the LS preference itself without giving attention to the student prefer. This study will present a new knowledge in classifying research material based on learning style. In this study. we propose a hybrid of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Elman Neural Network (ABCENN) to create a classifier for the classification of LS (Diverging. Accommodating. Converging. and Assimilating) based on student preference of teaching strategies (TS) and LO. Our research extends on our previous work which considered only LO without TS. For the purpose of comparison. hybrid ABC and backpropagation neural network (ABCBP) and Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) were applied to classify the LS of learners. Simulation results indicated that the propose ABCENN classifier outperforms ABCBPNN. and BPNN classifiers with an accuracy of 97.12% and converge faster than the comparison methods. The propose ABCENN of this research can offer valuable information for educators. school administrators. and researchers to reach a decision on their respective students and to appropriately adapt their teaching methods.

They have much higher accuracy requirements. since movements are less constrained in open places. and alternatives like alleys in an old town centre are in closer proximity. Location-based tourism information systems like tour guides are designed to provide context-driven interpretation of sights situated in the immediate vicinity. Current pedestrian navigation systems exclusively rely on GPS assisted by a map for localization. Hard to reproduce anecdotal evidence suggests that pedestrian navigators have difficulty to provide accurate navigational guidance. This paper examines the actual accuracy of positioning for various GPS receivers in areas of the city of Görlitz relevant to a tourist. These measurements are based on a comparison between a dense network of reference points of known locations and the estimated positions provided by the GPS receivers. The error of GPS localization is largely determined by the interaction of the current constellation of GPS satellites and the built-up in the immediate proximity. Since the constellation changes constantly the localization error of the same position varies significantly over time. A fraction of the error is reproducible and can therefore be used to correct the position estimate. The error along the street or alley is much smaller than the orthogonal error. This is of strategic importance for the design of mobile information systems targeting a tourist with interpretive information.,True,HINV9ZIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,184,http://modsching.com/papers/FieldtrialonGPSAccuracy10pages2006-02-10_06crcit.pdf,1348648794228259698,/scholar?cites=1348648794228259698,,http://modsching.com/papers/FieldtrialonGPSAccuracy10pages2006-02-10_06crcit.pdf,0

This method was applied during a field study in the city of Görlitz at the east border of Germany. Based on Global Positioning System (GPS) logs the spatial distribution of visitors in various areas is visualized and analyzed. Using the bimodality of the distribution of walking speeds. areas of slowdown are identified and subsequently clustered into activity areas.

But handling mobile devices marks a big challenge for ordinary users. The acceptance and usability of such a mobile tour recommender can only be evaluated when utilized by the intended user group itself - real tourists. In afield trial in Gorlitz (Germany). 421 tourists explored the city with one of two different mobile information systems. a proactive recommender of personalized tours and a pull service presenting context-based information on demand. A third group of tourists was tracked by GPS receivers during their exploration of the destination relying on traditional means of information.

Therefore during the whole design process the speed and area of a unit are precisely known.

Therefore the efficiency of top-down design is increased signiﬁcantly by generic design. where each entity is parameterised persistently. In a design project with three different ASICs.

8032,Evaluating different preference elicitation methods for a mobile recommender system in a field trial,2006,Ronny Kramer and Marko Modsching and Klaus ten Hagen and Ulrike Gretzel,,ECAI 2006 Workshop on Recommender Systems,,97,,Recommender systems offer product advice or information users might be interested in. In the tourism sector information needs are directed towards sights and restaurants. Today’s agent technology provides the opportunity for intelligent tour recommenders to organise a personal walking tour and to provide user specific guidance and interpretation to create an individualized experience. This is the main objective of the Dynamic Tour Guide (DTG.[16])-a mobile agent that elicits personal generic preferences. selects attractions. plans individual tours. provides navigational guidance and offers location based interpretation via a mobile device. But intelligent recommendation deliveries require knowledge about the user’s interests. A field trial served to evaluate methods for the elicitation of generic preferences and to reason about their general necessity by defining the following research targets: Is it possible to seed generic interest profiles that allow the accurate prediction of rankings of concrete sights? And are these profiles sufficiently diverse to make personalised tours based on individual interests a real improvement towards standard tours? The results suggest that ranking of simple categories constitutes the most effective means of capturing user preferences using a mobile device and that standard tours would not adequately represent the wide array of interest profiles identified.,True,HINV9ZIAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/30843243/10.1.1.69.1870.pdf#page=105,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30843243/10.1.1.69.1870.pdf#page=105,0

Mobile information systems complement more traditional means of information provision. eg printed maps. guide booklets or simply signage at the destination. The most important question is:“How are mobile information systems accepted by ordinary tourists??” In case of a yes the next question is:“How does an information system impacts the visit of the tourists?” These questions were studied in a field study with real tourists in the city of Görlitz in August. A control group received a GPS logger whereas the other two groups received mobile devices with two different mobile information systems. All three groups explored the city on their own. The first mobile application displays the current location of the tourist and attractions in a map. The tourist can request multi-media information about each attraction. The second application elicits the generic preferences of the tourist. ranks the attractions. computes a tour. supports the execution via audio navigation instructions and adapts the tour plan as necessary. For each group some basic data was collected before the tour. eg computer literacy. During the tour the positions and interactions were logged and after the tour a questionnaire gathered additional data. The spatial behaviour and interaction logs was analysed to determine the impact of a mobile information system on the behaviour of tourists during a city tour.,True,HINV9ZIAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,0,https://ro.uow.edu.au/commpapers/2802/,,,,,0

Nevertheless. the attractiveness of a software implementation is still defined by the much smaller abstraction gap between specification and implementation. Whereas. hardware design creates the possibility to exploit parallelism at a very fine level of granularity and thereby achieve tremendous performance gains with a moderate expenditure of hardware. This paper describes the joint design process leading to an ASIC chipset accelerating the execution of rulebased systems. The interaction between the algorithm used for software implementation and the parallel algorithm suited for hardware implementation is examined. An area efficient implementation of the programmable hardware was enabled by an application specific compiler backend.

8045,(SI. ICS) Implizite Modellierung des Kontrollzustands: Herleitung,1995,Klaus ten Hagen,,,,213-235,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Der Kontrollzustand einer EFSM ist bisher als eine Variable explizit modelliert worden. Zustandsübergänge wurden durch eine Wertzuweisung beschrieben. Durch die Verwendung von mehreren „wait“:-Anweisungen auf die ausgezeichnete Taktflanke kann der Kontrollzustand implizit modelliert werden. Der aktuelle Kontrollzustand wird durch einen Zeiger auf die zuletzt ausgeführte „wait“-Anweisung dargestellt. so daß Zustandsübergänge durch bedingte Verzweigungen beschrieben werden. Der Vergleich der ex- und impliziten Zustandsmodellierung an einem Beispiel zeigt. daß die implizite Zustandsmodellierung eine kompaktere Modellierung ermöglicht. Weiterhin können die Operationen eines Algorithmus durch das Einfügen.

Furthermore it consistently supports the execution of the tour by navigational instructions. An individual tour creates the desire to change the tour plan dynamically in order to adapt to external influences or simply spontaneous decisions. Therefore the tour-plan can’t be a static component but has to be adaptable to any changes caused by the behaviour of the tourist. This paper shows the possible reasons that make a tour adaptation necessary and suggests a general solution method for different situations.

In particular. we follow a data-driven approach by collecting data on how people negotiate against an agent using a fixed-response strategy during a task involving the partition of a set of items. We then use different machine learning techniques to: 1) analyze the relationship between negotiation styles and personality traits; 2) characterize changes in the human negotiation behavior during the game; 3) discover human behavior patterns in response to different offers by the agent player. Our analyses show how different personality traits lead to …,True,CwHkgE4AAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC,6,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8273579/,4888487879109462725,/scholar?cites=4888487879109462725,,http://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/home/marsella/publications/,0

We present a simple. portable and editable lip-synchronization method that works for multiple languages. requires no machine learning. can be constructed by a skilled animator. runs in real time. and can be personalized for each character. Our method associates animation curves designed by an animator on a fixed set of static facial poses. with sequential pairs of phonemes (diphones). and then stitch the diphones together to create a set of curves for the facial poses. Diphone-and triphone-based methods have been explored in various previous works [Deng et al. 2006]. often requiring machine learning.

8078,Modeling Game Avatar Synergy and Opposition through Embedding in Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Games,2018,Zhengxing Chen and Yuyu Xu and Truong-Huy D Nguyen and Yizhou Sun and Magy Seif El-Nasr,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.10402,,,,Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games have received increasing worldwide popularity recently. In such games. players compete in teams against each other by controlling selected game avatars. each of which is designed with different strengths and weaknesses. Intuitively. putting together game avatars that complement each other (synergy) and suppress those of opponents (opposition) would result in a stronger team. In-depth understanding of synergy and opposition relationships among game avatars benefits player in making decisions in game avatar drafting and gaining better prediction of match events. However. due to intricate design and complex interactions between game avatars. thorough understanding of their relationships is not a trivial task.In this paper. we propose a latent variable model. namely Game Avatar Embedding (GAE). to learn avatars' numerical representations which encode synergy and opposition relationships between pairs of avatars. The merits of our model are twofold:(1) the captured synergy and opposition relationships are sensible to experienced human players' perception;(2) the learned numerical representations of game avatars allow many important downstream tasks. such as similar avatar search. match outcome prediction. and avatar pick recommender. To our best knowledge. no previous model is able to simultaneously support both features. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real match data from three commercial MOBA games illustrate the benefits of our model.,True,CwHkgE4AAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10402,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10402,0

8099,How Open Innovation and Information Systems Affect R&D Performance: A Knowledge Sharing Perspective.,2015,Ting-Peng Liang and Deng-Neng Chen and Rajiv Kohli,,,,92,,Open innovation is a paradigm for knowledge sourcing among organizations. Extant literature argues that organizations should take advantage of both external and internal ideas for innovation in organizations. For open innovation to be effective. however. organizations must be able to source knowledge to partners as well absorb the ideas and knowledge from external parties. It is critical to share the knowledge in the organization. and then both the external and internal knowledge can be applied to help the business. We argue that information systems (IS) play a key role in assimilation of knowledge and are critical to adoption of open innovation. In this research. we investigate how IS can facilitate the adoption of open innovations and knowledge sharing. and whether knowledge sharing affects organizational research and development (R&D) performance.

However. we lack knowledge about the underlying mechanisms for how the different aspects of KMS-based knowledge-creation process (ie. socialization. externalization. combination. and internalization) enhance organizational creativity and. ultimately. organizational performance. We examine organizational agility’s role as a mediator between knowledge creation and organizational creativity and the subsequent effect that creativity has on organizational performance. We also analyze the moderating roles of two key knowledge characteristics. tacitness and institutionalization. in the mediation processes. We found that organizational agility mediated the effect that knowledge creation had on organizational creativity. Moreover. knowledge tacitness moderated the effect that socialization had on organizational creativity.

When the data is accessed across clusters the data latency time has significant impact on the performance. In the literature it is given that memory and I/O have become the new bottleneck. instead of processing power in achieving efficient load balance at higher performance for cluster computer systems. Initial job placement and load balancing are the key aspects affecting the performance. The proposed technique combines data access patterns. memory and CPU utilization and locality of memory to consider as load metric in the load balancing aspect across cluster. A scheduling algorithm based on this metric has been proposed to dynamically balance the load in the cluster. Initial job placement for a job in the cluster considers data access patterns and for load balance aspect metric constitutes CPU. memory utilization including locality of memory.

Moreover. users are quiet dependent on the average ratings of the products showcased in the marketing interface in turn these average ratings made remarkable impact on sales phenomena of the product. The average rating of a product is the aggregation of individual users ratings biased with the tendency of the user towards publishing the opinion. The optimistic user tends to give a slight high rating than a neutral judgement and vice versa with a pessimistic user. However. these biased ratings produce an aggregate value that is degraded with its trustworthiness. This paper proposed a novel approach named DBT (De-biased Tendency) Recommender to analyze the bias in product rating which recalculates the average ratings of the products by making user tendencies as part of the process.

Les labels peuvent donc avoir à la fois des relations d'ordre et de co-occurrence. D'un côté. le fait d'ignorer les relations entre les labels risque d'aboutir à des prédictions incohérentes. et d'un autre côté. le fait de prendre en compte ces relations risque de propager l'erreur de prédiction d'un label à tous les labels qui lui sont reliés. Les approches de l'état d'art permettent soit d'ignorer les relations entre les labels. soit d'apprendre uniquement les relations correspondant à une structure de dépendance figée. L'approche que nous proposons permet l'apprentissage des relations entre les labels sans fixer une structure de dépendance au préalable.

8147,A distributed graph based approach for rough classifications considering dominance relations between overlapping classes,2015,Khalil Laghmari and Mohammed Ramdani and Christophe Marsala,,,,1-6,IEEE,Several data from real world applications involves overlapping classes. Data is allowed to belong to multiple classes with different membership degrees. In this paper. we explore a different concept characterizing social networks. documents. and most of biological and chemical datasets: data could have multiple classes. but dominant classes are better noticed than dominated classes. For example. a document could discuss economy and politics. but it would be more focused on politics. A molecule could have multiple odors. but experts could notice some odors better than others. We are interested in this type of data. where a dominance relation exists between classes. Experts could easily make mistakes because dominated classes are hardly noticed. Data incoherence is a serious problem but not the only one. There is too much irrelevant and redundant attributes.

8148,A Distributed Recommender System Based on Graded Multi-label Classification,2017,Khalil Laghmari and Christophe Marsala and Mohammed Ramdani,,,,101-108,Springer. Cham,Recommender systems are designed to find items in which each user has most likely the highest interest. Items can be of any type such as commercial products. e-learning resources. movies. songs. and jokes. Successful web and mobile applications can collect easily thousands of users. thousands of items. and millions of item ratings in only few months. A solution to store and to process these continuously growing data is to build distributed recommender systems. The challenging task is to find the appropriate distribution strategy allowing an efficient retrieval of needed information. Considering the similarity between the task of predicting a rating. and the task of predicting a membership grade in graded multi-label classification (GMLC). we propose an adapted distribution strategy to efficiently build a decentralized recommender system based on GMLC.,True,GRgqq1kAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-59647-1_8,2852958122648909008,/scholar?cites=2852958122648909008,,,0
8149,Classification multi-labels graduée: découverte des relations entre les labels. et adaptation à la reconnaissance des odeurs et au contexte big data des systèmes de recommandation,2018,Khalil Laghmari,,,,,,En classification multi-labels graduée (CMLG). chaque instance est associée à un ensemble de labels avec des degrés d’association gradués. Par exemple. une même molécule odorante peut être associée à une odeur forte ‘musquée’. une odeur modérée ‘animale’. et une odeur faible ‘herbacée’. L’objectif est d’apprendre un modèle permettant de prédire l’ensemble gradué de labels associé à une instance à partir de ses variables descriptives. Par exemple. prédire l’ensemble gradué d’odeurs à partir de la masse moléculaire. du nombre de liaisons doubles. et de la structure de la molécule. Un autre domaine intéressant de la CMLG est les systèmes de recommandation. En effet. les appréciations des utilisateurs par rapport à des items (produits. services. livres. films. etc) sont d’abord collectées sous forme de données MLG (l’échelle d’une à cinq étoiles est souvent utilisée). Ces données sont ensuite exploitées pour recommander à chaque utilisateur des items qui ont le plus de chance de l’intéresser. Dans cette thèse. une étude théorique approfondie de la CMLG permet de ressortir les limites des approches existantes. et d’assoir un ensemble de nouvelles approches apportant des améliorations évaluées expérimentalement sur des données réelles. Le cœur des nouvelles approches proposées est l’exploitation des relations entre les labels.

Cham,Graded multi-label classification (GMLC) is a supervised machine learning task where the association between each data and a label has a membership degree from an ordinal scale of membership degrees: for example. an odorous molecule can be associated to the graded subset of odors {strong musc. moderate animal} based on the ordinal scale of odor intensity: {very weak. weak. moderate. strong. very strong}. and a movie can be associated to the graded subset of labels {action . suspense . humour } based on the ordinal scale of one-to-five star rating. The aim in GMLC is to build a predictive model called classifier. in order to predict the graded set of labels based on descriptive attributes of data. For example. predicting the graded set of molecule odors based on molecular properties such as the molecular structure and weight.

8168,Experimental and theoretical investigations on interfacial temperature jumps during evaporation,2007,VK Badam and V Kumar and F Durst and K Danov,32,Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science,1,276-292,Elsevier,Experimental results are summarized on investigations of positive temperature jumps at water–vapor interfaces during steady-state evaporation under low-pressure. Steady-state evaporation of water experiments were carried out to measure the interfacial properties and to obtain the evaporation rate. The interfacial vapor temperature close to the interface was always found to be higher than the interfacial liquid temperature. To study the influence of the vapor side thermal boundary conditions on the temperature jump. the evaporation chamber was heated with the help of a heating wire mesh which was mounted in the vapor side plane above the evaporating free surface. It was astounding to the authors to find that the temperature jump at the liquid–vapor interface increases linearly with the heat flux from the vapor side. The maximum temperature jump across the water–vapor interface was measured as 15.68 °C in …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:vtsb3mgoJX0C,125,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089417770700060X,8585756798289590784,/scholar?cites=8585756798289590784,,http://www.lcpe.uni-sofia.bg/publications/2007/pdf/2007-06-Durst-KD-Evaporation.pdf,0

Biodiesel is renewable. non toxic. biodegradable and usually contains no sulfur or aromatic compounds. The drawbacks of biodiesel are that it costs more than petroleum based diesel. softens and deteriorates certain elastomers and rubber compounds that are used in parts of fuel injection system such as fuel and pump seals. Another very important problem associated with the biodiesel is its storage as biodiesel is vulnerable to oxidation due to environmental factors such as air. moisture light etc. During oxidation. biodiesel breaks into unwanted smaller chain compounds such as aldehydes. small chain esters etc. beyond tolerable limits.

This microorganism exhibited very slow growth rates on acetate as carbon source. which led to design a two-stage cultivation process. The first consisted of cell growth on glucose as carbon source until its complete exhaustion. The second step involved the use of acetate as carbon source under nitrogen limitation in order to induce lipid accumulation. A typical experiment performed in a bioreactor involved a preliminary yeast growth with a glucose initial concentration of 15 g/L glucose.

Unlike conventional manufacturing (eg. CNC machining). where a part is fabricated by selectively removing material from a workpiece. in SFF. a part is built by depositing material. layer-by-layer. under computer control. Solid Freeform Fabrication is in principle a 2.5 D process-stacking up layers-with the advantage that the part’s geometric complexity has little impact on the fabrication process.An attractive and powerful feature of SFF. yet to be fully exploited. is the ability to deposit several materials in varying composition within a layer and also vary materials between layers. Also. by depositing different materials. in varying proportions. the part can be endowed with varying microstructure. Advances in mechanical and structural design have led to the development of mathematical techniques for the design of topology and material microstructure of such “heterogeneous” objects. For example. the homogenization design method (HDM) can be used to derive material microstructure and density distribution for a part corresponding to designer-prescribed properties; eg. parts with negative Poisson’s ratio can be designed [4]. Conventional manufacturing techniques cannot realize such novel and efficient designs.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:L10a_WkAb44C,46,http://www-cdr.stanford.edu/interface/publications/IFIP-PP.pdf,13343538309515422707,/scholar?cites=13343538309515422707,,http://www-cdr.stanford.edu/interface/publications/IFIP-PP.pdf,0

Process planning for LM includes determining the optimal build orientation. designing support structures. slicing. path planning. and selecting process parameters. Currently. 3D design data is almost invariably transferred to the LM process planning system using a commercially developed format known as STL. However. there is growing dissatisfaction in the LM community with STL and its underlying representation. Proposed alternative formats are described and their advantages and disadvantages discussed. Data output by LM process planning systems is normally stored in one of several slice formats. These are also described. We propose metrics for the evaluation of the 3D model and 2D slice formats and use them to make comparisons.

The EPR spectra exhibit weak resonance signal at g ≈ 4.50 and intense resonance signal at g ≈ 1.98. A sharp resonance signal at g ≈ 1.97 was also observed at lower concentrations of chromium. The concentration dependence of the linewidth of the resonance signal at g ≈ 1.98 suggests the formation of Cr3+ ion clusters by magnetic superexchange interactions. The temperature dependence of the peak to peak intensity and the linewidth of the resonance signal at g ≈ 1.98 suggests that the exchange interactions between Cr3+ ions in the present sample were antiferromagnetic in nature with Néel temperature.

An optimized parallel-vector block-structured finite volume Navier–Stokes equations solver is extended to include the effects of thermocapillary convection. Owing to the presence of surface tension gradients. the magnitude of the radial velocity towards the crystal becomes high at the free surface. Consequently. the temperature along the free surface is increased. The thermocapillary convection reduces the temperature fluctuations below the crystal and the free surface of the melt. However. below the crystal. the turbulent kinetic energy. k. is higher at different melt depths when the thermocapillary effect is taken into account.

An existing moving-grid method for incompressible fluids which satisfies a so-called space conservation law (SCL) was applied in order to account for the fluxes due to the movements of the grids. A consistent formulation of the SCL is presented. The grid mesh was dynamically controlled by a simple parametric sliding-mesh algorithm during the simulations. to avoid highly skewed cells within the domain. This algebraic smoothing algorithm was applied individually within each block of the numerical domain of the block-structured grid. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated by adopting two different problems of melting/solidification found in the literature.

The most common industrial use of LM today is for rapid prototyping. but we take a wider view of it as a flexible fabrication technology. Its use in building functional metallic parts under computer control has already been demonstrated in the research context. Commercial LM machines for building production parts are in prospect. We report on a study of current and proposed data formats for communication between the various stages of the LM process. They are compared. and attention is given to the issue of their extensibility to meet future needs. In this last respect. particular emphasis is given to materials-related and other nongeometric information needed for fabricating multi-material objects and objects with graded material properties.

8275,Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) may be a striking link between modern diet and health,2019,Vidhu Gill and Vijay Kumar and Kritanjali Singh and Ashok Kumar and Jong-Joo Kim,9,,12,888,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The Maillard reaction is a simple but ubiquitous reaction that occurs both in vivo and ex vivo during the cooking or processing of foods under high-temperature conditions. such as baking. frying. or grilling. Glycation of proteins is a post-translational modification that forms temporary adducts. which. on further crosslinking and rearrangement. form permanent residues known as advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Cooking at high temperature results in various food products having high levels of AGEs. This review underlines the basis of AGE formation and their corresponding deleterious effects on the body. Glycated Maillard products have a direct association with the pathophysiology of some metabolic diseases. such as diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). acute renal failure (ARF). Alzheimer’s disease. dental health. allergies. and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The most glycated and structurally abundant protein is collagen. which acts as a marker for diabetes and aging. where decreased levels indicate reduced skin elasticity. In diabetes. high levels of AGEs are associated with carotid thickening. ischemic heart disease. uremic cardiomyopathy. and kidney failure. AGEs also mimic hormones or regulate/modify their receptor mechanisms at the DNA level. In women. a high AGE diet directly correlates with high levels of androgens. anti-Müllerian hormone. insulin. and androstenedione. promoting ovarian dysfunction and/or infertility. Vitamin D3 is well-associated with the pathogenesis of PCOS and modulates steroidogenesis. It also exhibits a protective mechanism against the harmful effects of AGEs.

No person. no country or no region of the world is immune to climatic changes. Past global efforts at dealing with the problem of global warming (which is most evident form of climate change) concentrated on mitigation. with the aim of reducing and possibly stabilizing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere. As stabilisation of GHG’s primarily depend upon changes in technology. discovery of new and less polluting fuels and with awareness in human behaviour towards mother earth. And all these changes are slow in nature. that’s why adaptation is seen as viable option in reducing the vulnerability to anticipated negative impacts of global warming.Now. at the global level it is increasingly realised that mitigation and adaptation should be perused complement to each other. However. increasing integrating mitigation and adaptation strategies in terms of climate changes are not completely new idea in India and especially in north-western India. This region is characterised by severe and frequent droughts from centuries. And given the rich cultural values of north-western region. local population through their indigenous knowledge systems. have developed a unique from of skills to reduce their vulnerability to variability in local climate.

Since existing hypervisors were not designed to handle the scale and heterogeneity of many-core hardware. our design will differ from that of existing hypervisors in many important ways. The design of our experimental many-core hypervisor. Cypress. is based on three principles: partitioning. localization. and customization. Together. these principles facilitate scalability. by minimizing the sharing of scheduling runqueues. and manage heterogeneity. by assigning to each VM the cores most suitable for its workload. In this paper we motivate our design. present its key components. discuss challenges in our research. and report on its status.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:ceYDisMMNkQC,15,http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~sasha/papers/MMCS-2008.pdf,12415610792000607914,/scholar?cites=12415610792000607914,,http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~sasha/papers/MMCS-2008.pdf,0

8304,Improving reporting delay and lifetime of a WSN using controlled mobile sinks,2019,Vicky Kumar and Ashok Kumar,10,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,4,1433-1441,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are characterized by many to one traffic pattern. where a large number of nodes communicate their sensed data to the sink node. Due to heavy data traffic near the sink node. the nodes closer to sink node tends to exhaust their energy faster compared to those nodes which are situated away from the sink. This may lead to the fragment of a network due to the early demise of sensor nodes situated closer to the sink. To pacify this problem. mobile sinks are proposed for WSNs. Mobile sinks are capable to provide uniform energy consumption. load distribution. low reporting delay and quick data delivery paths. However. the position of the mobile sink needs to be updated regularly as such position update messages may reduce the network lifetime.

All nodes are capable of movement and can be connected dynamically in an arbitrary manner. Due to the dynamic nature of network topology. frequent mobility. bandwidth limitation. limited battery power. routing in MANETs is a challenging task. Routing protocols are vital for the proper functioning of Adhoc networks. A routing protocol in MANET should fairly distribute the routing tasks among mobile hosts. Most current routing protocols for mobile Adhoc networks consider the shortest path with minimum hop count as optimal route without any consideration of any particular node’s traffic and thus degrading the performance by causing serious problems in mobile node like congestion. power depletion and queuing delay. Therefore it is very attractive to investigate Routing protocols which use a Routing Metric to Balance Load in Adhoc networks.

Inclusion complex of Aceclofenac with β-Cyclodextrin was prepared by physical mixture. co-grinding and kneading method at 1: 1 w/w ratio. It was clear that kneading method would be the best method for the preparation of inclusion complex of Aceclofenac with β-CD. Hence Kneading method was selected for further study (K1. K2. K3 & K4 in 1: 0.5. 1: 1. 1: 1.5 & 1: 2 ratios respectively). Phase solubility study was conducted to evaluated the effect of polymer on aqueous solubility of Aceclofenac. Solid state characterization was evaluated by Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In vitro dissolution study was performed in phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. In vitro dissolution rate of Aceclofenac from solid dispersion (SD) was significantly higher compared to pure Aceclofenac.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:viP-qiFw8s0C,12,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Himansu_Samal/publication/286870640_Solubility_and_Dissolution_Improvement_of_Aceclofenac_using_-_Cyclodextrin/links/59157ae7a6fdcc963e8286a6/Solubility-and-Dissolution-Improvement-of-Aceclofenac-using-Cyclodextrin.pdf,15482771606633794297,/scholar?cites=15482771606633794297,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Himansu_Samal/publication/286870640_Solubility_and_Dissolution_Improvement_of_Aceclofenac_using_-_Cyclodextrin/links/59157ae7a6fdcc963e8286a6/Solubility-and-Dissolution-Improvement-of-Aceclofenac-using-Cyclodextrin.pdf,0

The hsp70s are a family of ubiquitously expressed heat shock proteins. In the recent years. hsp70 has been considered to be one of the candidate genes for predicting cytotoxicity against environmental chemicals. Nowadays emphasis is given to the use of alternatives to mammals in testing. research and education. The European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (EVCAM) has recommended the use of Drosophila as an alternative model for scientific studies. Almost all living organisms possess proteins with a similar structure to that of hsp70s. In the present study. the toxicity of MMS was evaluated by quantifying hsp70 expression and tissue damage in the third instar larvae of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) Bg9. at different doses and hours of exposure. We studied the effect of 0.25. 0.50. 0.75 and 1.0 μl/ml of MMS at 2. 4. 24 and 48 hours of exposure on hsp70 expression by using the soluble O-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) assay and on establishing the tissue damage by the Trypan blue exclusion assay in the third instar larvae of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) Bg9. A dose-dependent increase in the expression of hsp70 was observed at 0.25. 0.50. and 0.75 μl/ml of MMS compared to the control. At the highest dose. i.e. 1.0 μl/ml of MMS. the activity of hsp70 was decreased due to tissue damage.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:Sc6NBd4wEwEC,11,https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/intox/4/3/article-p159.xml,8154511922687641168,/scholar?cites=8154511922687641168,,https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/intox/4/3/article-p159.xml,0

Inc.,A study was conducted to evaluate thermal properties and degradation kinetic parameters of FD cow milk and camel milk powder. FT-IR was used to confirm the fat removal from the whole milk powder. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to study the thermal transitions. DSC thermograms of WMP showed a two-step endotherm. the former at lower temperatures (cow milk 16-35 C. camel milk 25-60 C) and the later at higher temperatures (cow milk 75-125 C. camel milk 90-160 C). The main difference observed between cow and camel milk was peak maximum temperature for fat melting. ΔH and other decomposition temperatures. The enthalpy of fat melting was 2.314 J/g and 3.397 J/g for cow and camel milk respectively. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)/derivative thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) also showed two steps degradation. The first step involves lactose degradation and second step corresponds to combined degradation of protein and fat.

8341,Solid model creation for materially graded objects,1997,Vinod Kumar and Debasish Dutta,,1997 International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium,,,,"Materially graded objects are objects composed of different constituent materials and could exhibit continuously varying composition and/or microstructure [1][2]. Such continuous changes results in gradation in their properties and distinguish them from objects made of conventional composites. They are also known as heterogeneous objects. functionally graded/gradient materials (FGM) and multi-material objects/structures [1]. In this paper. we use the terms ""materially graded objects"" and ""heterogeneous objects"" interchangeably. Recently. heterogeneous objects have found use in several engineering applications. The fabrication process that has shown potential to manufacture heterogeneous objects is called Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF). also known as Layered Manufacturing (LM) [3][4]. SFF is a material deposition process in which the material deposition can be controlled to vary the material composition throughout an object. thus fabricating a materially graded object. All SFF technologies are computer-based and require the CAD model ofthe object to be manufactured. However. current CAD systems are capable of representing only the geometry/topology information. Therefore. heterogeneous objects are fabricated using SFF by manually feeding the material information along with the geometry data. This is a cumbersome process and leads to the under-utilization ofthe SFF process. An assessment of existing representations for SFF is presented in [5] highlighting the need for CAD models which represent material information along with the geometry data of the object.",True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:XenU2NaEi7IC,11,https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/71440,15364299766039114865,/scholar?cites=15364299766039114865,,https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/71440/1997-71-Kumar.pdf?sequence=2,0

8346,Improved network lifetime and avoidance of uneven energy consumption using load factor,2019,Vicky Kumar and Ashok Kumar,10,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,4,1425-1432,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,In wireless sensor networks. communication load over a network is not uniform and hence the nodes closer to higher load area (near to sink node) exhaust their energy quickly than nodes situated other areas. i.e. hot spot or energy hole problem. This may lead to network partition into many unreachable segments and therefore affect the performance of the network. This problem is very critical for the random deployed networks. Therefore. we propose a load balancing method based upon the modifications in the sensing and communication ranges that overcomes the non-uniform load problem (energy hole) and also ensure full coverage and connectivity with least possible nodes. This approach controls the energy disparity by dividing the network into many segments (clusters) and then providing a suitable set of communication and sensing ranges for each segment based on its load.

8360,Quantitative size assessment of the lumbar spinal canal by computed tomography,2007,M Midia and Z Miabi,45,,5,377-382,ACTA MEDICA IRANICA,By determining normal ranges of spinal canal diameters we can make early diagnosis in persons who have lower diameters of spinal canal. These persons are predisposed to spinal canal stenosis that is a major cause of spinal radiculopathies. In different studies performed in several countries. minimum and maximum ranges of spinal canal diameters were different for each population. In this study. we tried to determine the mean values of normal spinal canal diameters and areas in Tabriz and its suburb. 39 healthy. young to mid-age cases were selected. Our study was focused on L3-L4 and L4-L5. The following parameters were measured: the area of cross-section of the vertebral body. the area of cross-section of the Dural sac. interarticular diameter. interligamentous diameter. antero-posterior diameter of the lumbar canal. inter-pedicular diameter. and the area of cross-section of the vertebral canal. A correlation between the parameters studied and the height of subjects was significant for interligamentous diameter (for L3/L4 and L4/L5) and interarticular diameter (only at L3/L4). cross-section area of the vertebrae (both L3 and L4). cross-section area of vertebral canal (only at L5 level). area of Dural sac (at L3/L4 and L4). It was suggested that these diameters and areas should be interpreted as a unction of height of the subject. Most of diameters studied had smaller means than those in previous studies.

This light sheet is made of two large diffused glass plates. A Ce:YAG phosphor layer was coated and sandwiched between the two diffusing sheets. The blue laser beam was first converted into a uniform laser line using a cylindrical lens. and a laser line was made incident parallel to the edges of the designed light sheet. The blue photons are waveguided inside the glass sheet via total internal reflection and scattered from the diffused surface. Some of the blue photons are absorbed by the Ce:YAG phosphor and down-converted into yellow light of longer wavelength. The white light emanating from the diffuse surface is the combined effect of yellow light with original blue light. The developed light sheet with the combination of laser line generation and total internal reflection is a unique and low …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:-woIMpg1IzIC,9,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-58-9-2402,17798024855154456819,/scholar?cites=17798024855154456819,,,0
8372,Aquaculture drugs: sources. active ingredients. pharmaceutic preparations and methods of administration,2017,V Kumar and S Roy,8,Journal of Aquaculture Research & Development,,510,,Aquaculture remains a growing. vibrant and important food production sector. However. disease outbreaks have disrupted aquaculture production. often with severe socio-economic and ecological consequences. Anti-microbial chemotherapy has been used in aquaculture for over past 60 years and discovery of new and effective anti-microbial agents have changed the microbial virulence and severity of disease. leading to a dramatic reduction in morbidity and mortality. and contributing to significant advances in the health of the general population. Anti-microbials are used both as prophylactic. at times of heightened risk of disease and as therapeutic. when an outbreak of disease occurs in the system. There are several anti-microbials drugs used for fish health management however. information on anti-microbial used in aquaculture and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of administration is very limited. In recent years. the issues relating to antibacterial use in animal food is under severe scientific and public scrutiny due to human health concern. Besides providing protection against microbial infection. chemotherapy may complicate health management by triggering toxicity. resistance. residues and occasionally public health and environmental consequences. Therefore. highly efficient and relatively safer drug is required to develop with the emphasis on prevention. which is likely to be more cost-effective than cure. which will reduce the possible problems associated with excessive use anti-microbials.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:TO92qYKFP5UC,9,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16435890017602110052&hl=en&oi=scholarr,16435890017602110052,/scholar?cites=16435890017602110052,,,0

Laser cladding emerged to be a promising method to achieve these objectives in a cost-effective way. The present paper studies the viability of cladding of tungsten disulfide (WS2) powder by using 400 W continuous-wave fiber laser. WS2 was used as a coating material. which was decomposed at higher temperature and underwent several chemical reactions. By this process. in situ formation of metal matrix composites and hard face coating on the substrate surface were attained. The characterization of laser cladded surface was done to study its morphological. microstructural. mechanical and tribological properties. It was observed that cladding of WS2 powder on 304 SS resulted in the formation of Cr-W-C-Fe metal matrix composite having improved …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:IuYOVjjUQBMC,9,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11665-016-2427-3.pdf,5594466589620139850,/scholar?cites=5594466589620139850,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammad_Raza9/publication/310542073_In_Situ_Production_of_Hard_Metal_Matrix_Composite_Coating_on_Engineered_Surfaces_Using_Laser_Cladding_Technique/links/5c25bcd292851c22a34a4879/In-Situ-Production-of-Hard-Metal-Matrix-Composite-Coating-on-Engineered-Surfaces-Using-Laser-Cladding-Technique.pdf,0

The risk to pedestrians is especially high in countries like India where a large number of pedestrians are seen on roads with vehicular traffic not yielding to their needs. Therefore. it is not surprising that many of the victims of road accidents in India. particularly in urban areas. are pedestrians. One of the primary reasons for accidents at pedestrian crossing (when drivers do not yield to pedestrians) lies in the inability of pedestrians to judge the safe gap while crossing a road. Often pedestrians are in a state of confusion/dilemma while making a decision on whether to accept or reject a gap. Under these circumstances. decision making for pedestrians during road crossing is a tough task.

In air medium. the fiber laser welding operations are performed at different laser powers (60. 80 and 100 W) and scanning speeds (40. 60 and 80 mm/min). Underwater welding operations have also been investigated at three different laser powers (330. 350 and 370 W) and two different scanning speeds (20 and 40 mm/min). The results show that welding of Ni sheet with higher laser power results in prominent heat-affected zone. increase in both microhardness and wt% of oxide formation in the weldment in both air and water medium. It is found that the increase in microhardness of weldment leads to the reduction in grain size. The heat-affected zone is reduced when scanning speed is increased.

Sea-level and surface meteorological measurements collected during storms exhibit strong synoptic disturbances leading to the coherent oscillations in the estuary with significant energy bands centred at periods of 24. 45. and 80 min. In particular. during the sporadic atmospheric event of June 2007. the atmospheric pressure dipped by ~12 mb. the wind direction stabilized to ~249° with peak wind speed up to 16 m s−1 and the positive sea-level surge swelled up by ~40 cm. Also. the water temperature cooled down by ~4.5 °C. Approximately 3 days prior to the 12 September 2007 Sumatra earthquake. the water temperature at Verem station started exhibiting a distinctly stronger semidiurnal oscillation (with a relatively larger variance of ~17.9 °C2 in contrast to a lesser variance of ~12 °C2 during the preceding normal days) and these well-defined oscillations continued to manifest for a week after the earthquake.

Different visualization methods (particle tracing. isosurface extraction and line integral convolution) are discussed and applied to time-dependent flow in the crucible. Co-visualization is used to investigate the dynamic evolution of the flow structures at high temporal resolution. Moreover. the co-visualization approach also allows for interactive online visualization and computational steering. which strongly increases the user's ability to visualize the results and to supervise and dynamically control the entire computational process.

The D2 analysis revealed that genotypes exhibited considerable diversity and were grouped into nine clusters. Twenty-seven genotypes representing different eco-geographical regions were grouped into cluster 1 indicating that genetic divergence and geographical divergence were not related. The characters. oil content. total number of seeds/head and total dry matter/plant. contributed maximum towards genetic divergence in D2 analysis.

In the course of their evolution. plants have evolved a variety of sophisticated and efficient mechanisms to sense. respond to. and adapt to changes in the surrounding environment. A common defensive mechanism activated by plants in response to abiotic stress is the production and accumulation of compatible solutes (also called osmolytes). This include amino acids (mainly proline). amines (such as glycinebetaine and polyamines). and sugars (such as trehalose and sugar alcohols). all of which are readily soluble in water and non-toxic at high concentrations. The metabolic pathways involved in the biosynthesis and catabolism of compatible solutes. and the mechanisms that regulate their cellular concentrations and compartmentalization are well characterized in many important plant species. Numerous studies have provided evidence that enhanced accumulation of compatible solutes in plants correlates with increased resistance to abiotic stresses. New insights into the mechanisms associated with osmolyte accumulation in transgenic plants and the responses of plants to exogenous application of osmolyte. will further enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which compatible solutes help to protect plants from damage due to abiotic stress and the potential roles compatible solutes could play in improving plants growth and development under optimal conditions for growth.

All searches use proton-proton collision data at A root s = 13 TeV. recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb(-1). In addition to the combination of previous searches. a targeted analysis requiring three or more charged leptons (electrons or muons) is presented. focusing on the challenging scenario in which the difference in mass between the two least massive neutralinos is approximately equal to the mass of the Z boson. The results are interpreted in simplified models of chargino-neutralino or neutralino pair production. For chargino-neutralino production. in the case when the lightest neutralino is massless. the combination yields an observed (expected) limit at the 95% confidence level on the chargino mass of up to 650 (570) GeV. improving upon the individual analysis limits by up to 40 GeV. If the mass difference between the two least massive neutralinos is approximately equal to the mass of the Z boson in the chargino-neutralino model. the targeted search requiring three or more leptons obtains observed and expected exclusion limits of around 225 GeV on the second neutralino mass and 125 GeV on the lightest neutralino mass. improving the observed limit by about 60 GeV in both masses compared to the previous CMS result.

Global oil palm area has quintupled from 1990 and it is grown in an area of 17 million ha with a palm oil production of 59.42 million tonnes. Oil yield is dependent not only on genotypes but also on environmental factors. The growth of common oil palm varieties is suppressed at temperatures below 15 C. Oil palm is a drought tolerant crop as it is surviving in locations with a dry season of several months. Nevertheless water deficit stress reduces the palm fresh fruit bunch yield to less than 5 tonnes/ha along with significant reduction (up to 26.30%) in vegetative growth. Excess soil moisture and continuous water logging are detrimental to oil palm fresh fruit bunch production. The important parameters. viz. the root biomass. potential root extraction ratio (PRER). rate of stomatal conductance and photosynthesis can be used for screening oil palm genotypes for drought tolerance. The progenies of Bamenda× Ekona and Tanzania× Ekona hybrids had drought tolerance and produced 40-42 tonnes of fresh fruit bunch during initial three years. The progenies of crosses between Deli× Yangambi (NIFOR. Nigeria). Bamenda× Ekona (ASD Costa Rica). Tanzania× Ekona and IRHO7010 were reported to adapt to prolonged drought conditions in Nigeria.

Investigations have been carried out using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer and biochemical parameters of Chlorophyll. Protein. Proline. Malondialdehyde (MDA). Nitrate and Nitrite content. Our observations indicate that Eichhornia crassipes have high accumulation efficiency of Fe over Trapa natans. Among the plant parts. roots showed the high metal accumulation potential as compared to shoot. However on high concentration. metal accumulation photosynthetic pigments and protein content is reduced. A promotive effect on amino acid (proline content) and enzyme activities (Malondialdehyde content) has been observed under metal accumulation stress possibly because of altered membrane properties and enhanced lipid per oxidation pathway.

Heidelberg,Optimal scheduling policies for multicore platforms have been the holy grail of systems programming for almost a decade now. In this paper. we take two instances of the optimal multicore scheduling problem. the dual-core and the quad-core instances. and attempt to solve them using Answer Set Programming. We represent the problem using a graph theoretic formulation. whereby finding the minimum edge cover of a weighted graph aids us in finding an optimal multicore schedule. We then use an answer set solver to obtain answer sets of varying sizes for our formulation. While a polynomial time algorithm for finding the minimum edge cover of a weighted graph exists in imperative languages and is suitable for dual-core processors. our approach uses ASP techniques to solve both the dual-core and quad-core versions of this problem.

8531,Secure directed diffusion routing protocol for sensor networks using the LEAP protocol,2006,VijayRaman Kumar and Johnson Thomas and Ajith Abraham,6,NATO SECURITY THROUGH SCIENCE SERIES D-INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SECURITY,,183,IOS PRESS,Sensor networks are finding multiple applications and are being increasingly deployed in the real world. These sensors are fragile with limited computational and storage resources and communicate with each other and a base station through routing protocols. Routing protocols in sensor networks seek to minimize energy consumption and do not take security into consideration. leaving the network vulnerable to malicious outside attacks. Due to the resource limitations of sensors. the standard security protocols cannot be applied. A number of key management protocols for sensors have been proposed. However. these key management protocols do not consider the routing problem. In this paper we modify an existing key management protocol called LEAP and integrate it into the directed diffusion sensor routing protocol to produce a secure routing protocol for sensor networks. We show that the proposed protocol can protect the network from malicious outside attacks. Simulation results also show that there is a slight overhead in terms of energy expenditure for the proposed protocol. The other overhead is a slightly increased packet size.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:xzrbwP069QAC,5,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZmB39UpxTLUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA183&dq=info:CIuRtH-FbCcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=J91X7j6E9P&sig=wMQ8zZry1qYBc-K3p7hWxh97BbA,2840792248500718344,/scholar?cites=2840792248500718344,,http://www.isda04.softcomputing.net/arwisa05.pdf,0

The fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans initially infects leaves of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in autumn in Europe and then grows systemically from leaf lesions along the leaf petiole to the stem. where it causes damaging phoma stem canker (blackleg) in summer before harvest. Due to the difficulties of investigating resistance to L. maculans growth in leaves and petioles under field conditions. identification of quantitative resistance typically relies on end of season stem canker assessment on adult plants. To investigate whether quantitative resistance can be detected in young plants. we first selected nine representative DH (doubled haploid) lines from an oilseed rape DY (‘Darmor-bzh’ × ‘Yudal’) mapping population segregating for quantitative resistance against L. maculans for controlled environment experiment (CE). We observed a significant correlation between distance grown by L. maculans along the leaf petiole towards the stem (r = 0.91) in CE experiments and the severity of phoma stem canker in field experiments. To further investigate quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to resistance against growth of L. maculans in leaves of young plants in CE experiments. we selected 190 DH lines and compared the QTL detected in CE experiments with QTL related to stem canker severity in stems of adult plants in field experiments.

High weight of tractors and farm machineries increases the concern about the soil compaction. This review act as a guide for farm persons on the negative impact of soil compaction on crops causes and soil management practices and methods for alleviation of compaction with decreasing the risk of more extensive compaction damage in the future. Compaction changes many soil properties and negative effects are related to a decrease in permeability to air and water in root zone of crops. This results into decreased crop production and increased draft of tillage operations. The major causes of the soil compaction are use of heavy machinery traffic. performing same farm operations on the field. poor crop diversification and time restrictions in the crop cycle. To correct soil compaction problem. first tactile method is to avoid or limit farm operations that causes the compaction.

Boron (B) or Carbon (C) have been of interest to the aluminum foundry industries for grain refinement of Al alloy systems. However. the use of titanium carbide (TiC) inoculants to refine Al–Cu–Si systems has not yet been successful. Thus. this work examined the possibility of grain refining of B319 aluminum alloy by the direct addition of TiC powder into liquid melt. TiC addition levels of 0.01. 0.02. 0.03. 0.05 and 0.1 wt% were examined. The results suggested that the addition of TiC powder to the alloy refined the microstructure and promoted segregation of eutectic phases. Thermal analysis confirmed a decrease in the nucleation temperature of primary α-Al during solidification as TiC concentration increased. Secondary Dendrite Arm Spacing decreased with increasing addition of TiC. resulting in a concomitant increase in the hardness and the yield strength of the as …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:-z4IEurqN94C,4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12666-015-0672-z,14608884558012844406,/scholar?cites=14608884558012844406,,,0

Motor current signature analysis is used to investigate the use of an induction motor as a transducer to indicate the faults in multistage gearbox via analyzing supply parameters such as phase current and instantaneous power. In gearboxes. load fluctuations on the gearbox and gear defects are two major sources of vibration. Further at times. measurement of vibration in the gearbox is not easy because of the inaccessibility in mounting the vibration transducers. This analysis system can be used for measuring the characteristics for a perfectly working gearbox and use the data as a standard for measuring faults and defects in other gearboxes. The objective of this paper is to design and diagnose fault in the gearbox using motor current analysis system at different gear operations on different loads. Steady load conditions on the gearbox are tested for current signatures during different gear operations. Also found the minimum power required to run on different gears and gear ratio. The motor current analysis system can be used further to specify mainly faults in the gear. misalignment of meshed gears. loss of contact of the gears and bearing wear.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:-YxgYmOPpg0C,4,https://www.academia.edu/download/37638929/H03024553.pdf,9961435050118656911,/scholar?cites=9961435050118656911,,https://www.academia.edu/download/37638929/H03024553.pdf,0

8574,Effect of Load on the Performance of DI Diesel Engine Running on Rice Bran Bio-diesel and Its Blends,2014,Mir Mohsin John and Vineet Kumar,1,Journal of Basic and Applied Engineering Research,,2350-0077,,The two alarming situations in front of the engineers worldwide are to reduce the load on the conventional fuels and to reduce the ever increasing environmental pollution. This study is aimed to investigate experimentally the performance of DI diesel engine at varying loads when fuelled with blends of rice bran oil and diesel. The experiments were conducted on widely used diesel engine without major modifications. All the tests were steady state and conducted at constant speed. The effect of varying load was evaluated in terms of brake thermal efficiency. mass flow rate. brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature. Experimental results shows that at full load conditions. the B-100. B-75. B-50 and B-25 blends produce 33.23%. 32.81%. 32.39% and 31.97% higher brake thermal efficiency than sole diesel respectively. It was found that brake thermal efficiency of rice bran biodiesel is higher than that of diesel. and it is because of the oxygenated molecule of biodiesel which results in complete combustion of the biodiesel fuel. Also the mass flow rate of biodiesel seems to be higher than that of diesel fuel; it is because the calorific value of biodiesel is higher than that of diesel fuel. On the basis of results obtained from this study the use of rice bran oil as a fuel is recommended for the use in diesel engine with diesel blends.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:nOZr35tmOW8C,4,https://www.krishisanskriti.org/jbaerjournal/Paper%204.pdf,10204237590155006337,/scholar?cites=10204237590155006337,,https://www.krishisanskriti.org/jbaerjournal/Paper%204.pdf,0

Machines and Mechanisms, IIT Roorkee, India",,18-20,,The present paper deals with the static and dynamic characteristics including the stability of flexibly supported narrow hydrodynamic journal bearings lubricated under the micropolar lubricants. From the basic equations ie the equation of continuity of mass. the equations for the balance of linear momentum and the balance of angular momentum. which are coupled together due to the existence of two kinematic vector fields of the microstructures and characterizing the micropolar fluid. the derivation of Reynolds equation has been modified. The theoretical prediction of hydrodynamic pressures in the bearing is obtained by the solution of modified Reynolds equation satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions. The steady state pressure profile is obtained easily by an analytical method. The steady state parameters like load carrying capacity and attitude angle can be easily obtained once the pressure profile over the entire bearing surface has been found. First order perturbations of eccentricity ratio and attitude angle are used to calculate the dynamic pressure and the resulting equations are solved by analytical method. Dynamic characteristics are obtained in terms of stiffness and damping coefficients by the help of perturbed pressures.

8579,In silico engineering of aggregation-prone recombinant proteins for substrate recognition by the chaperonin GroEL,2012,Vipul Kumar and Ankita Punetha and Durai Sundar and Tapan K Chaudhuri,13,,7,1-9,BioMed Central,Molecular chaperones appear to have been evolved to facilitate protein folding in the cell through entrapment of folding intermediates on the interior of a large cavity formed between GroEL and its co-chaperonin GroES. They bind newly synthesized or non-native polypeptides through hydrophobic interactions and prevent their aggregation. Some proteins do not interact with GroEL. hence even though they are aggregation prone. cannot be assisted by GroEL for their folding. In this study. we have attempted to engineer these non-substrate proteins to convert them as the substrate for GroEL. without compromising on their function. We have used a computational biology approach to generate mutants of the selected proteins by selectively mutating residues in the hydrophobic patch. similar to GroES mobile loop region that are responsible for interaction with GroEL. and compared with the wild counterparts for calculation of their instability and aggregation propensities. The energies of the newly designed mutants were computed through molecular dynamics simulations. We observed increased aggregation propensity of some of the mutants formed after replacing charged amino acid residues with hydrophobic ones in the well defined hydrophobic patch. raising the possibility of their binding ability to GroEL. The newly generated mutants may provide potential substrates for Chaperonin GroEL. which can be experimentally generated and tested for their tendency of aggregation. interactions with GroEL and the possibility of chaperone-assisted folding to produce functional proteins.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:NmoEDshWDT0C,4,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-S7-S22,4812038327610425505,/scholar?cites=4812038327610425505,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-S7-S22,0

It is an uncommon problem that occurs predominantly inelderly. debilitated women. Incidence rates vary widely throughout the world but range from 0.073–1.0% of all hernias and 0.2–1.6% of all cases of mechanical obstruction [2]. The hernia proceeds through the obturator foramen situated bilaterally in the anterolateral pelvic wall. inferior to the acetabulum [3]. The obturator nerves and vessels pass through this tunnel. protected by extraperitoneal connective tissue and fat. Emaciation and advanced age cause the loss of this tissue as evidenced by most patients being in their seventh and eighth decades [2].

One such mechanical cues that is known to influences cell migration is the gradient of substrate elastic modulus (E).

In this study. we investigated the influence of the gradient of viscous nature. as defined by loss modulus. G"". on cell migration.

We have confirmed uniform collagen density and constant storage modulus of the gel by fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy to eliminate the possibilities of haptotaxis and durotaxis. We hypothesize that material creep in the high loss modulus region hinders the building up of the cellular traction. leading to a force asymmetry that drives the observed viscotaxis. To verify our hypothesis. we estimated the cellular traction on gels with high and low loss moduli. We indeed found that cells apply higher traction force on more elastic materials i.e. materials with low loss modulus.

Austenitic stainless have Nickel and Chromium as basic constituents. It has excellent corrosion resistance properties and very good weldability. Austenitic stainless steels have a tendency to form chromium depleted zones at the grain boundaries during welding and heat treatment. where chromium combines with available carbon in the vicinity of the grain boundaries. to produce an area depleted in chromium. and thus becomes susceptible to intergranular corrosion. Austenitic stainless steel during welding GTAW have been investigated and concluded that variation in normalize temperature. time and heat input due to welding and heat treatment resulted in significant changes in the mechanical properties of the austenitic stainless steels and due to the effect of sensitization mechanical properties (yield strength. ultimate tensile strength. hardness.

The oral cavity can sometimes be a site for extra-pulmonary tuberculosis with a highly variable clinical presentation including ulceration. diffuse infl ammatory lesions. granulomas and fi ssures. Oral lesions usually appear secondary to a primary tubercular infection elsewhere. although primary infection of the oral mucosa by Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been described. We report here a rare case of primary tuberculosis of the hard palate extending to gingiva. manifesting as gingival enlargement with ulceration. Diagnosis was established by histopathological examination of tissue biopsy and by chest radiography. The patient was put on anti-tubercular therapy for nine months to which a prompt response was obtained.

The company produces the product mainly to meet and satisfy the needs of the customers. Advertising plays an important role on changing the consumer behavior and also provides new patterns for purchasing or using any type of goods and services. It is the most convenient way to reach the female consumers because they are more deployed by advertisement promises that the product will give them something special for satisfaction. The advertiser. the agency. the media and the consumers view advertising according to their desires. expectation and opportunities. Over the recent years. advertisements remain the favored method of sales promotion. Consequently. the challenge for an advertiser is to explore every possible avenue of making an advertisement more noticeable. attractive and impellent for consumers. This study brings the insights on the impact of ads in the purchase behavior of the two-wheelers among the women customers. and the output shall pave the way for rejuvenating the marketing and advertising strategy to tap the market on the wider range.

Histogram Equalization (HE) is widely used for contrast enhancement in digital images. However. this technique is not very well suited to be implemented in consumer electronics. such as television. because the method tends to introduce unnecessary visual deterioration and false contouring due to the significant change in brightness. CESRHE uses linear interpolation method to smooth the histogram in order to moderate the histogram variation effectively. CESRHE separates the intensity range of histogram into k parts and maps the grayscale range based on its Sub-Intensity Range of Output Histogram (SIROH). Then equalizes each sub-region respectively. After that. Intensities of histogram are uniformly redistributed in whole grayscale range. At last. we get the result after the processed sub-regions are composed into one image. The simulation result shows that the algorithm can not only enhance image information effectively but also keep the original image luminance well enough to make it possible to be used in video system directly.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:k1VWYO0b_yEC,3,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.219.6443&rep=rep1&type=pdf,13642009981293071415,/scholar?cites=13642009981293071415,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.219.6443&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

The key feature of our proposed algorithm is its ability to use multiple templates for each of the words which form the ""password"" text. The use of multiple templates allows the proposed system to capture the idiosyncratic intra-speaker variability of a word. resulting in significant improvement in the performance. Our algorithm also uses inter-word silence templates to handle continuous speech input. Application of the proposed algorithm to two 100-speaker speaker-recognition systems. namely. closed-set speaker-identification (CSI) and speaker-verification (SV). delivers 100% speaker identification accuracy and a speaker-verification EER of 0.09%.

8697,Neurodynamic explanation of inter-individual and inter-trial variability in cross-modal perception,2018,G Vinodh Kumar and Shrey Dutta and Siddharth Talwar and Dipanjan Roy and Arpan Banerjee,,bioRxiv,,286609,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,A widely used experimental design in multisensory integration is the McGurk paradigm that entail illusory (cross-modal) perception of speech sounds when presented with incongruent audio-visual (AV) stimuli. However. the distribution of responses across trials and individuals is heterogeneous and not necessarily everyone in a given group of individuals perceives the effect. Nonetheless. existing studies in the field primarily focus on addressing the correlation between subjective behavior and cortical activations to reveal the neuronal mechanisms underlying the perception of McGurk effect. typically in the “frequent perceivers”. Additionally. a solely neuroimaging approach does not provide mechanistic explanation for the observed inter-trial or inter-individual heterogeneity. In the current study we employ high density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in a group of 25 human subjects that allow us to distinguish “frequent perceivers” from “rare perceivers” using behavioral responses as well as from the perspective of large-scale brain functional connectivity (FC). Using global coherence as a measure of large-scale FC. we find that alpha band coherence. a distinctive feature in frequent perceivers is absent in the rare perceivers. Secondly. a decrease in alpha band coherence and increase in gamma band coherence occur during illusory perception trials in both frequent and rare perceivers. Source analysis followed up with source time series reconstructions reveals a large scale network of brain areas involving frontal. temporal and parietal areas that are involved in network level processing of cross-modal perception.

In some cases the pitch value of female is lower and also pitch of some male is high. in that case the exact required result is not being produced by this classification method. By considering the aforesaid problem we have here suggested a new method for gender classification which considers three features.

The fuel used in this power plant was low calorific value sub bituminous coal. The irreversibility rates (or exergy destruction rates) of each cylinder of turbine are obtained for different ambient temperatures by the exergy analysis. The ambient temperature was selected within the range of 5–450C. The percentage efficiency defects of each turbine (or the ratios of the irreversibility rates to the fuel exergy rate) and the exergy efficiencies were determined for different ambient temperatures. Exergy parameters steam turbine cylinders have been determined to compare the actually achieved performance parameters with ideal performance parameters. which are not achievable indeed but these are authentically comparable. Increased destruction of exergy of any component shows that it has better scope of improvement.

It is very common in northern and southern India. causing considerable losses to fish farmers. Ulcerative disease syndrome has been used to describe a group of cutaneous diseases of finfish (Hargis 1985). Among different ulcerative diseases. an EUS-like condition was first reported in the summer of 1971 in farmed ayu Plecoglossus altivelis in Oita Prefecture. Japan (Egusa and Masuda 1971). A similar disease was also reported in March 1972 from central Queensland. Australia. where several species of estuarine fish developed large shallow circular or irregular skin lesions termed 'red-spot disease' (Rodgers and Burke 1981). India witnessed the first major outbreak of EUS in 1988 in the states of Tripura. Assam. Meghalaya and West Bengal. It gradually spread. until 1992. to the states of Orissa. Bihar. Uttar Pradesh.

The medium was replaced for every two days and the spent medium was used to assess the concentration of estradiol 17-β in cultured granulosa cells by radioimmunoassay. The BMP-2 at all the three different doses increased the estradioal 17-β production when compared to control group of treatment (P<0.05). It was observed that even the lower doses tested (30 ng/ml) caused a significant increase in estradiol 17-β production by the granulosa cells as compared to the control (P<0.001). but no significant difference was observed among the different doses tested. It is concluded that all three different doses of BMP-2 were capable to increase the estradioal 17-β production without effecting the proliferation of granulosa cellsin sheep,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:CBgv6AxxBp0C,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12216377149814194066&hl=en&oi=scholarr,12216377149814194066,/scholar?cites=12216377149814194066,,,0

8752,Moment curvature relationships for fire damaged reinforced concrete sections,2010,DMSP Prasad and V Kumar and UK Sharma and P Bhargava,,Structures in Fire: Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference,,247,DEStech Publications. Inc,Once fire breaks out in a structure. it results in the loss of strength of the structure and as it may not be possible to use the structure safely. repair and rehabilitation options are to be chosen. To check for the feasibility options. it is often necessary to study the behavior of the structural elements after fire exposure. The relationship between moment and curvature demonstrates the strength and deformation characteristics of a given reinforced concrete section. If a complete momentcurvature relationship of fire damaged reinforced concrete section is available. one can determine the residual strength and ductility of the structural element. To this end. this paper reports the results of an experimental study carried out to determine the moment curvature relationships for fire damaged reinforced concrete beams. A total of 12 reinforced concrete beams of 100 mm x 200 mm x 2000 mm size were cast and tested under this test program. Test parameters were grade of concrete. lateral spacing of ties and duration of fire exposure. The doubly reinforced concrete beams were first exposed to standard fire in a full scale fire furnace. Subsequently after cooling. their moment curvature responses were recorded under two point loading. Based on the results. it has been found that the grade of concrete. transverse reinforcement spacing and duration of fire have considerable amount of influence on the moment carrying capacity and curvatures of the sections. The yield and the ultimate moment capacities of all the fire damaged beams decreased with an increase in fire duration.

Banana fruit stalk after harvest was used as substrate for the production of cellulase enzyme through solid state fermentation using Cellulomonas uda NCIM 2353. Response surface methodology (RSM) involving Box-Behnken design was applied for the optimization of medium constituents for cellulase production. A polynomial model was created to correlate the relation between the three important variables (moisture content. concentrations of glucose and beef extract) and the cellulase produced.

Heidelberg,The Czochralski (Cz) method is the preferred process for growing large silicon single crystals for wafers which are used in electronic and photonic devices. The liquid silicon (Pr= 0. 013) is contained in an open crucible which is rotating. while the counterrotating crystal is pulled from the melt. Due to this setup. centrifugal and Coriolis forces. buoyancy. and Marangoni convection occur in the fluid as well as thermal radiation from the surface and the phase change due to crystallization. The shape of the interface between melt and crystal is crucial for the quality of the resulting crystal. Therefore. the influences of all effects on the crystallization front need to be investigated. Unfortunately. the flow inside the melt is fully turbulent (Re≈ 104. Ra≈ 107). which makes numerical predictions difficult.

However. wall temperature data of supersonic impinging jets are not enough to data. The present study describes an experimental work to measure the wall temperatures of a vertical flat plate on which supersonic. dual. coaxial jet impinges. An Infrared camera is employed to measure the wall temperature distribution on the impinging plate. The pressure ratio of the jet is varied to obtain the supersonic jets in the range of over-expanded to moderately under-expanded conditions at the exit of coaxial nozzle. The distance between the coaxial nozzle and the flat plate was also varied. The coaxial jet flows are visualized using a Shadow optical method.

Natural images are characterized by absence of global minima for mean squared error. an energy minimization formulation based on the the principles of the calculus of variations. that helps in effective segmentation based on boundary information. The approach adopted is to treat this segmentation as a minimum partition approximation problem. using additional regularization terms. The constraints for stopping the evolving curve are derived by coupling information from each of the vectors of the vector described image. The coupling effect from each vector increases the segmentation accuracy. The results are qualitatively compared with an existing Chan et al.

By this technology integrates distributed generations. energy storage elements and loads. In this paper. dynamic performance enhancement of a grid consisting of wind turbine was investigated using permanent magnet synchronous generation (PMSG) and photovoltaic (PV). In order to maximize the output of solar array and wind. maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique was used by an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). These proposed methodology based reference model is trained to generate maximum power corresponding to varying the values of solar and wind. Simulation results reveal that the response of proposed ANFIS based MPPT method is more accurate and fast as compared to the conventional techniques like Incremental Conductance (IC). The analytical and simulation results of this research are presented to validate the concept. The proposed method also precedes the performance of the error reduction by the function of droop control method which exist the equal power sharing.

In the course of their evolution. plants have evolved a variety of sophisticated and efficient mechanisms to sense. respond to. and adapt to changes in the surrounding environment. A common defensive mechanism activated by plants in response to abiotic stress is the production and accumulation of compatible solutes (also called osmolytes). These include amino acids (mainly proline). amines (such as glycinebetaine and polyamines). and sugars (such as trehalose and sugar alcohols). all of which are readily soluble in water and nontoxic at high concentrations.

8826,Determination of Optimum Parameters of Porous Concrete for Adequate Strength and Permeability,2018,Mayank Gupta and Lupesh Dudi and Rahul Karkhanis and Veerendra Kumar,,,,129-136,American Society of Civil Engineers,The three defining parameters for porous concrete are its strength. porosity. and permeability. These properties are mutually related to each other and they depend on the water-cement ratio and the aggregate proportion and sizing. A good quality porous concrete should have high strength. along with sufficient permeability and porosity. However. with an increase in permeability and porosity of the concrete. the strength is significantly reduced. The objective of this study is to determine the optimum water-cement ratio and aggregate proportion. which would yield the desired values of parameters. Mix design for the porous concrete is derived from the guidelines based on the Indian standard for the conventional concrete. by eliminating the fine aggregates and targeting a porosity of 20%.

8830,A COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY OF SUPER RESOLVED AIRBORNE HYPERSPECTRAL OUTPUTS IN URBAN MATERIAL AND LAND COVER INFORMATION EXTRACTION.,2018,K Mishra and A Siddiqui and V Kumar,,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing & Spatial Information Sciences",,,,Urban areas despite being heterogeneous in nature are characterized as mixed pixels in medium to coarse resolution imagery which renders their mapping as highly inaccurate. A detailed classification of urban areas therefore needs both high spatial and spectral resolution marking the essentiality of different satellite data. Hyperspectral sensors with more than 200 contiguous bands over a narrow bandwidth of 1-10 nm can distinguish identical land use classes. However. such sensors possess low spatial resolution. As the exchange of rich spectral and spatial information is difficult at hardware level resolution enhancement techniques like super resolution (SR) hold the key. SR preserves the spectral characteristics and enables feature visualization at a higher spatial scale. Two SR algorithms: Anchored Neighbourhood Regression (ANR) and Sparse Regression and Natural Prior (SRP) have been executed on an airborne hyperspectral scene of Advanced Visible/Near Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) for the mixed environment centred on Kankaria Lake in the city of Ahmedabad thereby bringing down the spatial resolution from 8.1 m to 4.05 m. The generated super resolved outputs have been then used to map ten urban material and land cover classes identified in the study area using supervised Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification methods.

8832,Modelling and Performance Analysis of UPQC with Digital Kalman Control Algorithm under Unbalanced Distorted Source Voltage conditions,2018,Venkatesh Kumar and Rajeswari Ramachandran,18,Journal of Power Electronics,6,1830-1843,,In this paper. the generation of a reference current and voltage signal based on a Kalman filter is offered for a 3-phase 4wire UPQC (Unified Power Quality Conditioner). The performance of the UPQC is improved with source voltages that are distorted due to harmonic components. Despite harmonic and frequency variations. the Kalman filter is capable enough to determine the amplitude and the phase angle of load currents and source voltages. The calculation of the first state is sufficient to identify the fundamental components of the current. voltage and angle. Therefore. the Kalman state estimator is fast and simple. A Kalman based control strategy is proposed and implemented for a UPQC in a distribution system. The performance of the proposed control strategy is assessed for all possible source conditions with varying nonlinear and linear loads. The functioning of the proposed control algorithm with a UPQC is scrutinized and validated through simulations employing MATLAB/Simulink software. Using a FPGA SPATRAN 3A DSP board. the proposed algorithm is developed and implemented. A small-scale laboratory prototype is built to verify the simulation results. The stated control scheme for the UPQC reduces the following issues. voltage sags. voltage swells. harmonic distortions (voltage and current). unbalanced supply voltage and unbalanced power factor under dynamic and steady-state operating conditions.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:qoKP6G9emhYC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Venkatesh_Kumar10/publication/329610123_Modelling_and_Performance_Analysis_of_UPQC_with_Digital_Kalman_Control_Algorithm_under_Unbalanced_Distorted_Source_Voltage_conditions/links/5c12051ba6fdcc494ff03e55/Modelling-and-Performance-Analysis-of-UPQC-with-Digital-Kalman-Control-Algorithm-under-Unbalanced-Distorted-Source-Voltage-conditions.pdf,14435148149906462156,/scholar?cites=14435148149906462156,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Venkatesh_Kumar10/publication/329610123_Modelling_and_Performance_Analysis_of_UPQC_with_Digital_Kalman_Control_Algorithm_under_Unbalanced_Distorted_Source_Voltage_conditions/links/5c12051ba6fdcc494ff03e55/Modelling-and-Performance-Analysis-of-UPQC-with-Digital-Kalman-Control-Algorithm-under-Unbalanced-Distorted-Source-Voltage-conditions.pdf,0

8834,An automatic method for complete brain matter segmentation from multislice CT scan,2018,Soumi Ray and Vinod Kumar and Chirag Ahuja and Niranjan Khandelwal,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.06215,,,,Computed tomography imaging is well accepted for its imaging speed. image contrast & resolution and cost. Thus it has wide use in detection and diagnosis of brain diseases. But unfortunately reported works on CT segmentation is not very significant. In this paper. a robust automatic segmentation system is presented which is capable of segment complete brain matter from CT slices. without any lose in information. The proposed method is simple. fast. accurate and completely automatic. It can handle multislice CT scan in single run. From a given multislice CT dataset. one slice is selected automatically to form masks for segmentation. Two types of masks are created to handle nasal slices in a better way. Masks are created from selected reference slice using automatic seed point selection and region growing technique. One mask is designed for brain matter and another includes the skull of the reference slice. This second mask is used as global reference mask for all slices whereas the brain matter mask is implemented on only adjacent slices and continuously modified for better segmentation. Slices in given dataset are divided into two batches. before reference slice and after reference slice. Each batch segmented separately. Successive propagation of brain matter mask has demonstrated very high potential in reported segmentation. Presented result shows highest sensitivity and more than 96% accuracy in all cases. Resulted segmented images can be used for any brain disease diagnosis or further image analysis.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:_J9oLLwM63sC,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06215,12204015166203358967,/scholar?cites=12204015166203358967,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06215,0

8860,Macropore flow as a groundwater component in hydrologic simulation: modelling. applications and results,2017,M Ranjit Kumar and T Meenambal and V Kumar,112,CURRENT SCIENCE,6,1197,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,Macropore flow carries water from the soil surface to deeper profile or groundwater. bypassing the intermediate soil profile. The phenomenon is ubiquitous and not rare. A theoretical framework of this flow has not been perfected so far. but ignoring this process may lead to incomplete conceptualization of soil-water flow. The macropore flow has been modelled based on observed data on morphometry. macropore size distribution and fractal dimensions of soil voids and stain patterns. and incorporated in the Watershed Processes Simulation (WAPROS) model. The performance of WAPROS model was evaluated to be good (NSE–hourly; daily= 0.8578; 0.9020). when applied to a real watershed. The sensitivity of macropore flow submodel showed that the adjustment factor was linearly related to macropore flow. Simulations were performed for five types of soil. namely sandy loam. sandy clay loam. sandy clay. clay loam and silty clay loam (A. B. C. D and E respectively). The values of macroporosity factors and fractal dimensions generated for the five types of soil have been presented. The model generated data for A. B. C. D and E soil types were: the number of macropores: 379. 3074. 3412. 153 and 0; the macropore flow (mm): 1.5121. 9.3667. 15.1728. 4.4055 and 0; the average pore flow (mm/pore): 0.0040. 0.0030. 0.0044. 0.0287 and 0; and the macropore flow to base flow ratio: 0.0055. 0.0474. 0.1908. 0.2759 and 0.

BIOLOGICAL & CHEMICAL SCIENCES,Driver drowsiness is one of the major causes of traffic accidents happening now a days. It is one of the serious highway safety problem. some of the accidents can be prevented if the drivers are warned previously by drowsiness detecting systems. In order to reliably detect the drowsiness. it depends on the time sense warnings of drowsiness. To date. the effectiveness of drowsiness detection methods has been limited by their failure to consider individual differences. Based on the type of data used. drowsiness detection can be conveniently separated into the two categories of intrusive and non intrusive methods. During the survey. non-intrusive methods detect drowsiness by measuring driving behavior and sometimes eye features. through which camera based detection system is the best method and so are useful for real world driving situations.

Sundarbans ecosystem supports rich fisheries diversity and also natural biodiversity hot spot. because it is natural habitat of many endangered species. The Sundarbans is a home to a variety of faunal species. the total of 1586 species has been recorded which includes 481 Vertebrate species (30%). 1104 Invertebrate species (70%). Mangroves are the nursery and breeding grounds for several commercially important species of aquatic fauna like fish. shrimps and prawns etc. Mangrove ecosystems are of great ecological significance in the tropical and sub-tropical coast. Sundarbans mangrove provides a variety of ecosystem services. However. the Sundarban mangrove forest is the most threatened habitats in the world. increased population with few alternative livelihood opportunities poses a serious threat as it is the main cause of mangrove destruction. The total value of Sundarbans is not recognized and therefore often neglected in development planning. As a result Sundarbans conservation issue is getting less importance at the national level. The study reveals that major ecosystem services of Sundarbans are timber. fuel wood. fish. ecotourism. cyclone and storm protection. biodiversity. and habitat for flora and fauna. Timber. fuel wood and fish are more economical provisioning services in Sundarbans. It is noticed that there is decreasing tendency of overall revenue collection from the mangrove over the period of 2001-02 to 2009-10.

The main drawback of wireless sensor networks since most sensors are connected by non-rechargeable batteries. The lifetime of a sensor network can be increased by jointly applying different techniques of routing and scheduling schemes also brings great challenges to the design of efficient distributed routing protocols for multi-hop wireless sensor networks. In scheduling algorithms. the nodes are organized in sleep state when they are not required. The scheduling algorithms is applied to diminish resource starvation and to make honesty amongst the parties using the resources. The main impetus of routing algorithm is applied to wireless sensor networks for minimizing energy consumption due to retransmissions and dynamically bypass of different sensor nodes with less energy.

The clinical presentation in such cases is epigastric pain and progressively increasing jaundice. In any stage of disease. biliary obstruction has to be relieved with external drainage. Percutanoeus trans hepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) is the procedure of choice and is done by interventional radiologist under local anaesthesia [1]. As any interventional procedure under image guidance needs patient immobility and cooperation especially if done under LA. Catastrophic complications related to PTBD were reported in literature including bleeding. sepsis. acute pancreatitis. intrahepatic haematoma. and gut perforation [2]. Also. pain is the most common complaint in the post procedure period. As there is no standard anaesthetic technique described in literature for PTBD. we would like to share our experience using subcostal trans versus abdominis plane (TAP) block for PTBD.A 42 year cachexic male. diagnosed with carcinoma head of pancreas was planned for PTBD.

Australian Teak wood variety. also called as a Mahaneem or Forest neem. which has a great demand in Wood industry. The harvesting period is 6-7 years unlike the commercial Burma teak wook variety Tectonagrandis which takes almost a generation (60-70 years). Moreover. the Australian teak wood is cheaper when compared to Burma Teak wood. Conventional growth of Meliadubia through seeds is not much successful where the germination rate is very poor of about 14-34% only. So. Invitro propagation of the Meliadubia is very essential for large scale propagation of the species which also possess therapeutic properties. Also. Meliadubia can generate substantial power. the yellow mature stem. with more fibre and lignin content yielded around 200 dry metric tonnes per hectare.

The customer lifetime value (CLV) may be defined as the net present value of future profits from a customer. The important keywords embedded in the definition are ‘future’and ‘profits’. Computing future profits of a customer makes the customer equity metric inherently forward looking. thereby enabling marketers to invest the right amount of marketing resources in a customer today to get the expected value from the customer in the future. In contrast. traditional backward-looking metrics such as past customer value and past customer profits provide limited (if any) guidance to managers in terms of the expected revenue stream from a customer in the foreseeable future.Today. customer equity has established itself as one of the most dominant metrics for managers to measure and manage firm performance.

8899,Detection of Current consumption using Motor Current Signature Analysis,2015,P Venkata Vara Prasad and V Ranjith Kumar and V Naresh Babu and S Naga Kishore,,,,,,In order to achieve reliable and cost effective diagnosis. Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is used to investigate the use of an induction motor as a transducer to indicate the faults in multistage gearbox via analyzing supply parameters such as phase current and instantaneous power. Gears are important elements in a variety of industrial applications such as machine tools and gearboxes. An unexpected failure in gear may cause significant economic losses. The vibration signal analysis can be carried out the signature of the fault in the gears and used to determine early fault detection of the gearbox by using different signal processing techniques. In this paper. vibration analysis techniques are used for condition monitoring in gear fault. This analysis can be used for measuring the characteristics for a perfectly working gearbox and used the data as a standard for measuring faults and defects in other gearboxes. The objective of this paper is to design and fabrication of a gearbox for motor current analysis system at different gear operations on different load conditions. Current signatures are tested for during different gear operations. Also the minimum power required to run different gears are determined by using different loads.

Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is one of the most popular technique that is employed to access and compare the images of people in terms of Color and Texture features. The CBIR is applied on the images like Humans. Vehicles. Medical Images. Living Animals etc. that are too complex in nature. This has been motivated for the development of the proposed Region Based Retrieval Method (RBRM) matching approach that comprises of three consecutive steps. They are: Initailly. an image is divided into three parts ie head. trunk and leg regions. Then color. texture and shape descriptors for each sub images are calculated and finally. the distance between query and database images are estimated using similarity measure.

8902,Bioethanol production from Wheat straw by popping pretreatment,2014,Vinod Kumar and PK Chauhan and Virender Singh,2,Octa Journal of Biosciences,2,,Scientific Planet Society,Excessive consumption of fossil fuels. particularly in large urban areas. has resulted in generation of high levels of pollution during the last few decades. The level of greenhouse gasses in the earth's atmosphere has drastically increased (Ballesteros et al 2006). Ethanol is one of the best tools to fight vehicular pollution. contains 35% oxygen that helps complete combustion of fuel and thus reduces harmful tailpipe emissions. It also reduces particulate emissions that pose a health hazard. Bioethanol is currently produced primarily from sugar and starch sourced from crops (first-generation biomass) such as sugar cane. wheat and corn. which have a high concentration of sugar (Kim 2004.. Naik et al 2010). However. because these crops are also important food sources bioethanol produced from them can have a significant impact on food prices and food security (Naik et al 2010). But wheat straw has a high potential as sustainable biomass source in India based on its abundance and low cost. Wheat straw is a good raw material for ethanol production. since wheat straw has a rather high content of cellulose. The cellulose in biomass can be hydrolysed to sugars that can be fermented into ethanol. Wheat straw has a rather large content of cellulose. roughly 34%(Alfaniet al 200).India. with a GDP of about USD 475 billion. is the fifth largest economy in the world. Seventy two percent of India's people live in rural areas and about 70% earn their livelihood from agriculture.

8909,Analysis of Dilemma Zone for Crossing Pedestrians at Uncontrolled Midblock Sections,2014,Digvijay Sampatrao Pawar and Vinit Kumar and Navdeep Singh and Gopal R Patil,,,14-4475,,,Pedestrians are vulnerable and are at risk whenever they share road space with vehicular traffic. The risk to pedestrians is especially high in countries like India; where a large number of pedestrians are seen on roads and vehicle traffic usually do not yield to them. Therefore it is common that the most of the victims of road accidents. especially in urban areas. in India are pedestrians. One of the primary reasons for accidents at pedestrian crossing (when drivers do not yield to pedestrians) is the inability to judge safe gap while crossing a road. Often pedestrians are in state of confusion/dilemma while making a decision whether to accept or reject a gap. Under these circumstances. decision making for pedestrians during road crossing is usually a tough task. This paper aims at analyzing and quantifying dilemma zone for crossing pedestrians. A field study was undertaken in which crossing pedestrians and through moving vehicles were recorded using video cameras at selected midblock road sections having marked pedestrian crossing. Total of 1107 pedestrian gaps are extracted and studied; both temporal and spatial gaps are considered for analysis. Dilemma zone is determined by using different methods. namely. gap cumulative distribution method. binary logit method. support vector machine. and probabilistic method. For the selected midblock sections. dilemma zone starts at 50m and ends at 60m upstream from the marked pedestrian crossing. The authors believe marking the dilemma zone in the field or warning pedestrians when a vehicle enters the dilemma zone will help the pedestrian in making better decision thereby improving …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:5fCWA2nXjDoC,1,https://trid.trb.org/view/1289403,14552171301615167346,/scholar?cites=14552171301615167346,,,0

Haryana Agricultural University,The purpose of this study was to evaluate the oxidative and colour stability of raw ground pork incorporated with 1%(w/v) of different Matteuccia struthiopteris (Fiddle head fern) extracts viz. acetone (AF). ethanol (EF). methanol (MF) and water (WF) during refrigerated storage for 9 days. Total phenolic content. 1. 1 diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil (DPPH) radicals and 2-2-azinobis-3-ethylbenthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS+) radical activity were the highest in AF and the lowest in WF. Fiddle head (FH)-treated raw ground pork had significantly lower thiobarbituric acid reactive substances than control (raw pork samples without any treatment) during storage. Amongst treatments. the antioxidant efficacy followed an order of WF< MF< EF< AF. Raw ground pork meat incorporated with AF and EF exhibited a decrease in L* Lovibond’s colour values. The pH and aw value were higher in control than FH-treated products and followed an increasing trend throughout the storage. Therefore. it can be concluded that acetone and ethanolic extracts of fiddle head fern can be used successfully as an antioxidant to minimize lipid peroxidation and colour deteriorative changes in raw ground pork products.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:l8DKPopc-98C,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rajesh_Wagh2/publication/325415503_6_2/data/5b0cf5304585157f871ccf3f/6-2.pdf,11482251035309373234,/scholar?cites=11482251035309373234,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rajesh_Wagh2/publication/325415503_6_2/data/5b0cf5304585157f871ccf3f/6-2.pdf,0

Unfortunately. some of climatic variables. especially relative humidity. solar radiation and wind speed are often missing which could impede the estimation of ETO with the FAO-56 PM method. To overcome the problem of availability of climatic variables. procedures to estimate ETO with missing climate data are proposed as part of the FAO methodology. Therefore. assessing the accuracy of these procedures for Pusa Observatory is important.The comparison of ETO estimates using limited data to those computed with full data set revealed that the difference between ETO obtained from full and limited data set is small. Both the Mean Bias Error (MBE) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the comparison were less than 0.35 and 1.00 with a minimum of “0.11 and 0.29 mm day” 1. respectively. leading to small errors in the ETO estimates.

8934,Traffic and congestion control in ATM networks using neuro-fuzzy approach,2012,Suriti Gupta and Vinod Kumar,,"IJCA special issue on Communication Security,(1)",,,,In this paper. a neuro-fuzzy based Call Admission Control (CAC) algorithm for ATM networks has been simulated. The algorithm presented employs neuro-fuzzy approach to calculate the bandwidth require to support multimedia traffic with QoS requirements. The neuro-fuzzy based CAC calculates bandwidth required per call using measurements of the traffic via its count-process. instead of relying on simple parameters such as the peak. average bit rate and burst length.

However. epistemic uncertainty regarding the exact nature of biological systems can complicate the calibration of models and simulations that attempt to capture their structure and behaviour. and can obscure the interpretation of simulation-derived experimental results with respect to the real domain. We present an approach to the calibration of an agent-based model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). a mouse proxy for multiple sclerosis (MS). which harnesses interaction between a modeller and domain expert in mitigating uncertainty in the data derived from the real domain. A novel uncertainty analysis technique is presented that. in conjunction with a latin hypercube-based global sensitivity analysis. can indicate the implications of epistemic uncertainty in the real domain.

The sand behavior was assumed to be non-associative isotropic elastic perfectly plastic and the cone-sand interaction was simulated with a rigid-plastic frictional model. Extreme distortion of sand around the cone was handled with autoadaptive remeshing. Analytical results obtained in this study indicate that normalized cone tip resistance is strongly influenced by friction and dilation angles but the relationships depend on lateral earth pressure. The ratio of cone tip resistance and small strain shear modulus was also found to depend strongly on friction and dilation angles but the relationships are independent of lateral earth pressure.

The spallation neutron spectrum falls over a nuclear fuel in an ADS. Thus. for an arbitrary nuclear fuel. production and absorption cross sections of neutrons would vary with the incident neutron energy and the criticality coefficient. keff is expected to behave differently to a thermal or the fast reactor. For developing methods of estimation of keff in an ADS. let us assume that there is a cylindrical spallation target of dimension dx L= 20x50 cm2 enclosed in side a fuel blanket of thickness X. The energy spectra of spallation neutrons produced in collision of 1GeV proton with a thick lead target is simulated using the CASCADE code [1] and the standard neutron spectra [2] of the thermal and a fast reactor have been used to estimate the spectrum average cross sections of different reactions occurring in different fuel elements such as 232Th and 235U of an arbitrarily assumed fuel system of an ADS.

A variant drainage pattern of the venous blood from the left kidney was found. It was drained by two renal veins. At the hilum. one was lying in front of the ureter and the other behind. These two were joined by a communicating channel. The anterior vein crossed the aorta. running superficial to it and drained into the IVC but the posterior vein followed a retro-aortic course and drained into the IVC. Thus. the 2 veins formed a circumaortic collar. We also report an accessory renal artery and the anomalous arrangement of hilar structures on the left side. The arrangement of the hilar structures from anterior to posterior was accessory renal artery. anterior renal vein. left renal artery. ureter and the posterior renal vein.

The indulgence of men in sexual activities both within and outside marriage determines the actual fertility performance of men. Men belonging to backward classes are continuously under stress particularly in matters of sexuality and fertility due to social and cultural problems. Therefore a study of the relation between male fertility and sexuality of certain minority populations such as Scheduled caste and tribe and the Muslim populations has been chosen. Fertility in these communities in general is influenced by socio-cultural factors. However. social and cultural factors have roots in economic factors. Owing to poverty and lack of education the decisions of men on fertility are affected.

The dynamics of femtosecond optical pulses in such dispersive and nonlinear materials provide a truly challenging measurement task. but reward us with most spectacular images of nonlinear wave interactions.

A natural quadric shell can be thought of as a solid defined by a natural quadric surface and its offset (which is again a quadric). Thus. the intersection of quadric shells is essentially the same as the set of intersections of quadric surfaces and their offsets. An approach is presented to obtain the intersection of any two offset surfaces (of the initial quadrics) in terms of the offset distances. For the intersection of any two shells (which contain the initial quadrics as one of their surfaces). the intersection curve can be obtained directly by substituting the appropriate shell thickness (offset distances) in the general solution.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:vLQLSqXM-2MC,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010448594000093,3474067850022664924,/scholar?cites=3474067850022664924,,,0

8988,The Indianness of Ezekiel's' Indian English'Poems: An Analysis,1987,Vinoda Kumar and Shiv Kumar,9,Kunapipi,1,5,,The response of scholars to Ezekiel's' Indian English'poems has always alternated between amusement and disapproval; very few have taken them seriously enough to see that they bring into sharp focus the sensibility that informs the characteristic Indian modes of thought and behaviour. It seems as if the comedy of the low-grade Indian English employed by the poet as an artistic strategy in these poems has altogether distracted attention away from the underlying purpose. The apparently light-hearted treatment of the subject in them has led scholars to think that the poet has' quietly gone to seed'.^ Even when occasionally a perceptive scholar like Sivaramakrishna feels that the'ultimate significance'of Ezekiel's' Indian English'poems has not often been realised. he merely regards them as symptomatic of the predicament of Indo-English poets' whoring after English gods'.^ This view leaves much to be said about the'significance'of these poems.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:N1VmUGXLVVwC,1,https://ro.uow.edu.au/kunapipi/vol9/iss1/5/,10637912315399511761,/scholar?cites=10637912315399511761,,https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1668&context=kunapipi,0

The diffrae-tion curves of Czochralski grown crystals were observed to consist of several peaks separated by a few minutes of arc from each other and extending over several minutes of arc. This observation reveals the presence of low angle boundaries in these crystals. Topographs of this type of crystals were recorded by aligning them for most intense diffraction peak in their diffraction curve. These topographs also show the presence of low angle boundaries. The angles of mis-set between adjoining subgrain were determined. The value of the angle is approximately 2 minutes of arc. Therefore. it is seen that these crystals are not perfeot crystals. The perfection of CVD grown aAl203 crystals was found to vary with distance from the seed. Regions surrounding the seed were found to be imperfect like the Czochralski grown crystals. Those regions which were away from the seed were found to be nearly perfect crystals. These oontain few isolated dislocations. These dislocations were characterised by using gb oontrast analysis.

Ezetimibe and internal standard. Ezetimibe-D4. were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with Diethyl ether and Dichloromethane (70: 30 v/v). The high performance liquid chromatographic separation was performed on a Discovery C18. 150x 4.6 mm. 5µ column using a mobile phase composed of Acetonitrile 40: 60 (v/v)-10mM Ammonium formate buffer (pH 4.0±0.3) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Tandem mass spectrometry was performed in the Electrospray ionization (ESI) negative ion mode. using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode for the quantification. The mass transition pairs of m/z 408.40→ 271.0 for ezetimibe and m/z 412.10→ 275.10 for internal standard were used. The calibration curve was linear in the concentration range of 4.00 ng/mL-400.00 ng/mL for total ezetimibe with the lower limit of quantification of 4.00 ng/mL for total ezetimibe.

However. understanding of the factors that control SST variability is lacking. especially during the monsoons when in situ observations are sparse. Here we use a ground-breaking observational approach to determine the controls on the SST variability in the southern Bay of Bengal. We achieve this through the first full closure of the ocean mixed layer energy budget derived entirely from in situ observations during the Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE). Locally measured horizontal advection and entrainment contribute more significantly than expected to SST evolution and thus oceanic variability during the observation period.

9021,Bioproduction of succinic acid from xylose by engineered Yarrowia lipolytica without pH control,2020,V Kumar and A Prabhu and RL Amaro and CSK Lin and F Coulon and Thakur Vk,,,,,,Background Xylose is a most prevalent sugar available in hemicellulose fraction of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) and of great interest for the green economy. Unfortunately. most of the cell factories cannot inherently metabolize xylose as sole carbon source. Yarrowia lipolytica is a non-conventional yeast to produce industrially important metabolites. and it is able to metabolize a large variety of substrates including both hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbon sources. However. Y. lipolytica lacks effective metabolic pathway for xylose uptake and only scarce information is available on utilization of xylose. For the economically feasible of LCB-based biorefineries. effective utilization of both pentose and hexose sugars is obligatory. Results In the present study. succinic acid (SA) production from xylose by Y. lipolytica was examined. To this end. Y. lipolytica PSA02004 strain was engineered by overexpressing pentose pathway cassette comprising of xylose reductase (XR). xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) and xylulose kinase (XK) gene. The recombinant strain exhibited a robust growth on xylose as sole carbon source and accumulated SA (3.8 g/L) with a yield of 0.19 g/g in shake flask studies. Substrate inhibition studies revealed a marked negative impact on cell growth and product formation above 60 g/L xylose concentration. The modelling based on inhibition kinetics revealed that Aiba model showed better fit with experimental data. which resulted the correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0.82 and inhibition constant (KI) 88.9 g/L. The batch cultivation of recombinant strain in bioreactor resulted in a maximum biomass concentration of 7.3 g/L and SA titer of 11.2 g …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:D1NYUzbdKDgC,0,https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr134296,,,,,0

According to the US Department of Energy. xylitol is among the twelve platform chemicals that can be produced from biomass. The chemical method for xylitol synthesis is however expensive and energy intensive. In contrast. the biological route involving microbial cell factories offers a potential cost-effective alternative process. The bioprocess occurs under ambient conditions and makes use of biocatalysts which can be sourced from renewable carbon coming from a variety of cheap feedstocks classified as wastes. Result: In this study. biotransformation of xylose to xylitol was investigated using Yarrowia lipolytica an oleaginous yeast grown on glycerol/glucose screening of primary carbon source. media optimisation in shake flask. scale up in bioreactor and downstream processing of xylitol were carried out. With the two step medium optimization involving central composite design and artificial neural network coupled with genetic algorithm. the yeast amassed 53.2 g/L of xylitol using glycerol and xylose with a bioconversion yield of 0.97 g/g. Similar results were obtained when pure glycerol was substituted with crude glycerol from biodiesel industry (titer: 50.5 g/L; yield: 0.92 g/g). Even when xylose from lignocellulosic hydrolysate was used as opposed to pure xylose. a xylitol yield of 0.54 g/g was achieved. Xylitol was successfully crystallized from fermented broth using pure glycerol/xylose and crude glycerol/xylose with a recovery of 35 and 39.45%. respectively.

The switch is fabricated on a high-resistivity silicon substrate (ρ = 10.000 Ω cm. εr = 11.7. h = 675 µm) using bulk micro-machined techniques. A novel symmetrical tri-layer sandwich (insulator–metal–insulator) concept is implemented in membrane design which results in stress-free membrane and thus results in lower actuation voltage of 15V. The inductive effect created in the CPW ground not only brings down the resonant frequency which eliminates the need to increase the membrane length but also improves the isolation (> 40 dB). This electrostatically actuated switch has measured insertion loss and isolation of 1.51 dB and 46.42 dB at 20.25 GHz. respectively.

Here. we propose a detailed neurobiologically realistic model that captures the neural mechanisms of inter-individual variability observed in cross-modal speech perception. From raw EEG signals recorded from human participants when they were presented with speech vocalizations of McGurk-incongruent and congruent audio-visual (AV) stimuli. we computed the global coherence metric to capture the neural variability of large-scale networks. We identified that participants McGurk susceptibility was negatively correlated to their alpha-band global coherence.  The proposed biophysical model conceptualized the global coherence dynamics emerge from coupling between the interacting neural masses - representing the sensory specific auditory/visual areas and modality non-specific associative/integrative regions.  Subsequently. we could predict that an extremely weak direct AV coupling result in a decrease in alpha band global coherence - mimicking the cortical dynamics of participants with higher McGurk susceptibility. Source connectivity analysis also showed decreased connectivity between sensory specific regions in participants more susceptible to McGurk effect. thus establishing an empirical validation to the prediction.  Overall. our study provides an outline to link variability in structural and functional connectivity metrics to variability of performance that can be useful for several perception & action task paradigms.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:APzTi3oVP6kC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/819896v2.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/04/07/819896.full.pdf,0

Rice genotypes were subjected to different doses (0. 30. 60. 90. 120 ppm) of paclobutrazol. Study revealed that relative water content. membrane stability index. total chlorophyll and abscisic acid content significantly increased by application of PBZ in contrasting rice genotypes. ie Nagina-22 (drought-tolerant genotype). IR-64 (drought sensitive) and IR-64 DTY1. 1 [drought-tolerant. near isogenic line of IR-64 developed by the introgression of a major QTL (qDTY1. 1)] under polyethylene glycol mediated water deficit stress. The increase was found to be of higher magnitude in 90 ppm dose of paclobutrazol compared to other doses. Our results suggest that PBZ application could significantly improve tolerance in rice genotypes particularly susceptible genotype under limited water availability through selective changes in physio-biochemical parameters.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:-PunKREE7LAC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nitin_Garg16/publication/337413928_Paclobutrazol_induced_physio-biochemical_manifestations_to_ameliorate_water_deficit_stress_in_rice_Oryza_sativa/links/5eeb39d5458515814a6768b0/Paclobutrazol-induced-physio-biochemical-manifestations-to-ameliorate-water-deficit-stress-in-rice-Oryza-sativa.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nitin_Garg16/publication/337413928_Paclobutrazol_induced_physio-biochemical_manifestations_to_ameliorate_water_deficit_stress_in_rice_Oryza_sativa/links/5eeb39d5458515814a6768b0/Paclobutrazol-induced-physio-biochemical-manifestations-to-ameliorate-water-deficit-stress-in-rice-Oryza-sativa.pdf,0

The analysis is performed using data from proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV. collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb −1 . The observed data are consistent with standard model expectations. The results are interpreted in the context of two physics models. The first model involves right-handed charged bosons. W R . that decay to heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos. N ℓ (ℓ = e. μ. τ). arising in a left-right symmetric extension of the standard model. The model considers that N e and N μ are too heavy to be detected at the LHC. Assuming that the N τ mass is half of the W R mass. masses of the W R boson below 3.50 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. Exclusion limits are also presented considering different scenarios for the mass ratio between N τ and W R . as a function of W R mass. In the second model. pair production of third-generation scalar leptoquarks that decay into ττbb is considered. resulting in an observed exclusion region with leptoquark masses below 1.02 TeV. assuming a 100% branching fraction for the leptoquark decay to a τ lepton and a bottom quark. These results represent the most stringent limits to date on these models.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019.

Cham,Contaminations of heavy metals and dyes are a global concern due to their higher toxicity and carcinogenicity. Removal of heavy metals and dyes from aqueous solution by adsorption is a promising technology. Biological methods have advantages over chemical methods. Fungus serves as a biosorbent due to its high metal and dye adsorption capacities. A number of functional groups on the surface of the fungal biosorbent pay a key role in the adsorption of heavy metals and dyes. The beneficial effects of immobilized fungi are based on the fact that high concentrations of the fungi may imply high volumetric productivities. The immobilized fungus is easy to be separated from other components in the reaction mixture. simplifying downstream processing. and more importantly. it can then be used repeatedly and continuously.

Although there are large exchanges of carbon dioxide (CO2) between the atmosphere and agricultural ecosystems. emissions are thought to be roughly balanced by uptake. giving a net flux of only around 0.04 Pg CO2 yr-1. less than 1% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions (Smith et al.. 2007a).

If indirect emissions from agrochemical production and distribution and on-farm operations. including irrigation. are also included. an extra 0.4-1.6 Pg CO2-eq yr-1 (0.8-3.2%) can be attributed to agriculture. meaning that. in total. direct and indirect emissions from agricultural activity and land use change to agricultural use could contribute as much as 32.2% of all GHG emissions (Bellarby et al.. 2008). Agriculture is the main source of global non CO2 GHG emissions. contributing around 47% of anthropogenic CH4 emissions and 58% of N2O. although there is a large degree of uncertainty around estimates for both agricultural contribution and total anthropogenic emissions. The main sources. N2O from soils and CH4 from enteric fermentation. make up around 70% of non-CO2 emissions from the sector. with …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:Nc8Yq6u9GesC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rk_Naresh/publication/332573187_Conservation_Tillage_and_Residue_Management_towards_Low_Greenhouse_Gas_Emission_Storage_and_Turnover_of_Natural_Organic_Matter_in_Soil_under_Sub-tropical_Ecosystems_A_Review/links/5cbeea21a6fdcc1d49a89765/Conservation-Tillage-and-Residue-Management-towards-Low-Greenhouse-Gas-Emission-Storage-and-Turnover-of-Natural-Organic-Matter-in-Soil-under-Sub-tropical-Ecosystems-A-Review.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rk_Naresh/publication/332573187_Conservation_Tillage_and_Residue_Management_towards_Low_Greenhouse_Gas_Emission_Storage_and_Turnover_of_Natural_Organic_Matter_in_Soil_under_Sub-tropical_Ecosystems_A_Review/links/5cbeea21a6fdcc1d49a89765/Conservation-Tillage-and-Residue-Management-towards-Low-Greenhouse-Gas-Emission-Storage-and-Turnover-of-Natural-Organic-Matter-in-Soil-under-Sub-tropical-Ecosystems-A-Review.pdf,0

In the data. the muons are removed from reconstructed nn events and replaced with simulated tau leptons with the same kinematic properties. In this way. a set of hybrid events is obtained that does not rely on simulation except for the decay of the tau leptons. The challenges in describing the underlying event or the production of associated jets in the simulation are avoided. The technique described in this paper was developed for CMS. Its validation and the inherent uncertainties are also discussed.

9157,Low energy ultrasonic single beacon localization for testing of scaled model vehicle,2019,Awanish C Dubey and V Anantha Subramanian and V Jagadeesh Kumar,9,Ocean Systems Engineering,4,391-407,Techno-Press,Tracking the location (position) of a surface or underwater marine vehicle is important as part of guidance and navigation. While the Global Positioning System (GPS) works well in an open sea environment but its use is limited whenever testing scaled-down models of such vehicles in the laboratory environment. This paper presents the design. development and implementation of a low energy ultrasonic augmented single beacon-based localization technique suitable for such requirements. The strategy consists of applying Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to achieve location tracking from basic dynamic distance measurements of the moving model from a fixed beacon. while on-board motion sensor measures heading angle and velocity. Iterative application of the Extended Kalman Filter yields x and y co-ordinate positions of the moving model. Tests performed on a free-running ship model in a wave basin facility of dimension 30 m by 30 m by 3 m water depth validate the proposed model. The test results show quick convergence with an error of few centimeters in the estimated position of the ship model. The proposed technique has application in the real field scenario by replacing the ultrasonic sensor with industrial grade long range acoustic modem. As compared with the existing systems such as LBL. SBL. USBL and others localization techniques. the proposed technique can save deployment cost and also cut the cost on number of acoustic modems involved.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:tfFR5hCbSrAC,0,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201911362304694.page,,,,,0

India,The hydrogen detection is an important issue for the societal acceptance of H2 as energy carrier. In present research work. we have investigated hydrogen sensing and optical properties of Pd/Mg thin films on glass substrate deposited by pulsed laser (PL). As-deposited thin films have been exposed (hydrogenation) to H2 gas (2 bar) at room temperature in a hydrogenation unit. Hydrogenated and dehydrogenated (at different temperatures) samples have been characterized using X-ray diffractometer (XRD). field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. atomic force microscopy (AFM). XRD results confirm the formation of hydride (MgH2) tetragonal phase upon hydrogenation of Pd/Mg films. Hydrogen induced resistance response of Pd/Mg films has been measured in-situ during hydrogenation/dehydrogenation process by using two- probe electrical method. The response time (sensitivity) of Pd/Mg films for hydrogen gas is ~ 60 s at room temperature.

9163,SIMULATION ANALYSIS OF POWER CONTROL USING DROOP CONTROL METHOD IN AC-DC MICROGRID,2019,V ANIL KUMAR and M SEKHAR and V SURYA PRAKASH and M RAVI KUMAR,6,SIMULATION,01,,,Due to the fast proliferation of distributed generators (DGs) in power systems. managing the power of different DGs and the grid has become crucial. and microgrid provides a promising solution. Therefore. focus on ac and dc microgrids has grown rapidly with their architectural. modeling. stability analysis and enhancement. power quality improvement. power sharing control. and other issues. Most developments mentioned above on micro grids are. however. directed at DG control mainly within one microgrid.Enforcing ac and dc microgrids inter tied by an interlinking power converter is a promising topology in future power networks. and has in fact been discussed recently due to some benefits. such as greater security and reliability. and reduced transmission and distribution losses. Autonomous operation and modified droop control schemes of such hybrid microgrids were discussed in and extended in and by integrating an energy storage system to the dc microgrid. Another droop control scheme was followed in for bidirectional power flow between the inter-tied microgrids. In. hierarchical control of multiple parallel ac-dc converter interfaces between ac and dc buses was proposed to achieve proportional current sharing. Despite the progress mentioned above. some drawbacks of the previous methods can also be found.(i) The majority of the existing inner loop control techniques are greatly dependent on mathematical model. These techniques cannot give satisfactory results when suffering poor model.

Evaporative cooling makes sure of the evaporation of water to reduce the inlet air temperature of the compressor. The model used for the evaporative cooler panels is based on the energy balance of ambient air and cooling water. Inlet air cooling increases the power output by taking advantage of the gas turbine’s feature of higher mass flow rate. due to compressor inlet air temperature decays. As the specific volume of air is directly proportional to the temperature. the increases in the air density result in a higher air mass flow rate. once the volumetric rate is constant. The effects of the parameter (design and operation condition) on the power output. compression work. specific fuel consumption. and thermal efficiency are evaluated and compared with simple gas turbine cycle.

This study is an attempt to understand the impacts of addition of one or more covariates in longterm covariance analysis. Out of the 29 years grain yield data. those years with more than ten outliers were discarded and remaining 21 years’ data used for further study. The ordinary pooled analysis and ANCOVA based on one covariate. two covariates. three covariates and four covariates studied. In the initial pooled analysis. the treatment sum of squares was very large and by the addition of covariates one by one. the treatment sum of squares reduced and arrived at a stable value. Whereas the MSE (error variance) value. remain stable even after accounting for two or more covariates.

With the new trends of Web 2.0 and e-governance 2.0. e-governance developers have moved to rich Internet applications [2]. ICT is an emerging computing paradigm that provides a variety of services in such a way that has not been experienced before. e-Governance as an ICT service (SaaS) can be one among them [3]. Availability and affordability of government related services to the public is an important factor for sustainable development [4]. The importance of good governance. especially in developing countries such as India. is increasing because of the pressure to chase the developed world. that is. global competitiveness [5]. Typically. infrastructure availability is different in developing countries than in developed countries. for example. a low quality of education and fewer possibilities to have computers. the Internet. or mobile phones in rural areas because of long distances and high costs [6].The uses of ICT in the e-governance domain have many benefits. In the existing system in government organizations. it is very difficult to exchange information between different suborganizations [7]. For instance. data from the election commission cannot be easily shared with the police and defense sections. When a situation arises. it has to go through levels of bureaucracy and authorization. and a lot of paperwork. to finally acquire the required information. which wastes a huge amount of resources and time [8].

9181,1352. A Computational Approach for Exploring the Binding Mechanism of Chebulinic Acid on Herpes Simplex Virus-2 and Its Implication on Chikungunya and Dengue,2018,Naiju Thomas and Sandeep Kumar and Vikas Kumar and Suman Tapryal,5,Open Forum Infectious Diseases,Suppl 1,S414,Oxford University Press,Background. Chebulinic acid (CA). a natural compound isolated from the tree Terminalia chebula. was recently reported to have shown antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2). The study showed inhibition activity of CA. preventing the attachment of HSV-2 on the host cells. This activity was speculated to be due to an interaction between CA and viral surface glycoproteins. triggering alterations in its function or making virus particles inert and preventing their attachment to host cells. However. the mechanism of this inhibition was not established. The current study was designed not only to help gain insights of the mechanism of action of CA on HSV-2. but also to computationally check its binding affinity on other enveloped arboviruses. ie. Chikungunya (ChikV) and Dengue (DenV). Methods. The viral surface glycoproteins of HSV-2. ChikV. and DenV were subjected to molecular docking with CA using the software. AutoDock Vina. Protein–protein docking was performed with ClusPro online server to elucidate the specific site and residues involved in binding between viral protein and human host receptors. Due to unavailability of crystal structure of Prohibitin. a human receptor for ChikV. structural modeling was performed with i-Tasser server. Results. The conformations obtained after docking showed good hydrogen bond interactions with a docking energy of− 9.3.− 8.1. and− 8.8 kcal/mol against HSV-2. ChikV. and DenV. respectively. In all three viruses. CA was found to bind specifically at the site directly involved in host attachment. suggesting a possible mechanism of action by which CA inhibits the viral attachment that is consistent …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:crhHmGRhyBgC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/96b5/3608e0169ef851710e6c9e8cca9249ca2a4d.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/96b5/3608e0169ef851710e6c9e8cca9249ca2a4d.pdf,0

Ltd.,Context: Despite advances in understanding into the pathophysiology of chronic hepatitis B. liver biopsy evaluation on H&E stained sections has stood the test of time. There is therefore. a need to re-visit the most commonly used scoring systems with an aim to look for an ideal semi-quantitative system which is objective. simple to apply and versatile enough to incorporate newer advances.Aims: To compare various semi-quantitative scoring systems with a view to (a) look for consistency in reporting.(b) assess usefulness in follow-up and (c) recommend a scoring system that is practical and easy to apply. Settings and Design: Chronic hepatitis B was defined as HBsAg positive status for at least six months. All liver biopsies were evaluated using semi-quantitative scoring systems viz the Knodell. Ishak’s modified HAI and Scheuer systems. Materials and Methods: Baseline biopsies were assessed for intra-and inter-observer variation in order to find the system best suited for routine use. The observer variation was also calculated separately for portal. peri-portal and lobular inflammation as well as for fibrosis.Statistical Analysis used: A Kappa analysis up to 95% confidence interval was done to look for statistical significance of interand intra-observer agreement between the three scoring systems. Results: On multivariate Kappa analysis. it was found that both inter-and intra-observer agreement were comparable in the Knodell and Ishak systems. and was significantly better with the Scheuer system.

In order to evaluate lung compliance accurately. clinicians must conduct inspiratory holds and prevent spontaneous inspiration to determine airway plateau pressure (PPlat) and static lung compliance (CS). Although monitoring CS is advised for optimal lung-protective ventilation strategies. it is rarely done due to the patient burden of inspiratory holds. We hypothesize that a novel endotracheal tube (ETT) with a distal airway pressure (PD) sensor that bypasses flow-dependent airway resistance can report PD equivalent to PPlat for the real-time monitoring of CS.

Productivity of this crop is rigorously limited due to prevailing environmental stress particularly. salinity stress. Climate changes raise the serious concern to develop improved mungbean cultivars with more adaptability and resistance towards salinity stress. Present study aimed to screen 15 mungbean accessions for salt tolerance under different salinity treatments ie EC4. 0. EC7. 0. EC10. 0 and EC16. 0 (dS/m) along with control (EC0) at early seedling growth stage. The seed germination% and early seedling growth characteristics ie radical. plumule and total seedling length. dry weight of the seedlings. seedling vigor and salt stress index on 4th day after germination (DAG) were investigated. The result showed that all traits decreased gradually with increasing level of salt stress in all the genotypes. The genotypes showed variations for all the measured features within themselves and at different salt stress levels. The radical length was found to be more adversely affected due to salinity stress as compared to the plumule length during the first developmental stage of crop plants. The optimization of salt stress level was done below EC10. 0 dS/m for mungbean salt tolerance studies. The seedling vigor was found to be more desirable criterion on the basis of which available crop germplasm can be screened for salt tolerance.

Sensors generate sensitive data in many applications and thus methods to secure the data so as to prevent easy access by unauthorized agents are essential. Security against false data injection or data tampering can be provided through encryption of sensor data; but it increases load on processing. Securing data. however. puts a burden on the node battery. Data aggregation aims both at data reduction so as to spend less time for encryption as well as reduce transmission load. but demanding additional processing at aggregating node. Thus. aggregation and security are contradictory solutions.

First. TD solution is considered for corner amplitude diffraction by edges of a flat plate. and then for corner slope diffraction (CSD) which takes into account the finiteness of the plate edges. To show the significance of CSD. results have been shown for diffraction of ultra-wideband signals by edges of a horn antenna which is a structure made by interconnected flat plates. The comparison between the TD solution and the numerical inverse fast Fourier transform of the corresponding frequency-domain solution validates the proposed solution.

FTIR and Raman spectroscopic techniques to reveal the change in the optical behaviour of the samples in terms of induced structural changes in the polymer as a result of ion irradiation. The observed decrease in optical energy gap and increase in refractive index of the material under study after irradiation to Ar+ and Kr+ ions at the same energy have been tried to explain in terms of the energy loss profile along the trajectory of the respective ions. These studies are quite important towards the development of new materials with desired properties besides their fundamental importance.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:2adpFNImVzkC,0,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/360/1/012033/meta,,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/360/1/012033/pdf,0

9196,Dynamic Evaluation of the Economic and Environmental Impact of Resource Depletion for a New Chemical Project,2018,Vinod Vijay Kumar and Andrew Hoadley and Yogendra Shastri,70,Chemical Engineering Transactions,,1177-1182,,The availability of abiotic resources is still critical to the rapidly growing human population. and rising living standards. Standard methodologies are needed to account for the depletion of resources. Some of the methods for resource depletion evaluation consider replacement of a scarce resource with an alternative resource but do not consider a time frame for the same. However. resource substitution is decided by several factors such as resource costs and price elasticity of demand. which are dynamic. Moreover. the existing methods do not consider a driving force for the replacement to occur and do not analyse the long-term consequences of resource scarcity. In this paper. a dynamic resource depletion methodology is proposed. and it has been applied to a case study of natural gas scarcity in New Zealand. A system dynamics model predicts the gas price and the rates of gas consumption over an extended period. The potential impacts are quantified using life cycle assessment (LCA) and are further aggregated into a resource depletion indicator that is based on environmental economics and decision-making perspectives for the environment. The wider economic and environmental impacts that are a result of a new chemical plant during a period of gas shortage are evaluated. With the functioning of the new plant. it was found that the rate of potential gas scarcity accelerated. leading to an increase in wider economic and environmental impacts. The discounted greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased by 21%. 30% and 36% for the individualist. hierarchist and egalitarian perspectives.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:Uett3gagOK8C,0,https://research.monash.edu/files/276912546/270684870_oa.pdf,,,,https://research.monash.edu/files/276912546/270684870_oa.pdf,0

Moreover. the significance of margin in the longevity of restoration and the effect of impression technique on marginal adaptation of restoration indicate the necessity of applying an accurate impression technique. Aim of the study: To compare one-step technique and two-step technique for making impressions using polyvinylsiloxane for FPD. Materials and methods: The present study was conducted in the Department of Dentistry. Shridevi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Hospital. Tumkur. Karnataka. India. We selected 35 patients reporting to the Department clinic for fixed partial denture (FPD) as their dental treatment for the study group. The age of the subjects ranged from 22-60 years. For each patient. two different techniques with polyvinylsiloxane impression material were performed for making master impression. The techniques were i) technique 1 was single stage double mix technique; and technique 2 was two stage technique with spacer. Results: We observed that number of patients with defects in Technique 1 were 14 and in technique 2 were 15. The most common defect was voids in impression in both the techniques. The results on comparison were observed to be statistically non-significant (p> 0.05). Conclusion: The one step technique and two-step technique using polyvinlylsiloxane are equally effective for impression making.

The polymorphism information content (PIC) values ranged from 0.278 to 0.642 with an average of 0.465. The PIC values revealed that RM527 might be the best marker for identification and diversity estimation of aromatic rice genotypes followed by RM1. RM22565 and RM207 markers. At a 40% level of similarity. the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) cluster dendrogram showed three major clusters (I. II and III) with additional sub-clusters. except cluster III. The cluster III had only one genotype Bas 837 which showed 63% dissimilarity with rest of the genotypes. At below sub-cluster level. about half of the genotypes exhibited more than 70% genetic similarities between genotypes which itself explains the existence of narrow genetic base among aromatic rice genotypes. The low to high degree of similarity among studied genotypes indicated high level of genetic diversity. and also the possibility of using these genotypes in breeding programmes targeted at improvement of elite aromatic rice varieties.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:BBcaknn8KDYC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d5ff/57d295635c1f6b0da21be7e613bb77ac1a39.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d5ff/57d295635c1f6b0da21be7e613bb77ac1a39.pdf,0

The eμ mass spectrum is also interpreted in terms of non-resonant contributions from quantum black-hole production in models with one to six extra spatial dimensions. and lower mass limits are found between 3.6 and 5.6 TeV. In all interpretations used in this analysis. the results of this search improve previous limits by about 1 TeV. These limits correspond to the most sensitive values obtained at colliders.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2018.

9261,Cryptography Using Contrast Enhancement,2018,MM Raghavendra and Satya Narayana Sharvani and Vijay Kumar and Venkata Raju,,,,,,The proposed method of cryptography using contrast enhancement consists of two processes-extraction and recovery. Very often. the communication is required to be secure when the data is sensitive. The existing methods such as the Difference Expansion and Expansion Embedding suffer from undesirable distortion. which makes these methods unsuitable or less reliable. These methods use FFT (fast fourier transform) and this may result in loosing the data at the receiver part. The technique used in proposed system is discrete wavelet transform to achieve data without any loss. The message is embedded into cover image based on key and then. the covered image is transmitted. In this proposed system. one first contribution is a histogram shifting modulation. which adaptively takes care of the image content using the image prediction-errors and. by considering their immediate neighbourhood. the proposed scheme inserts data in textured areas where other methods fail to do so. This method inserts the carrier (cover) in the textured area and thus reduces the distortion. It also increases the embedding capacity of the cover image. In that way. the message embedded and extractor remain synchronized for message extraction and image reconstruction.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:iI4frfBhC7MC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/57075583/2989.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/57075583/2989.pdf,0

The I-Gel and LMA-Supreme are both novel supraglottic airway devices which are disposable. cheap and aids the passage of gastric tube which helps in gastric drainage. Both the devices can be used as an adjunct to endotracheal intubation in patient with difficult airway. This prospective randomized. single blind study was designed to compare the supraglottic airway devices I-Gel and LMA-Supreme in patients undergoing general anaesthesia for elective surgeries. After obtaining the institutional ethical committee approval. 60 adult patients of ASA I and II physical status of either sex undergoing elective surgical procedures under general anaesthesia were randomly allocated into 2 groups. Group A I-Gel group (n= 30) and Group B LMA-Supreme (n= 30).The study showed no significant difference between the two groups based on demographic variables. The mean insertion time for LMA-Supreme is significantly lower than I-Gel (P< 0.05). The airway leak pressure was comparable between the two devices. The first attempt success rate and the ease of insertion was significantly better in LMA-Supreme than I-Gel (P< 0.05).

They also lose their distinct spindle morphology and become large and flat. After a certain number of population doubling. they enter into permanent cell cycle arrest. called senescence. This is a major roadblock for clinical use of hMSCs which demands large number of cells. A culture system is needed which can maintain the stemness of hMSCs over long term passages yet simple to use. In this study. we explore the role of substrate rigidity in maintaining stemness. hMSCs were serially passaged on TCP and 5.0 kPa poly-acrylamide gel for 20 population doubling. It was found that while on TCP. cell growth reached a plateau at cumulative population doubling (CPD) = 12.5. on 5 kPa gel. they continue to proliferate linearly till we monitored (CPD = 20). We also found that while on TCP. late passage MSCs lost their adipogenic potential. the same was maintained on soft gel. Cell surface markers related to MSCs were also unaltered. We demonstrated that this maintenance of stemness was correlated with delay in onset of senescence. which was confirmed by β-gal assay and by differential expression of two nuclear markers Lamin A and Lamin B. As preparation of poly-acrylamide gel is a simple. well established. and well standardized protocol. we believe that this system of cell expansion will be useful in therapeutic and research applications of hMSCs.hMSCs retain their stemness when expanded in vitro on soft …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:OQ9zOo_0HogC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/364059v1.full,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/364059v1.full,0

Total replacement of concrete is not possible due to no material plays the role of concrete in terms of strength. durability. and workability. To obtain the results. tests are conducted with respect to The Indian Standards for Mix Design IS 10262 (2009) and Scheme of Testing and Inspection-Bureau of Indian Standards to determine the compressive strength of concrete after heating at 200 C temperature for steel fibre Recycled Aggregate Concrete. The natural aggregate is replaced 20% by recycled aggregate and steel fibres are added by volume (0.5%. 1%. and 1.5%). Results of this tests supports the hypothesis that this type of Concrete Mix may be suitable for partial substitution after proper Mix Designing. Aim of this study is to suggest alternate low-cost and environment suitable building materials from industrial wastes in an economic way with good compressive strength than normal concrete.

The governing nonlinear equations are solved iteratively by a highly implicit finite difference scheme. In this paper. the results based on four models. viz the Darcy model. the Brinkman model. the non-Darcian model with nonlinear inertia and viscous terms. and also the non-Darcian model with viscous. nonlinear inertia and velocity square terms. are compared. It is seen that fin cooling is more effective at higher Grashof or Darcy numbers due to stronger convection effects. The local Nusselt number is observed to increase with the Grashof or Darcy numbers and decrease slightly with the conduction–convection parameter. The limitation of the Darcy’s law is observed at higher values of permeability when the non-Darcian models are more relevant.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:9TKaBlIwHecC,0,https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/zna/73/1/article-p35.xml,,,,,0

9310,Advertising in Recession: A Competitive Strategy to Crush Small Players,2017,Sachin Verma and Vineet Kumar,2,Catalyst,2,,,Advertising is an important part of marketing. it’sa form of communication that includes the name of the brand. its product or service and how that product or service could potentially benefit the consumer. Recession is a business cycle contraction. a general slowdown in economic activity over a period of time. Due to this slowdown organizations often tend to reduce their advertising budget. This paper attempts to throw a light on how innovative advertising can help the organizations generate recall of their brand and why sometimes it is necessary not to reduce the advertising budget during recession so that the brand comes out to be a stronger one when this economical slowdown is over. This is the real time when major companies can wipe out small competitors who won't be able to survive recession with help of innovative advertising strategy.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:uK3zKZX60NsC,0,http://cjm.baddiuniv.ac.in/journals/vol2i2/5.pdf,,,,http://cjm.baddiuniv.ac.in/journals/vol2i2/5.pdf,0

9312,End-to-End Navigation in Unknown Environments using Neural Networks,2017,Konstantinos Karydis and A Khan and C Zhang and N Atanasov and D Lee and V Kumar,,,,,,We investigate how a neural network can learn perception actions loops for navigation in unknown environments. Specifically. we consider how to learn to navigate in environments populated with cull-de-sacs that represent convex local minima that the robot could fall into instead of finding a set of feasible actions that take it to the goal. Traditional methods rely on maintaining a global map to solve the problem of over coming a long cul-de-sac. However. due to errors induced from local and global drift. it is highly challenging to maintain such a map for long periods of time. One way to mitigate this problem is by using learning techniques that do not rely on hand engineered map representations and instead output appropriate control policies directly from their sensory input. We first demonstrate that such a problem cannot be solved directly by deep reinforcement learning due to the sparse reward structure of the environment. Further. we demonstrate that deep supervised learning also cannot be used directly to solve this problem. We then investigate network models that offer a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised learning and highlight the significance of adding fully differentiable memory units to such networks. We evaluate our networks on their ability to generalize to new environments and show that adding memory to such networks offers huge jumps in performance.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:G9wvEplfBxAC,0,https://escholarship.org/content/qt9td7006d/qt9td7006d.pdf,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt9td7006d/qt9td7006d.pdf,0

After the invention of the first refrigerator. people started to gain more and more interest in using man made machines rather than natural ice for cooling food. The early refrigerator models in the 19th century made the foundation of the more functional and more stylized refrigerators in the future. Many kinds of refrigerator exist in our society today. each with its own distinct function. But the most commonly seen and utilized. Almost every American family equipped with a refrigerator no matter of its color. size or layout. it serves one primary purpose to keep our food fresh.

Many Mycobacteria can develop biofilm. a multicellular structure largely combining bacteria and their Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS). Biofilms proceeds through genetically programmed. distinct developmental stages signalled by intricate networks of communication among the constituent population and their environment. Biofilmrelevant infections are more persistent. resistant to most antibiotics. and more recalcitrant to host immunity. Non Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) are emergent pathogens whose importance in human health has been growing. Mycobacterium tuberculosis. the causative agent of tuberculosis. can develop biofilm. though whether M. tuberculosis can form biofilm within tuberculosis patients has yet to be determined. Most notable among these is an extraordinary level of tolerance to a variety of environmental stresses. including antibiotics. Although mycobacteria have long been observed to spontaneously form complex multicellular structures in vitro. it has only recently become apparent that these structures are not only formed through dedicated genetic pathways but are also tolerant to antibiotics. In this article. we review the recent advances in the understanding of mycobacterial biofilms in vitro.

In the world. wheat is known to be cultivated in at least 43 countries. China is the leading country in wheat cultivation and are followed by India. Thailand. Indonesia and USA and total production of wheat was 647 million tonnes under area of 218 million hectares with a productivity of 2960 kg/ha (FAO. 2012). It is the staple food for millions of Indians. particularly in north-western and northern parts of the country. It is recorded that the area (lakh/ha). production (million/tonnes) and yield (kg/ha) of India is 433.88. 93.50 and 3093 respectively (Annual Report. 2015-16).This production is made possible by the use of chemical fertilizers but prolonged use of these fertilizers has negative effect in soil fertility and productivity. Chemical fertilizers have been playing an important role in increasing the yield of crops to meet the needs of increasing population. But they are costly and prolonged use of it causes decline of soil fertility by damaging the physical. chemical characteristics and soil microbial population. The effects include decline in total organic carbon (TOC). basic cation content and pH of the soil. Besides all these it also resulted in population decline of soil microbial biomass. bacteria. actinomycetes and fungi (A. Belay et al.. 2002).

9350,Physiological and Biochemical Responses of Different Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Genotypes under Terminal Heat Stress,2017,Vinai Kumar and Geeta Kandpal and Bhavna Thakur and Dipti Bisarya and Gurdeep Bains,5,IJCS,6,1422-1427,,Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a globally important cereal crop and as a primary source of food. it accounts for 35–75% of the calorie intake of more than 3 billion humans. With the likely growth of world's population toward 10 billion by 2050. the demand for rice will grow faster than for other crops. There are many challenges in achieving higher productivity of rice. In future. the new challenges will include climate change and its consequences. The expected climate change includes the rise in the global average surface air temperature [14]. According to fifth assessment report (AR5) of the intergovernmental panel on climatic change (IPCC) the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 C during the 21st century. This increase in global temperature is the main cause of global warming. which is due to population explosion. the development of industries emitting greenhouse gases and excessive deforestation. It is increasing the world’s average ambient temperature and exacerbating the problem of heat stress. Rising temperatures may lead to altered geographical distribution and growing season of agricultural crops by allowing the threshold temperature for the start of the season and crop maturity to reach earlier [6. 11. 17]. Heat stress is detrimental to many plant species in terms of growth and productivity. especially in the summer months and in warm and temperate climatic regions. Rice is very sensitive to high temperature stress during critical stages of growth. such as flowering and seed development [29] causing a serious reduction in grain yield due to reduced spikelet fertility. decreased grain weight. reduced grain filling. and higher …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:lCwh4MUTK3kC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dipti_Bisarya3/publication/339935871_Physiological_and_Biochemical_Responses_of_Different_Rice_Oryza_sativa_L_Genotypes_under_Terminal_Heat_Stress/links/5e71c89a92851c93e0aa4b7e/Physiological-and-Biochemical-Responses-of-Different-Rice-Oryza-sativa-L-Genotypes-under-Terminal-Heat-Stress.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dipti_Bisarya3/publication/339935871_Physiological_and_Biochemical_Responses_of_Different_Rice_Oryza_sativa_L_Genotypes_under_Terminal_Heat_Stress/links/5e71c89a92851c93e0aa4b7e/Physiological-and-Biochemical-Responses-of-Different-Rice-Oryza-sativa-L-Genotypes-under-Terminal-Heat-Stress.pdf,0

The kinetics of imazethapyr release from the developed formulations was studied in water and it revealed that the developed formulations of imazethapyr behaved as slow release formulations as compared to commercial formulation. The calculated diffusion exponent (n) values showed that Fickian diffusion was the predominant mechanism of imazethapyr release from the developed formulations. Time for release of half of the loaded imazethapyr (t ₁/₂) ranged between 0.06 and 4.8 days in case of GG-NHG and 4.4 and 12.6 days for the GG-HG formulations. Weed control index (WCI) of GG-HG and GG-NHG formulations was similar to that of the commercial formulation and the herbicidal effect was observed for relatively longer period. Guar gum-based biopolymeric hydrogels in both macro and nano particle size range can serve as potential carriers in developing slow release herbicide formulations.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:AC0jL3CeADUC,0,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5693379,,,,,0

After years of economic liberalization. one finds many firms; local. national. and international jostling for consumer attention by producing various types of footwear in Indian market. In fact. today Indian footwear industry is the second largest in the world. This market can be described as a stylized case of a monopolistically competitive market where there is intense competition among firms manufacturing differentiated products. In this study. we focus our attention on men’s formal shoes which are distinguished by the presence (or absence) of many differentiated attributes such as heel. toes. colour. surface. laces. buckles and brands. Invoking hedonic price analysis and bid and offer curves of the customers and firms respectively. shoe prices are viewed as the sum total of the valuation of each of the shoe attributes. We estimate the relative valuation of the shoe attributes by regressing market prices of shoes on various quality attributes. Analysis shows that shoes made of leather. shiny surface. buckles. laces. and brands carry a premium and differentiation based on colour. pointed toes. high heels. and texture is not important. In a highly competitive market. such data driven studies can provide pointers to firms in altering existing shoe models and successfully launching newer ones.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:NIomlIAlHwcC,0,https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2016/retrieve.php?pdfid=513,,,,https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2016/retrieve.php?pdfid=513,0

9362,Computational Analysis on Application of Tubercles for the Performance Improvement of Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine,2017,Eldhose Thomas and Vivek V Kumar and VD Dinuraj and Nithin S Lal and Dilip A Shah,,,,,,In this paper. we aim to delay the onset of stall phenomenon of the blades by applying leading edge modifications to the turbine blade. In nature. the control over the phenomenon of stall is observed in case of Humpback Whales. For these marine creatures. their flippers are having certain projections called tubercles which help it delay flow separation while performing tight underwater maneuvers while preying. These tubercles acts like a passive vortex generator at the tip of blade [2]. So we selected an optimum design from literatures to study their effects when applied to wind turbine blade airfoils. A widely used wind turbine airfoil developed by Delft University in Netherlands was chosen for this project. CFD analysis was used to evaluate and compare the aerodynamic characteristics like lift and drag coefficients of the tubercle modified and the baseline airfoil. The aerodynamic characteristics were analyzed at various angles of attack (AOA) of the airfoil and the study was mainly focused at the performance on the stall angles of the airfoil. After the numerical analysis of the tubercle modified wind turbine airfoil. it was found that the coefficient of lift was increased and coefficient of drag was reduced in the stalling angles effectively delaying the stall. Also it was observed that the tubercle modification does not have any detrimental effects on the aerodynamic performance in the pre-stall regions.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:23IbrMdp7nQC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16478779089264108058&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

For instance. the world’s first grain legume hybrid of pigeonpea ICPH 2671 showed 47% yield advantage over the check varieties. Generally. the development of such hybrids is based on selection efficiency of breeding program; breeders make thousands of random crosses between cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines and tester lines. In order to enhance the selection efficiency. genomic diversity along with the phenotyping data have been used for predicting the best possible parental combinations. This approach has been successfully used in defining heterotic pools in many crop species such as maize. rice. sunflower. and rapeseeds..

The main chemical constituents of BOF slag are CaO. FeO. Al2O3. SiO2 and MgO. Due to its high metallic value (FeO: 16-20%) and lime content (CaO: 45-50%). it is possible to use in iron making and steelmaking process to replace lime and recover iron and CaO. But it also contains some P2O5 around 2–3% which is too high for recycling. The objective of this study is to investigate the removal of phosphorus by magnetic separation technique. The slag generally contains a Ca19Fe2 (PO4) 14 (phosphorus enriched phase) with FeO-CaO-SiO2 matrix phase. X-ray fluorescence (XRF). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis were carried out for characterizing different property of BOF slag. The slag was then crushed and heated at several rates and dwell time up to 1500 C. Afterward it was cooled to 1400 C at the rate of 1 C/min with holding period of 240 min and then quenched with water. The cooled slag was then crushed. milled and separated by wet magnetic separation method.

9373,Development of Proliferation and Acclimatization of Melia dubia-Australian Teak Variety through Micropropagation,2017,VG Saravana Kumar and R Aishwarya,6,Development,1,,,Melia dubia is the Australian Teak wood variety or Forest neem. This study is aimed at the Standardization of Invitro propagation for the proliferation of Melia dubia for the production of saplings trailed with various explants. Bud break of Melia dubia was followed by multiplication. elongation. differentiation. shooting; Rooting and Hardening that resulted in the production of tissue culture Melia dubia plant. The initiated leaves explants were carried over to differentiation stage for the formation of shoots and the recorded response was about 84%. The multiplied plants were transferred to elongation phase for the nodal explants and the best response of the elongated shoot was found to be 88% unlike leaves explants whose elongation response was 82% followed by the Rooting stage which is important for the growth of any plant. It was observed that the activated charcoal addition to the media helped in the higher percentage in root induction of about 90% than 2. 4-D of about 85% almost both in the leaves and nodes as explants. Hardening was the final trial done after Invitro technique which was observed for the acclimatization efficiency where the rooted plants were successfully acclimatized using the combination of several media trials and the recorded mortality was observed to be 3%. This proved the possibility of the production of Melia dubia as multipurpose plant through Micropropagation for the replacement of timber varieties and also for its valuable therapeutic properties.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:nmnCZhbNdt4C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3098152873481519604&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

Typically classification of gender is based on considering pitch as feature. The pitch value of male is lower than the female. In most of the topical research works the process of the classification of gender is performed using the aforementioned condition. In some cases the pitch value of female is lower and also pitch of some male is high. in that case the exact required result is not being produced by this classification method. By considering the aforesaid problem we have here suggested a new method for gender classification which considers three features.

The crude extract showed significant tyrosinase inhibition with IC50 of 17.96 μg/ml. This is the first report of the isolation of these 5 compounds from Greyia radlkoferi. 2′.4′.6′-Trihydroxydihydrochalcone showed the highest tyrosinase inhibition at 17.70 μg/ml (68.48 μM). with low toxicity when compared with crude extract. This compound is therefore. a key component in the crude extract. which is responsible for tyrosinase inhibitory activity. The RT-qPCR indicated that the mechanism of action is most likely post transcriptional. Further. the molecular docking study showed that tyrosinase inhibitory activity depends on interaction of the compound with Cu2+ ions at the active site. This is the first report of the tyrosinase inhibitory activity of the G. radlkoferi extract and molecular insights on interaction of its compounds with Cu2+ ions as the driving factor for tyrosinase inhibition.

As corollary of this fact. the farmer’s attitude towards zero tillage technology largely determines the nature and extent of acceptance of scientific farm technology in modernizing agriculture. Thus. attitude of farmers forms essential components for better implementation and success of improved farm technology. It is therefore crucial to identify the attitude of farmers towards zero tillage to take up such step which are required to make ZTT a success.

About 50% of ES arise in the femur and pelvis. We present a case of ES of the scapula in a seven year old female child. Because of its similarity with other small cell tumors. the diagnosis of ES is challenging and requires a combination of methods like CT scan. MRI report. histopathological evaluation and IHC. etc. The MRI report of our case has shown a consistent 5× 4 cm3 mass on the left scapula. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy of the tumor has been further analyzed. Small. round and oval cells with densely packed nuclei and scanty cytoplasm. which are characteristic to ES were observed microscopically. A positive reaction to vimentin and CD99 and negative result for the biomarkers meant for other types of tumors. favours the diagnosis of ES. The chromosomes analyzed from the peripheral blood of the patient have shown a normal karyotype. Early diagnosis of ES is very crucial for treatment.

Women's liberation movements look down upon motherhood as degrading and a trap to keep women barefoot and pregnant. The children. who do not get mother's care. probably do not become good citizens. This ultimately would damage the whole fabric of society. Therefore mother plays most important role in the construction of society. To be a mother is a holy privilege. Children are a gift from God.

9407,BIFURCATION ANALYSIS OF HYDRODYNAMIC PLAIN JOURNAL BEARING LUBRICATED WITH COUPLE STRESS FLUID,2016,Sanjeev Kumar Lambha and Rajiv Verma and Vinod Kumar,3,Development,3,,,The dynamic analysis of rotor bearing system supported by two couple stress fluid film journal bearings with non-linear suspension is studied in this paper. The hydrodynamic pressure is generated entirely by the motion of the journal and depends on the viscosity of the lubricated fluid. In this analysis the dynamic trajectory. the power spectra. the Poincare maps. and the bifurcation diagrams are used to analyse the behaviour of the rotor centre and bearing centre in horizontal and vertical directions under different operating conditions. The short journal bearing assumptions are used for the analysis. The model consists of non-linear rotor equations of motion. which are system of nonlinear differential equations. The generalized Reynold’s equation is derived for the selected system of rotor bearing. A non dimensional parameter ‘l’has been used for couple stress fluid. The method used to solve the dynamic equations is Range Kutta by considering the effects of rotor speed and degree of rotor unbalance. The periodic. quasi-periodic. subharmonic and chaotic motion are demonstrated in this study. Results show that the dynamics of system depends on rotor speed and degree of rotor unbalance. By using the couple stress fluid as lubricant dynamic stability of rotor bearing system enhances considerably as compared to the system using Newtonian fluid as lubricant.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:lpW5SGgfC70C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9002728369178972384&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

9428,On Estimating the Urban Populations Using Minimum Information,2016,Arun Kumar Sinha and Vijay Kumar and Ravi BP Verma,,,,239-251,,For implementing the programs and policies of the urban planning department we need to know the current populations of the urban areas of interest. Many times the required information is not easily available. In view of these scenarios the paper deals with the estimation of population totals based on ranked set sampling (RSS). which is relatively a new sampling method that utilizes only ranking information about the randomly selected sampling units with respect to the characteristic of interest without using their exact measurements. The estimator is more efficient than that of a simple random sample with the same size. Two illustrations based on reported data sets are given. The findings are expected to be of much help to the policy and decision makers. and also to those who look for a cost-effective sampling method to estimate the urban populations.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:IW6UN8mAVy8C,0,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814704830_0022,,,,,0

Protein domains represent the basic evolutionary units that form proteins. Domain duplication and shuffling by recombination are probably the most important forces driving protein evolution and hence the complexity of the proteome. While the duplication of whole genes as well as domain encoding exons increases the abundance of domains in the proteome. domain shuffling increases versatility. ie the number of distinct contexts in which a domain can occur. In this study we considered five important adapter domain families namely WD40. KELCH. Ankyrin. PDZ and Pleckstrin Homology (PH domain) family for the comparison of Domain versatility.

Thus understanding these characteristics is very important for the design and scaleup of fluidized beds. An earlier developed Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model for simulating dense gas–solid two-phase flow has been used to compare the experimental data in a pseudo-two-dimensional (2-D) bed. Bubbles are injected asymmetrically by locating the nozzle at proximity to the wall. thus presenting the effect wall has on asymmetrical injection as compared to symmetrical injection. In this work. a digital image analysis technique was developed to study the bubble behaviour in a two-dimensional bubbling bed.The high-speed photography reveals an asymmetric wake formation during detachment indicating an early onset of mixing process. The wall forces acts tangentially on the bubble and has a significant impact on the bubble shape. neck formation during detachment and its trajectory through the bed. Larger bubbles drifting away from the centre with longer paths are observed. This qualitative behaviour is well predicted by CFD modelling. Asymmetric injection can significantly influence the heat and mass transfer characteristics.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:pXQX5lkvYSAC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vishwanath_Panangipalli/publication/287508697_QUALITATIVE_ASSESSMENT_OF_BUBBLE_BEHAVIOUR_FOR_CENTRAL_AND_ASYMMETRIC_INJECTION_IN_2D_GAS-SOLID_FLUIDIZED_BED_USING_IMAGE_ANALYSIS_TECHINIQUE_AND_CFD_MODELLING/links/567762a608ae0ad265c5b812/QUALITATIVE-ASSESSMENT-OF-BUBBLE-BEHAVIOUR-FOR-CENTRAL-AND-ASYMMETRIC-INJECTION-IN-2D-GAS-SOLID-FLUIDIZED-BED-USING-IMAGE-ANALYSIS-TECHINIQUE-AND-CFD-MODELLING.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vishwanath_Panangipalli/publication/287508697_QUALITATIVE_ASSESSMENT_OF_BUBBLE_BEHAVIOUR_FOR_CENTRAL_AND_ASYMMETRIC_INJECTION_IN_2D_GAS-SOLID_FLUIDIZED_BED_USING_IMAGE_ANALYSIS_TECHINIQUE_AND_CFD_MODELLING/links/567762a608ae0ad265c5b812/QUALITATIVE-ASSESSMENT-OF-BUBBLE-BEHAVIOUR-FOR-CENTRAL-AND-ASYMMETRIC-INJECTION-IN-2D-GAS-SOLID-FLUIDIZED-BED-USING-IMAGE-ANALYSIS-TECHINIQUE-AND-CFD-MODELLING.pdf,0

9448,Magnetic Properties of Nanoparticle Matrix Composites,2015,Vijay Kumar,,,,,VIJAY KUMAR FOUNDATION CHENNAI (INDIA),The aim of the project was to develop strong permanent magnets using nanoparticles and their composites. For this an understanding of the magnetic properties of nanoparticles was also needed. Assemblies of nanoparticles can be used to develop novel exchange coupled strong magnets without using rare earths as well as for high density magnetic recording media. Some of these nanoparticles (such as Fe-Pt) can also be very interesting for catalysis. Fe-Pt is one of the most promising materials due to its large magnetic anisotropy. Ab initio calculations on Fe-Pt nanoalloys (clusters and nanoparticles) were performed to understand the atomic and electronic structure. and the magnetic behavior. The findings revealed a tendency for Pt segregation on the surface and a preference for maximizing Fe-Pt bonds. The formation energy of the nanoalloys is the highest around 50: 50 composition as also in bulk Fe-Pt. but Pt tends to occupy low coordination sites. An icosahedral Fe72Pt75 (close to 50: 50 composition) nanoparticle having 147 atoms (1.5 nm diameter) was investigated and found to phase separate into a Fe55 core and (Fe-Pt) 92 ordered shell. These results show that such nanoparticles prefer decahedral or icosahedral structure and a transition to bulk structure should occur at significantly higher sizes. which agrees with experiments that show a transition to bulk structure in FePt nanoparticles for sizes larger than 2.5 nm. Further ab initio calculations were done for the first time on Fe3Pt type nanoparticles (soft magnetic material) embedded in FePt matrix (hard magnet) to model composites.

9454,Relevance of Workplace Spirituality in the Indian Insurance Sector,2015,Manu Gupta and Mandeep Singh and Vinod Kumar,76,Social Sciences,2,,,The work demands in today’s competitive workplace cause stress. anxiety. fear. and depression among employees. Workplace spirituality enables individuals to overcome the major psycho-social issues arising from this situation. Awareness of workplace spirituality has increased gradually in the last decade of the twentieth century (Jurkiewicz and Giacalone. 2004). and today. employees desire to live by their faith and spiritual values in the workplace. Spirituality imparts a sense of purpose in life. for example. a doctor’s sense of purpose might come from his or her having the ability to save lives. Bregman and Thierman (1995) defined spirituality as “how the individual lives meaningfully with ultimacy in his or her response to the deepest truths of the universe”(p. 149). Mitroff and Denton (1999) define spirituality as “the basic feeling of being connected with one’s complete self. others. and the entire universe”(p. 83).,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:-aZU7N-im6MC,0,http://ijsw.tiss.edu/greenstone/collect/ijsw/archives/HASHae26/f93a04d8.dir/doc.pdf,,,,http://ijsw.tiss.edu/greenstone/collect/ijsw/archives/HASHae26/f93a04d8.dir/doc.pdf,0

9469,Effect of chill condition and grain refinement on the microstructure and mechanical properties of B319 aluminum alloy,2015,Vishank Kumar,,,,,,Description The demand for lightweight vehicles continues to stimulate extensive research into the development of lightweight aluminum alloys for automotive castings and associated optimization of the processing parameters. However. the mechanical properties (hardness. tensile strength and thermal fatigue resistance) of many alloys still remain low for many applications in the automotive engine market. In order to improve the mechanical properties. a fine grain size of the as-cast alloy is preferred. which can be most commonly achieved in the foundry industry by: a) Higher cooling rate; or b) Addition of grain refiners. To provide higher cooling rates. chill is often placed in the casting cavity to act as a heat sink and consequently increase the local solidification rate. More aggressive cooling can be achieved by running water through the chill. However. high thermal gradients may develop residual strain in the as-cast alloy. which may be detrimental to the life-cycle of the automotive part and thus needs to be evaluated. The results of this thesis suggest that water cooled chill provides higher thermal gradient. resulting in a finer grain size and improved hardness with lower residual strain and texture as compared to no water cooled chill cast samples. Delaying water flow in the chill after 10 seconds introduces anisotropy in a casting by developing a fibre texture as compared to the samples prepared with continuously water cooled chill. Grain refinement is a well established foundry practice to inoculate the melt by the addition of grain refiner. which acts as heterogeneous nucleation site for solidifying α-Al to form a fine grained microstructure.

9479,Studies to Improve Wheat for High Temperature Stress Areas,2015,Suman Bakshi and Vikash Kumar and Abhijit Shitre and Bikram Kishore Das,3,American Journal of BioScience,3,64-69,,Heat stress is one of major limitations in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) productivity in arid. semiarid. tropical and semi tropical regions of world. Wheat is grown as winter cereal crop in subtropical countries like India. The crop experiences chronic high temperature at most of phenological stages of growth. A detailed understanding of genetic variation and mechanisms of heat tolerance in wheat would facilitate development of intrinsically thermotolerant genotypes. To understand thermotolerance of currently grown wheat varieties. studies on physiological assays at seedling stage. canopy temperature depression (CTD). dry matter translocation (DMT) were carried out along with estimation of field performance. Seedling screening assays identified varieties showing thermotolerance at seedling stage and showed association with high temperature tolerance at adult plant stage. Advanced generation selections were developed from the crosses involving these genotypes. which showed yield advantage over standard check in rod row trials at three different locations. The thousand-kernel weight for these selections ranged from 47.7 to 50.1 g with average increase of 13% over the parental mean at Pune location. Studies on an alternative dwarfing gene Rht8. known to reduce plant height by 10 percent without significant reduction in yield under high temperature was also undertaken. Genotypic and phenotypic analysis of 92 genotypes confirmed the absence of Rht8 gene in the cultivated varieties of India. Rht8 gene was transferred to tall genotypes viz.

9482,Study the Effect of Sensitization on the Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of AISI 304 SS Joints using GTAW Process,2015,Viranshu Kumar and Hitesh Arora,,,,,,SS 304 is Austenitic stainless steel (ASS) with Nickel and Chromium as basic constituents. It has very good weldability and corrosion resistance. Austenitic stainless steels form chromium depleted zones at the grain boundaries during heat treatment and welding. where carbon combines with chromium and form chromium carbide at the grain boundaries. This phenomenon is known as sensitization. The objective of this dissertation is to study the effect of sensitization on the microstructure and mechanical properties such as microhardness. impact strength. yield strength and tensile strength of an austenitic stainless steel. Samples of the steel have been given sensitization treatment by holding at 750 O C to 1000O C temperature for different soaking time periods ranging from 0.5 to 2 hours followed by normalizing. The microstructures of sensitized samples have been observed by optical microscope. The mechanical testing such as micro hardness. impact test. and tensile testing of each specimen has been performed. The micro hardness. impact strength and tensile strength of the investigated stainless steel sharply decreases with increase in sensitization time. whereas the yield strength of this steel changes marginally with sensitization time.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:_obbd28Je0oC,0,http://dspace.lpu.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/3549/1/11000030_4_30_2015%206_00_36%20AM_report%20final.pdf,,,,http://dspace.lpu.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/3549/1/11000030_4_30_2015%206_00_36%20AM_report%20final.pdf,0

9484,Preliminary optical and thermal design of a 600 kWh direct absorption molten salt receiver/storage system 2,2015,Benjamin Grange and Vikas Kumar and Antoni Gil and Miguel Diago and Peter R Armstrong and Alexander Slocum and Nicolas Calvet,,,,,,A concentrated solar power beam-down tower focuses its energy directly into a single-tank molten salt volumetric receiver that also 11 acts as a thermal energy storage unit. The system is being developed in connection with the CSPonD Demo (Concentrated Solar 12 Power on Demand Demonstration) at the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology in partnership with MIT.. The relatively small 13 angle subtended by rays emanating from the central reflector of a beam down optical system. together with the nature of solar energy 14 absorption within the volumetric receiver. make use of a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) or CPC-like final optical element 15 (FOE) attractive. An effective concentration of about 4-5 can be achieved to increase solar flux at the tank aperture from 150 to 600 16 suns. This paper describes preliminary designs of the CPC and tank/receiver. Optical simulations reveal that. for a given solar incident 17 power at the tank aperture. a conical final concentrator design produces a more uniform flux distribution with better axial alignment 18 (lower average horizontal component) of rays at its outlet. compared to a conventional CPC of revolution. However. the cone may 19 require a larger outlet radius. leading to higher thermal losses through the tank aperture. With the current design of the tank. the losses 20 through the walls. as well as the convective losses through the aperture during day time. correspond to 4.5% of the thermal capacity. 21 22,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:vytXtR8tOLIC,0,http://web.mit.edu/parmstr/www/pubs/AppliedEnergy-Revised-BGrange-v4.pdf,,,,http://web.mit.edu/parmstr/www/pubs/AppliedEnergy-Revised-BGrange-v4.pdf,0

The quantification processes consist of the measurements of entities which need to be analyzed during the software development processes. In software engineering. these entities are called software metrics. which are measured in all the phases of software development life cycle. There are defined processes and product metrics which contain various attributes to be measured. Direct measurement is not possible for some software metrics; hence these metrics are derived using a combination of different metrics attributes. For example. size metric is a direct measure and complexity is indirect measure. which depends on a combination of different factors. Software metrics measurement has been a great research interest area for last four decades. The different conventional statistical methods have been proposed for analysis and measurements of the software attributes. Regression analysis is frequently used method for software attributes analysis. Although conventional methodologies are most widely used in the industries worldwide but recently the research communities are moving towards interdisciplinary streams and have started exploring the unconventional techniques such as fuzzy logic. artificial neural network. neuro-fuzzy etc. There are some metrics attributes. which needs forecasting ie. the occurrence in future for better process improvement in advance.

9512,Interaction of neutrinos with matter in low and intermediate energy region,2014,K Saraswat and V Kumar and P Shukla and V Singh,59,Proceedings of the DAE Symp. on Nucl. Phys,,798,,There are compelling evidences for oscillations of neutrinos which are caused by nonzero neutrino masses and neutrino mixing [1]. The 3-neutrino mixing in vacuum can be parameterized in terms of three mixing angles θ12. θ23. θ13 and a CP phase δ. Thus. the neutrino oscillations are determined in terms of these parameters as well as two mass squared differences∆ m221 and∆ m2 32. The neutrinos generated in the upper atmosphere are the best candidates to study the phenomena of neutrino oscillations considered by many experiments planned worldwide. The flux of atomospheric neutrinos [2] rapidly falls with energy as shown in Figure 1 at the INO site. Typically. the detectors measure recoil muons which are produced by charged current interaction of neutrinos inside the detector medium. Considering the acceptances of the detectors (eg ICAL at INO) neutrinos between energy 1 to 3 GeV will form bulk of the signal. The interaction of neutrinos with matter at this energy involves many processes. We study the contributions of these processes for free nucleon as well as nuclei.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:CLq-vN-5V-oC,0,http://www.sympnp.org/proceedings/59/F8.pdf,,,,http://www.sympnp.org/proceedings/59/F8.pdf,0

9514,Toxoplasma gondii Is Dependent on Glutamine and Alters Migratory Profile of Infected Host,2014,IP Lee and AK Evans and C Yang and MG Works and V Kumar,,,,,,The obligate intracellular parasite. Toxoplasma gondii. disseminates through its host inside infected immune cells. We hypothesize that parasite nutrient requirements lead to manipulation of migratory properties of the immune cell. We demonstrate that 1) T. gondii relies on glutamine for optimal infection. replication and viability. and 2) T. gondii-infected bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) display both ‘‘hypermotility’’and ‘‘enhanced migration’’to an elevated glutamine gradient in vitro. We show that glutamine uptake by the sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT2) is required for this enhanced migration. SNAT2 transport of glutamine is also a significant factor in the induction of migration by the small cytokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in uninfected DCs. Blocking both SNAT2 and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4; the unique receptor for SDF-1) blocks hypermotility and the enhanced migration in T. gondii-infected DCs. Changes in host cell protein expression following T. gondii infection may explain the altered migratory phenotype; we observed an increase of CD80 and unchanged protein level of CXCR4 in both T. gondii-infected and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated DCs. However. unlike activated DCs. SNAT2 expression in the cytosol of infected cells was also unchanged.

The extinction model studied in this analysis is motivated by the search for signatures of strong gravity at the TeV scale (terascale gravity) and assumes the existence of string couplings in the strong-coupling limit. In this limit. the string model predicts the suppression of all high-transverse-momentum standard model processes. including jet production. beyond a certain energy scale. To test this prediction. the measured transverse-momentum spectrum is compared to the theoretical prediction of the standard model. No significant deficit of events is found at high transverse momentum.

The framework comprises three levels of modelling. ranging in scope from the dynamics of individual model entities to system-level emergent properties. By way of an immunological case study of the mouse disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. we show how the framework can be used to produce models that capture and communicate the biological system. detailing how biological entities. interactions and behaviours lead to higher-level emergent properties observed in the real world. We demonstrate how the UML can be successfully applied within our framework. and provide a critique of UML’s ability to capture concepts fundamental to immunology and biology more generally. We show how specialized. well-explained diagrams with less formal semantics can be used where no suitable UML formalism exists. We highlight UML’s lack of expressive ability concerning cyclic feedbacks in cellular networks. and the compounding concurrency arising from huge numbers of stochastic. interacting agents. To compensate for this. we propose several additional relationships for expressing these concepts in UML’s activity diagram. We also demonstrate the ambiguous nature of class diagrams when applied to complex biology. and question their utility in modelling such dynamic systems. Models created through our framework are non-executable. and expressly free of simulation implementation concerns. They are a valuable complement and precursor to simulation specifications and implementations …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:GYhD2SfYQcAC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/39933649/Modelling_biological_behaviours_with_the20151112-12865-1rq0yyc.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/39933649/Modelling_biological_behaviours_with_the20151112-12865-1rq0yyc.pdf,0

After years of economic liberalization. one finds many firms; local. national. and international jostling for consumer attention by producing various types of footwear in Indian market. In fact. today Indian footwear industry is the second largest in the world. This market can be described as a stylized case of a monopolistically competitive market where there is intense competition among firms manufacturing differentiated products. In this study. we focus our attention on men’s formal shoes which are distinguished by the presence (or absence) of many differentiated attributes such as heel. toes. colour. surface. laces. buckles and brands. Invoking hedonic price analysis and bid and offer curves of the customers and firms respectively. shoe prices are viewed as the sum total of the valuation of each of the shoe attributes. We estimate the relative valuation of the shoe attributes by regressing market prices of shoes on various quality attributes. Analysis shows that shoes made of leather. shiny surface. buckles. laces. and brands carry a premium and differentiation based on colour. pointed toes. high heels. and texture is not important. In a highly competitive market. such data driven studies can provide pointers to firms in altering existing shoe models and successfully launching newer ones.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:OATjCxfXK_sC,0,http://vslir.iima.ac.in:8080/jspui/handle/11718/17166,,,,http://vslir.iima.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/11718/17166/1/WP_2014_12_04.pdf,0

Conservation agriculture (CA) based resource-conserving technologies ie zero-tillage (ZT). raised-bed planting and direct-seeded rice (DSR) have shown promise as alternatives to conventional production technologies to overcome these problems. Present study was undertaken during 2009–2012 to establish an understanding of how permanent raised bed cropping system could be practiced to save water at the field application level to improve water productivity and also have the capability to enhance productivity. profitability and soil physical quality. The results showed that among different crop establishment techniques. conventional-tilled puddle transplanted rice (CT-TPR) required 14%-25% more water than other techniques. Compared with the CT-TPR system. zero till direct-seeded rice (ZT-DSR) consumed 6%–10% less water with almost equal system productivity and demonstrated higher water productivity. Wide raised beds saved about 15%–24% water and grain yield decrease of about 8%. Direct-seeded rice after ZT or reduced tillage or on unpuddled soil provided more net income than CT-TPR. The CTTPR system had higher bulk density and penetration resistance due to compaction caused by the repeated wet tillage in rice.

9533,Glaucoma Diagnosis by Measuring Spatial Parameters in Ultrasound Bio-Microscopy Images,2014,Varun Prakash R Vinoth Kumar,,,,,,Glaucoma is a chronic eye disease. in which the optic nerve is progressively damaged. It is second leading cause of blindness. Glaucoma cannot be cured. but its progression can be slowed down by treatment. As symptoms only occur when the disease is quite advanced. glaucoma is called silent thief of sight. Therefore. detecting glaucoma in time is critical. Anterior segment assessment of eye can be done by using Ultrasound Bio-Microscopy (UBM) images of eye. It is a high-frequency ultrasound technology that provides exceptionally detailed two-dimensional gray-scale images of anterior segment structures of eye. Initially the UBM image is converted to a binary image. so that traversing different geometric regions would be easy. In this image various approved spatial parameters like Pavlin’s parameter are measured. Clinically. standard threshold levels to differentiate between normal and abnormal patients using these parameters are unavailable. So measurement is done for many patients and from that data the range of values for normal and abnormal cases is identified.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:JLWRInN_eHMC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Varun_Prakash_Rajamohan/publication/283441410_Glaucoma_Diagnosis_by_Measuring_Spatial_Parameters_in_Ultrasound_Bio-Microscopy_Images/links/56385de108ae78d01d39556c/Glaucoma-Diagnosis-by-Measuring-Spatial-Parameters-in-Ultrasound-Bio-Microscopy-Images.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Varun_Prakash_Rajamohan/publication/283441410_Glaucoma_Diagnosis_by_Measuring_Spatial_Parameters_in_Ultrasound_Bio-Microscopy_Images/links/56385de108ae78d01d39556c/Glaucoma-Diagnosis-by-Measuring-Spatial-Parameters-in-Ultrasound-Bio-Microscopy-Images.pdf,0

9539,Intensity and Texture Gradient Based Boundary Detection Algorithm for Medical Image,2013,V Sai Kumar and V Vijaya Kishore,6,International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology,4,219-225,,In today’s technological world images plays a very important role. Images are very helpful in several fields like non-destructive testing. Medical diagnostics. surveillance and military etc. in image analysis and computer vision edge detection and boundary detection plays a very fundamental role. For image interpretation tasks and in image analysis processes the boundary of image will provide valuable information. The main objective behind the boundary detection is to detect the shape or outline of object. Generally Image segmentation is aimed to find the objects and object boundaries in images and it assigns a label in every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same level share have certain virtual characteristics. However finding the exact boundary in images is a very difficult task. In this paper we propose an efficient and robust technique for the detection of boundaries in noisy images. Our proposed method uses the information or data from texture and intensity gradients. The texture information will get using edge map model and intensity gradients will get using the edge vector gradient model. The proposed concept for boundary detection and edge following technique is efficient and as well as robust and it is applicable to several kinds of medical images such as magnetic resonance (MR) images. ultrasound images. and computerized tomography images etc. Finally the results for this proposed method shows that the proposed method performs very well and yields better performance than the classical contour models.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:CPlVwKnI7G4C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14365224612560141936&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0
9540,Numerical Simulation of Pitching and Plunging Motion of Flat Plate Using Overset Meshes,2013,R Gavasane and P Pai and V Kumar,,,,,,A numerical simulation of two and three-dimensional pitching and plunging motions of flat plate at Reynolds number of O (104) is presented. This study is carried out in STAR-CCM+ to investigate the physics of flapping wings. The focus of the study is to probe into the effects of kinematics. Reynolds number and three dimensionality with resulting aerodynamic forces and flow structures on the flat plate. A shallow stall and a deep stall motion of a nominally two dimensional flat plate with higher effective angles of attack is considered. Also. in order to examine the three dimensional effects on force coefficients. an aspect ratio 2 flat plate is studied and is compared to its two dimensional counterpart. The results obtained are then validated against the experimental study available in literature. It is observed that due to more aggressive effective angle of attack time history in case of deep stall motion. a stronger LEV and higher lift is achieved as compared to that of shallow stall motion. Also. Reynolds number is seen to have a negligible effect on the aerodynamic structures and forces in the range 10.000 to 60.000. In the investigation of three-dimensionality effects. it is observed that presence of Tip Vortex mitigates the lift produced on 3D flat plate as compared to 2D flat plate. The numerical simulations performed in STAR CCM+ agree well with the experimental results obtained from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV).,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:_Ib3u7pdcXQC,0,http://www.academia.edu/download/31976968/SAROD2013_R_Gavasane_IITGn.pdf,,,,http://www.academia.edu/download/31976968/SAROD2013_R_Gavasane_IITGn.pdf,0

It is also most wide-spread zoonotic infection. in the developed and developing world. transmissible from animals to humans. It is an important neglected zoonotic problem in India accounting for a loss of about 30 million man days per year (Handa et al.. 1998). Asia is currently considered as one of the high prevalence regions of this disease.India is an agricultural country and exposure of humans to animals is quite high. Dairy farm workers are constantly exposed to infection due to contamination of hands and arms while milking the animals. The dairy farm workers also spend a considerable amount of time attending to the animals need and attending to them in parturition and often sleeping alongside them. In India. as per ADMAS (Animal Disease Monitoring and Surveillance. Bangalore) report on long term survey of bovine brucellosis (1994-2002) the disease is widespread in most parts. with cumulative average of 6.8% in bovine. The overall national average incidence of brucellosis in cattle and buffalo was 7.2% and 5.25% respectively.

In this paper. we focus on screw theory and its relationship to second and higher order kinematic properties. We start with the geometry of the Lie group SE (3). the special Euclidean group in three dimensions. It is well known that the set of all twists can be identified with the tangent vectors at the identity element to form a Lie algebra. We argue that in order to describe second order kinematic properties. it is necessary to endow SE (3) with an affine connection. The connection allows us to differentiate twists to obtain higher order derivatives. To get correct expressions for the rigid body acceleration and jerk. it is necessary to use a suitable affine connection. We show that there is a unique symmetric connection with this property. We also prove that there is a unique invariant. symmetric connection that leads to the definition of the acceleration screw.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:SDwcUXvf3vAC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=4wLuCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA365&dq=info:4oOLusImzGQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=GDTZ-P8keK&sig=5XquBMFVLKLBQs6gxUQF-RZVYOo,,,,,0

9563,Analysis of regenerative beam break up instability in linear accelerators,2013,V Kumar and AR Jana and NS Kulkarni and R Dhingra,,,,,,[en] In a linear accelerator. when we increase the beam current. a threshold is reached beyond which the beam becomes unstable. This limits the beam power that can be obtained using a particular linac. This phenomenon was first observed during the development of linacs in late 1950s and was later identified as regenerative beam break up instability. Calculation of the threshold current for this instability constitutes an important part in the design of high average power linacs. Formula for calculating the threshold current exists in literature. but there are several aspects regarding the derivation of the formula. which are often not described in the existing literature with sufficient clarity. In this paper. we present a detailed analysis of this instability and emphasize different approximations used in the derivation.

Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against the test bacteria for polyquats is presented. It is clear that the antibacterial efficiency and efficacy of polyquats grafted cotton does not solely depend on presence of quaternary ammonium group but also on the associated alkyl chain attached to quaternary group. PMAETC-g-cotton having only aliphatic chains was found to be less efficient and effective than PVBT-g-cotton having aromatic ring. Despite comparatively low MBC values of PAETC. PAETC-g-cotton was less efficient than the PMAETC or PVBT grafted samples. It may be due to lower grafting yield of PAETC as maximum grafting achieved for the PAETC was 10% but in case of PMAETC and PVBT it was∼ 25%. From this study it can be concluded that efficacy and efficiency of grafted cotton fibrils followed the order PVBT> PMAETC> PAETC against the Bacteria E. coli and S. aureus,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:jP_f45FvDEgC,0,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:45011765,,,,,0

India,Energy crisis. special economic zones. global warming and increasing cost of agricultural inputs are the main problems that the farmers have been facing today. These problems create many other problems. Further. there has been an indiscriminate. imbalanced and excessive use of resources during the last four decades. for cultivation of crops. Consequently. the quality and quantity of our resources are adversely affected and several problems are arising in crop production. i.e. decreasing yield of crops. reducing the quality of farm produce. deficiency of plant nutrient in soil. decrease in ground water level. presence of toxic substances in soil. water. air and shortage of nutritious farm products etc. In addition to above. increasing cost of cultivation and lesser returns in agriculture is the matter of concern. Keeping in view the above problems in crop production. there is a great need of resource conservation techniques for sustainable crop production by maintaining the quality of our resources so that we can fulfill the requirement of present generation and provide better environment for future generations also. During the last one and half decade several conservation techniques like zero tillage. sowing on raising beds. crop diversification. laser levelling and SRI technique of rice growing developed. These techniques not only improve the crop production but also increase the quality of our resources.

Hyderabad,Collar rot caused by the Aspergillus niger and stem rot caused by Sclerotium rolfsii are major threats to groundnut production worldwide. To identify genotypes with desired levels of resistance. screening of a large number of germplasm under artificial epiphytotic conditions (sick plots) is essential. The inoculums of virulent isolates were mass multiplied and mixed with FYM and applied separately to each of the micro plots of sick plot at Directorate of Groundnut Research. Junagadh. India. The growth and multiplication of A. niger and S. rolfsii in the soil was monitored periodically at monthly intervals during kharif 2011. The study revealed that the soil population of A. niger had steadily increased from 1.8 to 23.4 X 103 cfu during June to October in spite of the heavy rainfall (1613 mm in 66 rainy days). While it was converse in case of Sclerotium rolfsii where the soil population decreased drastically (24.4 x 103 cfu) from the initial level (30.2 x 103 cfu) and subsequently got increased in the months of September (21.6 x 103 cfu) and October (24.4 x 103 cfu) when the rainfall decreased (312 mm in 14 rainy days and 55 mm in 2 rainy days in September and October month respectively). Thus the study clearly indicated that the population built up of A. niger was unaffected due to heavy rainfall and once the rain ceases and optimal conditions restored. there will be a sudden spurt in the incidence of the collar rot disease. While in case of stem rot. the incidence of the disease will be low following a heavy rainfall. Thus. chemical control is possible for stem rot while genetic resistance is the suitable option in case of collar rot.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:z2pFVVSJm18C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7887768207999067109&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

I read with interest the paper by Chen et al.. which showed that therapy with tacrolimus is as effective as azathioprine as maintenance immunosuppression in patients with lupus nephritis. 1 Tacrolimus would be a good maintenance immunosuppression in lupus nephritis patients with bone marrow suppression due to azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Patients with intermediate or deficient TPMT (thiopurine methyltransferase) activity exposed to azathioprine show severe hematopoietic toxicity. 2 At a certain stage it might as well become difficult to differentiate between drug-induced bone marrow suppression and relapse of lupus. especially in the absence of relevant activity markers. The study by Chen et al. has highlighted the low total white blood cell (WBC) count and neutrophil count in the azathioprine group compared with the tacrolimus arm (p< 0.05). 1 However. there are certain concerns about using the tacrolimus as maintenance immunosuppression in lupus nephritis. In a review by Ortega et al. published in this journal. the authors investigated an extended period of maintenance immunosuppression for an undefined length in lupus patients at high risk of relapse. High risk included lupus patients with male sex.

We have investigated the effect of irradiation parameters such as energy and ions fluence on optical. structural and chemical properties of the studied polymer. respectively. UV-Visible. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectral studies have been employed in the present investigation. UV-Visible spectra exhibit a shift towards the higher wavelength regime after irradiation. This shift clearly reflects decrease in optical band gap after irradiation. The FTIR spectrum shows a decrease in intensity of the typical bands whereas the formation of new bands indicates the degradation of the polymer after irradiation. The XRD pattern of M-KG PC shows the decreasing intensity of peak positions with increase in ions fluence. which suggests loss of crystallinity of the films due to irradiation. Observed results indicate the formation of disordered system in the irradiated films. Magnitude of effect of irradiation is greater in case of 150 MeV Ni {sup 11+} rather than 100 MeV O {sup 7+} ions due to high electronic energy loss of Ni {sup 11+} ions in,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:TTos0WgDdeoC,0,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/22085826,,,,,0

CA (United States),The dilepton invariant mass spectrum measured in heavy-ion collisions includes contributions from important QGP probes such as thermal radiation and the quarkonium (J/ψ. ψ′ and Υ) states. Dileptons coming from hard qq scattering. the Drell-Yan process. contribute in all mass regions. In heavy-ion colliders. such as the LHC. semileptonic decays of heavy flavor hadrons provide a substantial contribution to the dilepton continuum. In the present study. we calculate cc and bb production and determine their contributions to the dilepton continuum in Pb+ Pb collisions at√ sNN= 2.76 TeV. We also calculate the rates for Drell-Yan and thermal dilepton production. The contributions to the continuum from these dilepton sources are studied in the kinematic ranges relevant for the LHC detectors. The relatively high pT cutoff for single leptons excludes most dileptons produced by the thermal medium. Heavy flavors are the dominant source of dilepton production in all the kinematic regimes. particularly at forward rapidities. due to the broad rapidity distribution of these decay dileptons.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:E6fllpwcL2QC,0,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1093407,,,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1093407,0

Surgical treatment of proximal fibula osteochondromas may vary from debulking to resection of proximal fibula. We describe a modified surgical technique for excision of proximal fibular osteochondromas. which preserves the Proximal Tibio-Fibular Joint. We present a series of six cases of symptomatic proximal fibular osteochondroma. Four cases were solitary osteochondromas while two were a manifestation of a hereditary multiple exostoses. Indication for surgery was peroneal nerve symptoms in three. cosmesis in one. restricted knee motion in one. and pain in one case. All these cases were operated by a modified resection technique where the head of fibula was preserved The proximal tibio-fibular joint was preserved.

A WSN Consists of ten to thousand of sensor nodes that communicate through wireless channels for information sharing and cooperative processing. We attach the sensor nodes to specific items to be monitored. covering an area with locomotive sensor nodes. The sensor node is also known as mote. In WSN all the sensor nodes send the data to a sink node. We consider the sink node as base station node. which is more powerful in comparison to other nodes in case of data processing. storage etc. Queries are also submitted at the base station. In this our main focus is on base station queries optimization. When a new query is submitted to the base station. we check whether the new query can be evaluated using the result of currently running queries. If it is possible then we rewrites a new query using currently running queries at the base station without injecting it into the sensor network.

Seventeen CIP-bred clones and locally cultivated Indian varieties were evaluated for resistance to late blight (LB) under long day conditions in the highlands in 2008 and 2009. The same clones were tested for their yield potential and tuber characteristics in lowlands in 2008-09 and 2009-10 crop seasons under short day conditions. In 2008. all genotypes except five clones and variety Kufri Girdhari were completely devastated by LB. The two-year area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) indicated that CIP clones 395017.229. 395109.29. 396244.12 and variety Kufri Girdhari were resistant to LB. whereas three other clones 394611.112. 395112.6 and 396037.215 were moderately resistant. One of the resistant clones 395109.29 gave high dry matter (21.3%) and yielded at par with Kufri Bahar which is cultivated widely in lowlands. The mean tuber yields of CIP clones 395193.6 and 397065.28 were 43.39 t ha-1 and 36.04 t ha-1. respectively compared to 31.33 t ha-1 of the most popular variety Kufri Bahar.

9656,Mathematical model for calculating ionicity of binary Semiconductors,2010,Jitendra Kumar Singh and V Kumar,5,International Journal of Material Sciences,1,59-65,,The ionicity has been one of the most important parameters of semiconductors. which determines other properties such as band gap. micro hardness. refractive index etc. The band gap energy determines the critical wavelength (λ= 1.24/E g) of semiconductors and hence these semiconductors are used in various linear and non-linear optical devices. In this paper we have developed a simple relation between ionicity and bond length of III-V. II-VI and I-VII semiconductors by simulation method. The proposed relation has been found to be linear in nature. Based on proposed relation. we have calculated ionicity of III-V. II-VI and I-VII semiconductors. The calculated values of ionicity are compared with the experimental and reported values of different workers. A fairly good agreement has been obtained between them. The curves have also been plotted between bond length and ionicity. This relation may be used to determine the values of ionicity for new materials belonging to these groups of semiconductors.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:ioHeyGUL3JsC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jitendra_Singh85/publication/302587459_Mathematical_Model_for_Calculating_Ionicity_of_Binary_Semiconductors/links/5731bbed08ae6cca19a2f32a,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jitendra_Singh85/publication/302587459_Mathematical_Model_for_Calculating_Ionicity_of_Binary_Semiconductors/links/5731bbed08ae6cca19a2f32a,0

The depolarization effect shifts the excitation energy to higher energy side and suppresses intensity of the absorption peaks. As a result excitation energy becomes closer to that associated with that of the second gap for parallel polarization. The intensity of the absorption peaks is weakly dependent on the Coulomb interaction and the tube diameter through the cut off energy.

9670,B-meson measurement via secondary J/{psi} production in Pb-Pb collisions at {radical} s NN= 5.5 TeV,2009,P Shukla and V Kumar and RK Choudhury and S Kailas,,,,,,A Pb+ Pb run at {radical} s NN= 5.5 TeV is expected to take place by the end of year 2010. It is convenient to quote all the numbers for one month (10 {sup 6} s) of LHC running. The luminosity for Pb+ Pb collisions integrated over one month is about 0.5 nb {sup-} 1. Quarks lose energy in the medium by gluon Beamstrahlung which is suppressed at angle smaller than the ratio of their mass with energy. Thus. the heavy quarks are predicted to lose less energy as compared to light quarks but at RHIC it was found that c quarks also lose substantial energy as much as light quarks. The production of charm and bottom at LHC would be at least one order of magnitude larger than those at RHIC enabling more precise systematic studies of the energy loss phenomena of heavy flavours for the first time.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:NVvf8e-c9oUC,0,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21307279,,,,,0

The drive train determines how efficiently the energy in batteries is used to meet the driving requirements on road. The importance of efficiency is well known. With a ‘limited’energy storage availability on board. it is important to see that the conversion of watt hours to kms happens in the most efficient manner. Also. in order to make driving simple and offer the best ‘on road’convenience to customers. it is necessary to understand driving patterns and preferences of customers.

Agriculture contributes approximately 13.5% green house gasses emission at the global level. The maximum area of rice cultivation is in India at global level. In our country rice is being cultivated on an area of 44.0 million hectares (FAI. 2007-08).  Rice is not only a food for more than half of the population of India but it is a base for nutritious food. Rice has an important place among the cereal crops. Rice is being cultivated in almost all the states of India. as a main crop. India is one of the main producers and exporter of aromatic rice in the international market. Presently. farmers are facing serious problems pertaining to shortage of  energy. increase in agricultural input prices and global climate change. These problems automatically create many other problems. Many problems are arising due to faulty irrigation system and indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizer in the cultivation of rice.  Traditional flooding irrigation system and more than required fertilizer uses for the cultivation of rice has become a serious challenge for the environment degradation. Consequently. by the cultivation of rice. the green house gasses emission like methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (NO2) concentrations increase in environment. resulting such ill-effects leading to climate change. The  change in the climate is affecting not only the human beings but also other mammals and living beings health adversely.

9678,Virentrack: A heuristic for reducing cache contention,2009,Viren Kumar,,,,,,Multicore processors are the dominant paradigm in mainstream computing for the present and foreseeable future. Current operating system schedulers on multicore systems coschedule applications on cores at random. This often exacerbates issues such as cache contention. leading to a performance decrease. Optimally scheduling applications to take advantage of multicore characteristics remains a difficult and open problem. In this thesis. I advocate a method of optimized scheduling on multicore systems that takes advantage of the caching attributes of applications. My scheduler is a user-level process that co-schedules applications based on cache metrics obtained from hardware performance counters. This phase-aware scheduler is able to effectively co-schedule two pairs of applications. extracting up to a 100% of all possible improvement in some workloads. Additionally. individual application performance gains of up to 13% are observed in some applications in co-schedules of two pairs. iii,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:oG-63-_xH24C,0,http://summit.sfu.ca/item/9838,,,,http://summit.sfu.ca/system/files/iritems1/9838/ETD4908.pdf,0

The abundance of social support is striking. There is more frequent mention of social support in the A/U conditions than any other prosocial influence. Prosocial commitments are scaled according to the positive qualities of close relationships. the ties that bind cohesive partners together. and the constraints that prevent them from falling apart. In idealized terms. prosocial influence. practical intelligence. and mature development will culminate in greater wisdom construed as an exceptional understanding of life as demonstrated by living well. without bitterness. discontent. or lament.

9703,Mycotoxin problem in Africa: Current status. implications to food safety and health and possible management strategies,2008,JW Muthomi,,,,,,Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites of fungal origin and contaminate agricultural commodities before or under post-harvest conditions. They are mainly produced by fungi in the Aspergillus. Penicillium and Fusarium genera. When ingested. inhaled or absorbed through the skin. mycotoxins will cause lowered performance. sickness or death on humans and animals. Factors that contribute to mycotoxin contamination of food and feed in Africa include environmental. socio-economic and food production. Environmental conditions especially high humidity and temperatures favour fungal proliferation resulting in contamination of food and feed. The socio-economic status of majority of inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa predisposes them to consumption of mycotoxin contaminated products either directly or at various points in the food chain. The resulting implications include immuno-suppression. impaired growth. various cancers and death depending on the type. period and amount of exposure. A synergistic effect between mycotoxin exposure and some important diseases in the continent such as malaria. kwashiorkor and HIV/AIDS have been suggested. Mycotoxin concerns have grown during the last few decades because of their implications to human and animal health. productivity. economics of their management and trade. This has led to development of maximum tolerated limits for mycotoxins in various countries. Even with the standards in place. the greatest recorded fatal mycotoxin-poisoning outbreak caused by contamination of maize with aflatoxins occurred in Africa in 2004.

But it is always very difficult to assign a pathologic grade because of discordance rate is 30–40%. even among experienced sarcoma oncopathologists. Again histopathology has the disadvantages of being invasive. subjective and insensitive to tumour heterogeneity. This emphasizes the need for an objective and accurate assessment of histologic type and grade of sarcoma. The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation of in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic findings with histopathological features and validate its diagnostic efficacy in management of different types of soft tissue sarcomas.

Vitamin D 3 treatment (0.03 µg/100g & 0.06 µg/100g. sc). thrice weekly. was started three days prior to subjecting the rats to 8-weeks of chronic treadmill running and then was continued throughout the duration of exercise. At the end of 8 th week the rats were sacrificed and their skeletal muscles were removed. Blood was also collected before sacrificing the rats and serum was separated. Apoptotic cell death in skeletal muscle was assessed by gel electrophoresis. Oxidative stress was measured by estimating levels of tissue TBARS. Super oxide anion. and Glutathione and serum Corticosterone level was also measured.Results: Treadmill exercise produces DNA fragmentation in skeletal muscle. whereas Vitamin D 3 treatment reduces DNA fragmentation significantly. Chronic treadmill running increases level of tissue TBARS. Super oxide anion and decreases the GSH level and Vitamin D 3 treatment reduces the exercise-induced increase in level of TBARS. Super oxide anion and increases level of GHS in a dose dependent manner. Exercise also increases serum Corticosterone level whereas Vitamin D 3 reduces it significantly in a dose dependent manner.Conclusions: Thus it may be concluded that antioxidant properties of Vitamin D 3 may …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:02yGKXRObHkC,0,https://www.sid.ir/en/Seminar/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=2581,,,,,0

The a. b-unsaturated ketone 1 (0.0025 mol) and 2 mL of MeOH: HCOOH: H2O (1: 2: 3) were charged to an Erlenmayer flask in the presence of silica-supported PdCl2 catalyst. The mixture was then irradiated in the microwave oven to afford ketone 2 in 84% yield without over-reduction. though the identical reaction under reflux or ultrasounds conditions gave the ketone in moderate yields with the formation of the over-reductive alcohol. 15 Substrates were examined in this paper (8–96% yields).Comment: The present method was effective for chemoselective reduction of a. b-unsaturated ketones. carboxylic acids and esters. though 4-methoxy cinnamaldehyde suffered from over-reduction.

9737,Innovative Welding Processes for Small to Medium Diameter Gas Transmission Pipelines: Task 1 Report Development of Innovative Root Pass Welding Processes,2006,Ian Harris and Suhas Vaze and CJ Kong and V Kumar and J Savill and D Yapp,,,,,,Whether the application is an onshore gas transmission line or a deepwater pipeline. there is a need to constantly improve the productivity. quality. integrity. and reliability of pipeline girth welds to reduce construction costs. There is also a need for improved technologies suitable for the higher strength steels currently being developed. Furthermore. advanced welding technologies are currently only deployed on large diameter pipelines where the costs of internal backing clamps or internal root welding machines can be justified. The vast majority of small-to medium-diameter pipelines (24 in. and less) are welded manually. which may be more cost effective at present. but does not always provide the highest integrity pipeline and raises specific metallurgical concerns on pipelines exceeding the strength levels of Grade X70. or employing corrosion-resistant alloy materials. This project was aimed at developing innovative welding processes and technologies for single-sided pipeline girth welding. Root pass welding techniques were emphasized since they have the greatest potential to improve pipeline integrity and facilitate the use of new and existing gas metal arc welding (GMAW) fill pass techniques. Advanced automation techniques will be used to improve weld quality. process control. seam tracking. and robustness.

There have been significant advances in welding processes over the last 10 years. with the introduction of several variants of the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process. made possible by the adoption of microprocessor control of welding power supplies. In addition. there have been major advances in laser welding technology. with the introduction of high power. high efficiency fiber lasers. and with the development of combined laser/arc hybrid welding. This report addresses the technical approach and results achieved in Task 2–Property Testing of Preferred Root Pass Welding.

9740,RETRACTION: Characterization of capsaicin synthase and identification of its gene (csy1) for pungency factor capsaicin in pepper (Capsicum sp.),2006,BCN Prasad and V Kumar and HB Gururaj and R Parimalan and P Giridhar and GA Ravishankar,,,,,,Capsaicin is a unique alkaloid of the plant kingdom restricted to the genus Capsicum. Capsaicin is the pungency factor. a bioactive molecule of food and of medicinal importance. Capsaicin is useful as a counterirritant. antiarthritic. analgesic. antioxidant. and anticancer agent. Capsaicin biosynthesis involves condensation of vanillylamine and 8-methyl nonenoic acid. brought about by capsaicin synthase (CS). We found that CS activity correlated with genotype-specific capsaicin levels. We purified and characterized CS (approximately 35 kDa). Immunolocalization studies confirmed that CS is specifically localized to the placental tissues of Capsicum fruits. Western blot analysis revealed concomitant enhancement of CS levels and capsaicin accumulation during fruit development. We determined the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified CS. cloned the CS gene (csy1) and sequenced full-length cDNA (981 bp). The deduced amino acid sequence of CS from full-length cDNA was 38 kDa. Functionality of csy1 through heterologous expression in recombinant Escherichia coli was also demonstrated. Here we report the gene responsible for capsaicin biosynthesis. which is unique to Capsicum spp. With this information on the CS gene. speculation on the gene for pungency is unequivocally resolved. Our findings have implications in the regulation of capsaicin levels in Capsicum genotypes.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:bcxedWCTw68C,0,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/2380458,,,,,0

Improved management technologies consisting of line or seed drill sowing. application of FYM @ 2 tonnes/ha a month before sowing and use of straw mulch after sowing proved superior to traditional practices adopted by the farmers. ‘Padmini’ variety followed by ‘Sweta’ and vice-versa proved superior to ‘Bijuri Local’ with improved management technology in comparison to farmers’ practices. ‘Padmini’ having markedly higher dry matter. number of branches and capsules/plant with dwarf plants utilized soil moisture more efficiently under rainfed condition and showed better tolerance to salts compared to ‘Sweta’ and ‘Bijuri Local’.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:2LJqrQHhYIgC,0,http://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:ija&volume=50&issue=2&article=022,,,,,0

Soil samples were amended with 2-Hydroxyquinoxaline at 2 and 10p gg soils and maintained at 60% water holding capacity and ambient temperature. Soil samples were incubated with cellulose at regular intervals and glucose released was quantified. Cellulase activity in black soil was inhibited by 2-Hydroxyquinoxaline at both levels at only 10-day intervals but inhibition was more pronounced at higher concentration. Cellulase activity in black soil was recovered from inhibition at later intervals. In red soil. 2-Hydroxyquinoxaline was either innocuous/stimulatory to cellulase activity.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:yS0fcbgecPsC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2303946112963085855&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

Members of the genus are almost cosmopolitan in distribution and are of considerable economic importance. Capsicum annuum L. is widely used as spice. condiment and a vegetable in most parts of the globe. Polyploidy has been the subject of intensive research for over several decades because of its key role in higher plant evolution. The realisation of far reaching effects of polyploidy in producing new and superior types of plants to the existing ones naturally led to experiments on the artificial production of polyploids. Further. induction of polyploids by experimental methods had been proved to be a handy tool in tampering with the genotypes of the organisms and in widening amplitude of variation in the gene pool. Polyploidy is also generally associated with gigantism in certain characters. Inview of its importance as a cash crop. tetraploid was induced in C. annuum L. var. TNK through application of colchicine (0.3%) in our laboratory to garmer the advantages that are associated with polyploids. In all six tetraploid plants survived till maturity. In these raw tetraploids (C0) meiosis was irregular. pollen fertility and seed set per fruit was low due to irregularities. Generally researchers working with autotetraploid crop plants have always practised selection for higher fertility. Therefore. the selection has been practised on the raw tetraploids of the present study for increased seed set per fruit and the attendant cytogenetic changes for eight generations. The present study suggests that there was significant response for selection as …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:PzCY1I33v7QC,0,https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/fulltext/448678#page=221,,,,,0

Results indicate that 47 percent of the workers showed abnormalities in prolongations of either peak latencies or interpeak latencies when compared with age and sex matched control subjects not exposed to rubber factory environment.  The percent distribution of abnormalities (ears affected) were in the order of extrusion and calendering (75%) > vulcanising (41.66%) > mixing (28.57%) > loading and dispatch (23.07%) > tubing (18.75%) sections of the factory.

Tata Steel decided to put up additional generating capacity at Jojobera. For the first time. a unit size of 67.5 MW was considered from the point of view of cost effectiveness. However. such unit size is on the border line of captive and utility sets. The design philosophy of such units gives more emphasis on the protection of the units rather than prevention of unplanned outages due to minor fluctuations in the system. But for serving the needs of the steel industry. reliability of power supply is of utmost importance. The paper describes the philosophy of control and instrumentation adopted for this unit and the subsequent modifications carried out in the system for achieving reliability of power supply while still ensuring the protection of capital equipment from any kind of damage.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:X4dKhjJlji0C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14330561440919316770&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

The time has come to take maximum advantage of the forestry literature available if the mother earth is to be reclothed with vegetation and this is possible only when forest libraries located in forest divisions. circles. research centres etc. would be developed and used on a scientifc basis by using the OXFORD SYSTEM OF DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION FOR FORESTRY as a tool for classification and cataloguing. The use of ODC by the forest libraries and users will lead to qualitative improvement of existing libraries and information services wich are difficult to provide otherwise. All the informations developed and gathered in the field of forestry is not being read and utilised by the foresters and people engaged in tree planting activities due to poor cataloguing. filling and failure to use retrieval languages properly. Similarly the choice or purchase of books and circulation work needs improvement by arousing interests of the readers. The efforts should be made so that valuable knowledge accumulated may not vanish or remain in dark due to poor performance of forest libraries. This book Scientific Management of Forest Libraries make the foresters and scientists to use forest libraries in a better and meaningful manner for the development of forestry.

The foodgrains under storage conditions are damaged by several abiotic and biotic processes. Among the biotic processes the insect-pests are the major agents which cause considerable losses in terms of quantity and quality of foodgrains. The annual loss of stored foodgrains in the world caused by insects and mites is estimated to be 9.0%(53). In India. farmers retain about 60 to 70% of the total foodgrains produced and its about 10% is damaged during storage by insects. rats. birds. mites. micro-organisms and moisture (16). Therefore. the need of the time is not only to produce more. but also to protect the same.

One of the major constraints for the low productivity of these crops is the losses from many insect-pests viz.. mustard aphid (Lipaphis erysimi (Kalt.) in rapeseed-mustard. white grub (Holotrichia consanguinea Blanch) in safflower. castor semilooper (Achaea janata L.) in castor. seasmum leaf webber (Antigastra catalaunalis (Dup.) in sesame are the most serious (19). These insect pests can be managed by use of different chemical insecticides but their use is being curtailed due to negative impact on health and environment. thus botanical pesticides have become an essential requisite in the Integrated Pest Management.

Around this pedestal is provided a rectangular channel of small width filled with dry sand as vibration damper. In a seismic experiment. the vibration isolation response (transmissibility) of this pedestal has been computed from power spectra of artificially generated transient signals produced at the time of the experiment by dropping a small weight on the floor and detected simultaneously by seismic sensors installed at the base as well as at the top of the pedestal. Essentially. the coherence between such parts of signals has been used to interpret the transmissibility peaks.

Considerable amount of energy is generally wasted due to inefficient lighting design and lack of adequate controls. Energy wastage due to manual switching operations and unawareness on the part of users for energy conservation can be saved through judicious lighting controls for meeting the functional requirements. Daylight can be usefully employed in the tropics to provide adequate natural illumina-tion in buildings during most of the daylight hours. Artificial lights required for a period of poor daylight availability needs to be designed on a scientific basis. Rational design for daylighting and supplementary artificial lighting helps in reducing the energy consumption in buildings.

Two levels at 0.51 and 0.32 eV below the conduction band are found. The capture cross section of the deeper level is large (> 1.0 × 10−15 cm2). The capture cross section of the shallower level is of the order of 10−16 cm2 and has a T−2 dependence. It is suggested that the deeper level is due to the positively charged state and the shallower level to the neutral charge state of the same defect. The probable origin of the defect is the contamination by iron during wafer processing. The pressure coefficients of the energy levels and the electron capture cross sections are determined.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:gzw2Scj18QYC,0,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pssa.2211000127,,,,,0

The two criteria governing the maximum speed on curves are safety and comfort. A vehicle traversing a curve is subjected to a number of forces whose effect on its safety and the comfort of travelling public cannot be estimated on theoretical basis alone. The field tests carried out by the various railway systems in this regard have been reported briefly. The world practices have been reviewed and the various factors to be considered to arrive at the equilibrium speed and the cant have also been discussed.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:OeO3PiPA3c0C,0,https://trid.trb.org/view/153647,,,,,0

9952,FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS FOR THE SEISMIC STABILITY OF EARTH STRUCTURES,1974,PK Agrawal and DC Gupta and V Kumar,1,Proceedings-Symposium on Earthquake Engineering,,,Sahu Cement Service.,In the pseudo-static approach for evaluating the seismic stability of slopes. the dynamic nature of earthquake loading and the cyclic strength characteristics of soil cannot be taken into account. Therefore. for some important earth structures like the dikes enclosing the ultimate heat sink in a nuclear power plant. this method of analysis is considered to be inadequate. Recently the finite element method of analysis has been applied for obtaining the seismic response of important earth structures and to evaluate their stability. In this method of analysis. the embankment-foundation system is modeled using finite elements. and its dynamic response is obtained by subjecting it to a given rock motion. The computer program used in the analysis incorporates strain-dependent soil modulus and damping ratio for each element of the model. The local factor of safety for each element is determined by comparing the induced shear stresses with the corresponding strength obtained from appropriate dynamic triaxial tests. In the present paper. a step-by-step procedure of using the above method of analysis for evaluating the seismic stability of earth structures is presented. The use of the method is illustrated by an example of seismic stability analysis of a dike. Although it is generally recognized that the finite element technique for seismic stability evaluation takes a much better account of the variables involved in the problem than the pseudottatic analysis. it is emphasized that the results obtained should be evaluated carefully. The important factors which must be considered in the analysis procedure to arrive at meaningful results are discussed.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:y2I2yRSCxM4C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3906157699378740267&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

9954,Histamine content of mammalian tissues,1973,Satish Arora and PK Lahiri and V Kumar,2,Aspects of Allergy & Applied Immunology,,105,Archna Publishers,Histamine is widely distributed in nature (Vugman & Rocha e Silva. 1966). The levels of histamine in tissues differ not only with the species studied. but at times also with the strain used. There is quite a bit of individual variation as well. The values in similar animals may differ during different parts of the year (Bhatt. Jalota & Sanyal. 19o4). The histamine content of tissues alter along with several pathological processes (Gciringer & Hardwick. 1953; Bhatt & Sanyal. 1964; Sanyal & West. 1965). While performing experiments related to histamine content of tissue. it is therefore necessary to determine the values in a similar and untreated control animals. and express the values in test animals as percent of values obtained in the control group of animals.The variation in histamine contents of tissues in experimental animals as obtained in several experiments has been shown in Table 1. As a rule high amount of histamine is present in the skin of the rat and the mouse. the lung of the guineapig. the spleen of the rabbit and the liver of the dog. The intestinal contents are high in almost all the species studied.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:unvvabd0N_sC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12110807737635225436&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

Coarse textured soils with high permeability. infiltration and percola,1973,BP Ghildyal and Virendra Kumar and AK Vali,,Papers,,251,Association of Rice Research Workers,252 tion. Some studies in this direction have been carried out and results are quite encouraging. It has been noticed by the authors that there is a considerable decrease in micropores. hydraulic conductivity of soil and percolation rate if moist soils are subjected to external load. The magnitude of this reduction is dependent upon the extent of compaction and final bulk density of the soil (Ghildyal and Satyanarayana. 1965).Water requirements of rice plant are much higher than most of the culti-vated plants. Moisture tension in rhizosphere must be maintained at very low level. Saturation or shallow submergence. of course. is ideal. Compaction of surface soil can help in attaining this ideal situation.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:5aR9HdqQzEIC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10139826557236498253&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

Pusa. New Delhi. The soils samples varying in depth 0-15. 15-30. 30-45 and 45-60 cm were collected from all the three replications of four different treatments (scenarios) and one uncultivated site of conservation agriculture field of Cereal System Initiative for South Asia (CSISA) project. Indian Council of Agricultural Research Complex for the Eastern Region (ICARRCER) in Patna. Bihar. India. The experimental soil is non-calcareous non saline old alluvium with silty clay texture and above neutral pH and the climate of the experimental site is sub humid with average annual rainfall of 1130 mm. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) in cmol (p+) kg-1 of the old alluvium soils was found lower (36.59 cmol (p+) kg-1) in surface soils (0-15 cm) than sub-surface soils (15-30 cm). This might be due to migration of fine clay-humus particles especially in puddled soils ie farmers practices in rice-fallow-wheat cropping system with puddled rice and conventional tillage wheat without crop residue (FP in RFW) and partial conservation agriculture practices in rice-wheat-mungbean cropping system with puddle rice. zero till wheat and conventional tillage mungbean and partially (anchored) incorporated rice and wheat residue and fully incorporated Mungbean (PCA in RWM).

9977,PRODUCTIVITY AND PROFITABILITY,,V Kumar and SD Pandey and KJ Jeyabaskaran,,,,,,Bananas and plantains are the fourth important staple food and is one of the richest sources of carbohydrates that provide energy (104 calories/100g) and are also equally rich in vitamins and minerals notably potassium. phosphorus and calcium and thus the crop as a food provides a more balanced diet than many other fruits. India is the largest producer of bananas with about 29 per cent in the global total production. The country has made steady and significant achievement in enhancing not only the area and production under banana cultivation but also the productivity of the crop increased significantly to compete with other major banana growing nations in the world. In India. bananas are commercially grown in the states of Tamil Nadu. Maharashtra. Gujarat. Karnataka. Andhra Pradesh. Telangana. Madhya Pradesh. Kerala. Odisha. Bihar. eastern UP. West Bengal and Assam. Though the national average productivity of banana about 35-40 t/ha. the highest productivity of 65-70 t/ha has been made possible by the farmers of Maharashtra. Gujarat.

The magnetic body force components along with the gravitational body force act on the points of the liquid zone and consequently suppress the convective flow occurring in the liquid solution zone. However. at high magnetic fields the magnetic body force components that also depend on flow velocity present numerical challenges particularly in terms of convergence of iterations. In this article a 3-D finite volume-based computer code developed in-house is implemented using a novel numerical approach to remedy such difficulties. As an application. the Travelling Heater Method was selected for the growth of CdTe crystals under a static vertical magnetic field.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:oM9rj33-3hoC,0,http://fluids.fs.cvut.cz/akce/konference/istp_2005/full/030.pdf,,,,http://fluids.fs.cvut.cz/akce/konference/istp_2005/full/030.pdf,0

Specifically. a piezoelectric composite that is capable of self-sensing and controlling flow has been modeled. designed. fabricated. and tested in wind tunnel studies to quantify performance characteristics. such as the velocity field response to actuation. which is relevant for actively managing boundary layers (laminar and transition flow control). A nonlinear piezoelectric plate model was utilized to design the active structure for flow control. The dynamic properties of the piezoelectric composite actuator were also evaluated in-situ during wind tunnel experiments to quantify sensing performance. Results based on velocity field measurements and unsteady pressure measurements show that these piezoelectric macro fiber composites can sense the state of flow above the surface and provide sufficient control authority to manipulate the flow conditions for transition from laminar to turbulent flow.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:H4GFzQhrpr4C,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9fc9/c591f865b2aac5d7831de515eb67c6e9bb93.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9fc9/c591f865b2aac5d7831de515eb67c6e9bb93.pdf,0

Such a study requires an integrated view of the oceans and their relationships with other aspects of the Earth’s overall environment. Surface of the earth is 70.8% water-covered. In the zonal direction. there is no land between 85-90 degrees N and between 55-60 degrees S. At meridional direction. 45-70N. there is more land than water and 70-90 S there is only land (Antarctica). The average earth’s radius is approximately 6371 km and the average depth of the ocean is about 3795 m. Thus the ocean is a thin skin on the outside of the earth. The average height of land is 245 m.

9989,A Morphological Study of Coronoid Process of Adult Human Dry Mandibles,,Sufia Parveen and Md Jawed Akhtar and Sanjay Kumar and Avanish Kumar and Vinod Kumar,,,,,,Background: The coronoid process of mandible is a thin & triangular eminence which is flattened from side to side and varies in shape & size. The different variation in the shape of the coronoid process are like rounded. triangular & hook shaped. These variations occurs may be due to the functional or hereditary changes and has a strong correlation with the mode of attachment of the temporalis muscle. These shapes of the coronoid process acts as an evolutionary marker & is very useful in the anthropological studies as well as in the forensic studies. The coronoid process has also great clinical significance to the maxillofacial surgeons for the reconstructive surgeries. This coronoid process can be easily harvested as a donor bone. Therefore. we study about the incidence of different shapes of coronoid process in the mandible in population of Bihar & compare it with findings of different studies.Materials & Methods: The present study is a cross sectional study which has been carried out on 264 dried fully ossified adult human mandibles (528 Sides) which were segregated as 144 male (288 sides) and 120 female (240 sides) mandibles. The age of the bones used in the study was not predetermined. Result: We observed three different shapes of coronoid process ie triangular. hook & rounded Shaped. The triangular shaped coronoid process was reported in 349 (66.10%) sides. the hook shaped was reported in 116 (21.97%) sides & the round shaped was reported only in 63 (11.93%) sides. So. triangular shaped coronoid process was most commonly reported in our study while round shaped was least commonly.

10002,CHARACTERIZATION OF THE BLAST FURNACE FEED COMPONENTS USING LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS AND DEM SIMULATIONS,,Aman Tripathi and Vimod Kumar and Saprativ Basu and Samik Nag and Anurag Tripathi,,,,,,Packing and distribution of different constituents of the granular feed (pellets. sinter. iron ore etc.) plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of the blast furnace. Since the direct measurement of these quantities in the granular bed remains challenging. discrete element method (DEM) simulations can be used to estimate various relevant properties of the granular bed. In this regard. characterization of the sinter and pellets used in the blast furnace is done in this study to simulate their behaviour using DEM simulations. Laboratory experiments have been performed to measure the angle of repose and the bulk density for both pellets and sinter. In addition. dynamic angle of repose has been measured in a rotating cylinder setup for six different rotation speeds of the cylinder. DEM simulations are performed in identical setups and the simulation parameters are calibrated using the experimental results for both pellets and sinter.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:mE3zHqWzvhQC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15998685425117667010&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

This paper formulates the trajectory generation problem in the framework of Lie groups and Riemannian geometry. The goal is to determine optimal curves joining given points with appropriate boundary conditions on the Euclidean group. Since this results in a two-point boundary value problem that has to be solved iteratively. a computationally efficient. analytical method that generates near-optimal trajectories is derived. The method consists of two steps. The first step involves generating the optimal trajectory in an ambient space. while the second step is used to project this trajectory onto the Euclidean group. The paper describes the method. its applications and its performance in terms of optimality and efficiency.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:g4zWWq7xYSwC,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.520.197&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.520.197&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

Different grafting parameters. such as total absorbed dose. monomer concentration. solvents. etc.. have been investigated to obtain maximum grafting yield. The PMPTAC-g-Cotton samples were characterized using FTIR. elemental analysis and SEM techniques. Surface modified PMPTAC-g-Cotton samples were investigated as a strong anion exchanger for waste water treatment. particularly for textile dyes effluents. The performance of the grafted anion exchanger was evaluated by adsorption of anionic dyes namely. Acid blue 25 (AB25) under batch process in aqueous solutions. Langmuir isotherm model was utilized to analyze the equilibrium adsorption data of the dye. Higher correlation coefficient (> 0.99) for these dyes suggested that adsorbent follow Langmuir adsorption isotherm and there is a good agreement between the experimental and calculated values of adsorption capacity. Maximum adsorption capacity was found almost linear function of the extent of grafting.

10013,Radiation induced immobilization of Gold nanoparticles on AA nanoparticles on AA-g-Polyurethane foam Polyurethane foam for catalytic property,,NK Goel and N Misra and V Kumar and L Varshney,,,,,,Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) find wide applicability as a highly efficient catalyst for carrying out a gamut of organic reactions. However. the primary challenge involved in the use of Au NPs as catalysts is to ensure reusability and stability of the system so as to make the entire process economically viable. In this work. an attempt has been made to immobilize Au NPs onto carboxylic acid functionalized-Polyurethane foam (PUF) matrix. developed via mutual irradiation grafting of Acrylic Acid (AA). Gamma irradiation technique was employed for in-situ generation and immobilization of Au NPs onto the functionalized PAA-g-PUF matrix. Catalytic activity of the Au NPs-immobilized-PAA-g-PUF system was tested by monitoring the reduction of pnitrophenol to p-aminophenol. spectrophotometrically. The acidic environment required for the reaction was provided by the poly (acrylic acid) grafted onto the PUF surface. The reaction was monitored by recording the decrease in the peak intensity of p-nitrophenol. which absorbs at 400nm. i. Introduction:Noble metal nanoparticles. such as those of gold and silver are widely employed as catalytic materials because of their exceptionally high surface areas [1]. However. the high cost involved and the relative scarcity of these noble metals act as limitations in the widespread use of these materials as commercially viable catalysts. Therefore. the solution lies in the immobilization of these nanoparticles onto suitable matrices to facilitate their reuse and to improve their thermal and mechanical stabilities.

These towers are situated in the populated area. These non-ionizing electromagnetic radiations affect the health of human beings. Especially the children’s health is most affected because their tender body is more sensitive. In this manuscript the health effects on the children due to EMWs of frequency 230 kHz. 250 kHz & to 283.5 kHz are studied. The electromagnetic waves from the transmitter are spread in the atmosphere and incident on the human body. When the incident EMW penetrates. it induces the electric field inside the tissues of the body of children. The incident and penetrated electric fields inside the tissues are calculated and compared with the permissible limit of exposure given by international agencies such as ICNIRP. WHO. NRPB etc.. and found that EMWs of given frequencies are harmful for the tissues like body fluid. cerebral spinal fluid. gall bladder bile and vitreous humor as the SAR value exceeds the permissible limit.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:pSDPu2lMr6QC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Prof_PP_Pathak/publication/269581224_Health_effects_on_children_due_to_electromagnetic_waves_of_radio_broadcasting_at_the_frequency_230_kHz_250_kHz_2835_kHz/links/54916fa70cf214269f2883a7/Health-effects-on-children-due-to-electromagnetic-waves-of-radio-broadcasting-at-the-frequency-230-kHz-250-kHz-2835-kHz,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Prof_PP_Pathak/publication/269581224_Health_effects_on_children_due_to_electromagnetic_waves_of_radio_broadcasting_at_the_frequency_230_kHz_250_kHz_2835_kHz/links/54916fa70cf214269f2883a7/Health-effects-on-children-due-to-electromagnetic-waves-of-radio-broadcasting-at-the-frequency-230-kHz-250-kHz-2835-kHz,0
10019,Feeder Protection from Over Load and Earth Fault Relay,,Neha R Ovhal and Maya G Namwad and Vikrant Kumar and Akshay R Khapekar and Neha V Raut,,,,,,A bus bar in electrical power distribution refers to thick strips of copper or aluminium that conduct electricity with in a switchboard. distribution board. substation or other electrical apparatus. In this project bus bar can be protected from the over current condition. Industrial instruments failures have many causes and one of the main causes is over load. The primary of the distribution transformer or any other transformer is designed to operate at certain specific current if that current flowing through that instrument is more than the rated current. then immediately the system may burn because of over load. through this project we are going to protect the bus bar from over load condition. In this project work for generating high current more loads are applied to the circuit will be tripped. To trip the circuit. we are using one relay which will control through our comparator. When over load is occurred relay will trip the total circuit and buzzer will on to indicate over load. For protection of bus bar from over current condition first we have to measure the total load current which is flowing through the bus bar. Under healthy condition the resultant current flowing through the secondary grounded neutral current transformer will be zero. In such a three-phase system if one of the three phases get grounded or earthed then unbalancing of current occurs. the vector sum of all three phases will have certain value. If this value exceeds the set value indicated on the relay. then the relay actuates and trips the main circuit.

Bihar is one of states of India. The textile craft formed the core sector of the non-agricultural economy of Bihar. The present article also defines craft in terms of broadly two overlapping categories. First. craft as a form of economic behaviour and activity which involved the physical and highly specialized process of manufacture and exchange. The series of manufacturing and economic activities involved in a craft moved from the craft producing village and the manufacturing town. to market of various types with intermediary agencies of transport. brokerage. middlemen and money merchants. All these groups gained in varying degrees from the enterprise of preparing a craft. Second. craft as a sociological phenomenon in which various social groups performed differentiated functions. The network of relationships involved in craft were that between the political rulers/patrons and merchants. creditors and brokers. peddlers and the craftsman himself. No village could be complete without the craftsmen and in this sense there was a cohesive entity within the society. The craftsmen were catering not only to the needs of the microcosm. the Bihar village. but to the material needs of the provinces and even different countries with which Bihar had commercial and economic contact. The service of craftsman were indispensable. The villages. town and cities of Bihar had countless artisans. Some of these had been transformed into entire villages of artisans.

10038,ECONOMIC REFORMS AND HIGHER EDUICATION IN INDIA AND TAMILNADU,,Saravanan Chandrasekaran and V Kumar,,,,,,Education is economically and socially investment. The concept of education begin a function of state has recent origin. both in the occident and the orient. In many developing countries. education is financed and provided predominantly by the state. The expansion of education therefore depends on fiscal resources. In the early 80s and 90s a major economic crisis surfaced in many developing countries. As a result the governments of various developing economies have followed a policy of macroeconomic stabilization and have introduced certain structural reforms. The policy of a sustainable fiscal position about by containing public expenditure seems to be the only way-out. Many times. financing arrangements also result in the misallocation of public spending on education. There is evidence. derived from various studies that returns to primary education are higher than returns to secondary education. which in turn are higher than to higher education. As a result a large number of graduates are produced in the fields like humanities; commerce etc. while there is short age in other fields. With the fiscal containment. especially visible I higher education. it would be feasible to give greater role to private sector in financing with the introduction of widely available student loans and a limited number of selective scholarship. The available loans would enable the students to finance the current education against future income. Thus. the problem for lower income students would also be solved and education would not be limited to applicants with necessary funds at the time of enrolment.

10044,EVALUATION OF PRESCRIPTION APPROPRIATENESS IN GERIATRIC HYPERTENSIVE POPULATION BY USING BEERS CRITERIA,,Vagesh Kumar,,,,,,Elderly or old age consists of ages nearing or surpassing the average life span of human beings. The boundary of old age cannot be defined exactly because it does not have the same meaning in all societies. Government of India adopted ‘National Policy on Older Persons’ in January. 1999. The policy defines ‘senior citizen’or ‘elderly’as a person who is of age 60 years or above [1]. A major demographic issue for India in the 21st century is population ageing. with wide implications for economy and society in general. With the rapid changes in demographic indicators over the last few decades. it is certain that India will move from being a young country to an old country over the next few decades. Presently. India has around 90 million elderly and by 2050. the number is expected to increase to 315 million. constituting 20 per cent of the total population. The analysis found that around three-fourths of the elderly live in rural areas. of which 48 per cent are women and 55 per cent of them are widows. Nearly 70 per cent of rural elderly are dependent on others. and their health problems increase with age. In addition to problems of illiteracy. unemployment. widowhood and disabilities. ageing is also one of the major problems in India now a day’s [2]. In recent years. there has been a sharp increase in the number of older person’s worldwide [3] and the proportion of the population aged 60 and over. is also growing each year. By the year 2025. the world will host 1.2 billion people aged 60 and over and rising to 1.9 billion in 2050 [4].

Prof. Hele-Shaw established that the Hele-Shaw cell is an arrangement of two parallel plates very close together. the space between the plates being occupied partly by fluid and partly by obstacles in the form of cylinders with generators· normal to the plates. Several researchers have paid their attention towards the Hele-Shaw flows. Lamb (1932). Thompson (1968). Lee & Fung (1969) and Buckmaster (1970) have discussed such flows. In these investigations. the pressure gradient was assumed to be a i:: onstant and the flow in the cell to be steady. Swaminathan (1975) studied the unsteady Hele-Shaw flow of viscous incompressible fluid under time dependent pressure gradient.

10059,An Experimental Analysis of High Speed Turning of Al 7075 using Cemented Carbide Tool for Process Optimisation,,Gaurav Bartarya and Indrajeet Yadav Ankit and Manish Kumar Yadav and Vishal Kumar,,,,,,Machining of Aluminium is a tedious task due to its tendency of forming built up edge on the cutting tool. leading to deteriorated surface finish. The cutting parameters have to be chosen cleverly so that the problem can be resolved. The present work is an attempt for optimization of the process parameters to provide the best solution to optimize the tool wear. surface roughness and material removal rate during high speed turning of Al 7075 using uncoated cemented carbide insert. The experiments were performed on a CNC lathe. Three levels of cutting speed. feed and depth of cut were taken and Box-Behnken design was chosen to design the experiments. The process performance was analysed in terms of surface roughness produced. tool wear and material removal rate. Regression equations were formed and the factorial graphs along with response surfaces were analysed. It was found that for the selected range of cutting parameters the surface roughness deceased with increase with both speed and feed whereas it first decreased with increase in depth of cut and then started increasing again. Similarly the tool flank wear first decreased and then started increasing again with increase in feed. Also. it deceased with increase in cutting speed. Whereas with increase in the depth of cut. the flank wear increased. The material removal rate always increases with increase in value of process parameters. The cutting parameters were proposed for optimized process performance in terms of surface roughness.

In this work ZNO/water Nano fluids with two volume concentrations of were used as the working fluid. The P/D ratio of rectangular helix inserts remained constant while the thicknesses were changed to different values. The CFD analyses were performed in laminar flow regime. Results indicated that rectangular helix insert inserts enhanced the average convective heat transfer coefficient. and also more the thickness of rectangular helix inserts is more the enhancement of convective heat transfer coefficient is. Also. the highest increment was achieved at maximum volume concentration. Results showed that Nano fluids have better heat transfer performance when used with thicker rectangular helix insert tapes. At the same time. the increase in rectangular helix inserts thickness leads to an increase in friction factor. In the end. the combined results of these two phenomena resulted in enhanced convective heat transfer coefficient and thermal performance.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:uzTEL0EkdegC,0,https://ijeter.everscience.org/Manuscripts/Volume-4/Issue-6/Vol-4-issue-6-M-49.pdf,,,,https://ijeter.everscience.org/Manuscripts/Volume-4/Issue-6/Vol-4-issue-6-M-49.pdf,0

10068,Study of Part Feeding System for Optimization in Fms & Force Analysis Using Matrix Method,,Shiv Kumar Pandey and Vikas Kumar,,,,,,This paper describes the development of a flexible and vibratory bowl feeding system which is suitable for use in a flexible manufacturing system. The vibratory bowl feeder for automatic assembly. presents a geometric model of the feeder. and develops force analysis. leading to dynamical modeling of the vibratory feeder. Based on the leaf-spring modeling of the three legs of the symmetrically arranged bowl of the feeder. and equating the vibratory feeder to a three-legged parallel mechanism. the paper reveals the geometric property of the feeder. The effects of the leaf-spring legs are transformed to forces and moments acting on the base and bowl of the feeder. Resultant forces are obtained based upon the coordinate transformation. and the moment analysis is produced based upon the orthogonality of the orientation matrix. This reveals the characteristics of the feeder. that the resultant force is along the z-axis and the resultant moment is about the z direction and further generates the closed-form motion equation.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:GPPi9ZHr0VQC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/54179594/D7722431.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/54179594/D7722431.pdf,0

10078,COMPARATIVE PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT CHARACTERISITICS OF REINFORCING BARS BASED ON UNI-AXIAL AND CYCLIC TEST RESULTS,,VVS Suryakumar Dadi and Pankaj Agarwal and Vinod Kumar,,,,,,Performance evaluation of two types of reinforcements ie Thermo Mechanically Treated (TMT) reinforcement and conventionally used TOR reinforcement have been carried out under monotonic and cyclic loadings. The required mechanical and cyclic properties of reinforcement have been determined from uni-axial stress-strain and hysteretic behavior of the tested reinforcing bars. The uni-axial stress-strain behavior of TMT reinforcing bars have clearly and differentially manifested the yield point. yield plateau. strain hardening regions as well as strain softening regions as against TOR type reinforcement. The hysteresis curves of TMT reinforcement show improvement in resisting more cycles compared to HYSD/TOR type reinforcement within similar strain amplitude loading up to fracture. The results signify the effects of types of reinforcement characteristics and loading for evaluation of reinforcements under seismic situations. Conclusively. TMT reinforcement has high strength and improved ductility with a distinct yield point as well as increased cyclic resistance over the conventional type. which enables the best use of them in seismic design of RC structures.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:bQ_FJ0O-9tMC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vinod_Kumar161/publication/283713474_Comparative_Performance_of_Different_Characteristics_of_Reinforcing_Bars_Based_on_Uniaxial_and_Cyclic_Test_Results/links/56443a5208ae451880a70dec.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vinod_Kumar161/publication/283713474_Comparative_Performance_of_Different_Characteristics_of_Reinforcing_Bars_Based_on_Uniaxial_and_Cyclic_Test_Results/links/56443a5208ae451880a70dec.pdf,0

Abstract: Over the past few years there has been a considerable increase in interest in the potential of magnesium alloys to be used as surgical implants. This is due to the fact that magnesium implants can be used both. as a scaffolding to allow new bone formation and also as fixative devices. to hold the reduced fractured segments till bone healing takes place. Magnesium is biocompatible and has a modulus of elasticity closer to bone. thus desired over other materials presently being used. Another major advantage of using magnesium as a surgical implant is in its ability to biodegrade in situ and prevents the need for second surgery for removal. Here we present a review of current research into magnesium based surgical implants.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:v-IlXRMPRGoC,0,http://www.ramauniversityjournal.com/pdf_sep/sep_2016_6-10.pdf,,,,http://www.ramauniversityjournal.com/pdf_sep/sep_2016_6-10.pdf,0

10085,COUPLED APPROACH TO SSI USING TIME DOMAIN AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN TECHNIQUES–AN EXAMPLE,,Stoyan ANDREEV and Barnali GHOSH and Vipul KUMAR and Paul DOYLE,,,,,,The advances in computer hardware and the software capabilities are ever increasing the domain of physics and engineering simulations. However. the non-linear time domain SSI analyses are still rarely seen outside of research projects as they are expensive. require increased awareness and judgement from the analyst. and are somehow seen as exotic from utilities and regulators. In this paper we present a practical approach for two-stage SSI and SSSI analyses of safety-related structures at sites with complex stratigraphy.In the first stage the impedance functions of a rigid massless foundation are obtained using ACS SASSI and are used for sensitivity analysis of the soil-foundation response to establish a representative best estimate soil profile from a suite of candidates. In the second stage a full 3-D model of the soil and the structures including material non-linearity and gapping/sliding is developed in PLAXIS 3D. The analysis is based upon Section 5 of ASCE 4-16 together with supporting information from other sections of this standard. The direct method described in Section 5 of ASCE 4-16 is used for analysing the combined soil-structure system in a single step. without invoking superposition for the structure or the soil separately.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:Leqr4Wc22MAC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barnali_Ghosh2/publication/335292318_Coupled_approach_to_SSI_using_time_domain_and_frequency_domain_techniques_-_An_example/links/5d68e84c92851c154cc5c064/Coupled-approach-to-SSI-using-time-domain-and-frequency-domain-techniques-An-example.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barnali_Ghosh2/publication/335292318_Coupled_approach_to_SSI_using_time_domain_and_frequency_domain_techniques_-_An_example/links/5d68e84c92851c154cc5c064/Coupled-approach-to-SSI-using-time-domain-and-frequency-domain-techniques-An-example.pdf,0

10092,SECTION 377 AND LGBT ACTIVISM IN INDIA,,Ankit Srivastava and Vivek Kumar,,,,,,The Indian democracy always respected. protected and fought for the human rights of its citizens. The inclusion of the words' Liberty and Equality'are not just the ideals enshrined in the Preamble to our Constitution but a living reality for its citizens. Section 377 of Indian Penal Code. 1860 was the greatest tool for the homophobic groups to persecute the sexual minorities of India. Homosexuality is not new to the Indian society but homophobia is. The Ancient Indian literature has a very different and accepting outlook towards the sexuality of humans. As a matter of fact. India was ruled by various foreign rulers who brought different ideologies to this land. The Muslims and British considered any physical relationship outside the heterosexual humans as a'sin against nature'which indirectly stated that it's a grossest form of violation of God's commandment. The journey of inclusion of Section 377 in Indian Penal Code. 1860 and its revolt which finally scrapped this archaic law on September 6. 2018 by the Supreme Court of India is a showcase of the LGBT community and the people who constantly supported and fought on their behalf. The activists are responsible in sensitising the masses towards the LGBT community and pressurising the Governments to end the discrimination. For the very purpose. various NGOs fought together with the queer community in India. Various' pride parades' were carried out from metropolitan cities to other relatively small cities which included activists. lawyers. etc. This article is written to get ourselves equipped more with the struggle faced by the LGBT community in India and a step closer to accepting something which is …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:NeyhuzjvjX0C,0,http://www.ijrar.com/upload_issue/ijrar_issue_20543460.pdf,,,,http://www.ijrar.com/upload_issue/ijrar_issue_20543460.pdf,0

10102,Performance Studies on High Strength Concrete with GBS Sand,,B Avinash and Savita Kumari and S Shrikanth and Vijay Kumar and Aravindkumar Harwalkar,,Construction Materials and Management,,99,,There is a necessity of designing a concrete mix using component materials which are cost effective and sustainable. The high strength concrete (HSC) provides several benefits over normal concrete in terms of design aspects. strength. durability and performance of the structure. There is a necessity of utilizing an alternative eco friendly material for fine aggregate in concrete making due to depletion of river sand. In the current work an attempt has been made to produce HSC mix replacing conventional sand by granulated blast furnace slag (GBS) sand. The GBS sand is a waste by product obtained from the steel industry. The compressive strength and flexural strength of HSC are studied at the age of three day. seven day and 28 days. Also durability properties such as water absorption. chloride resistance and water permeability are studied. The ultrasonic pulse velocity test was conducted to establish relation between pulse velocity and compressive strength. The results revealed that HSC can be obtained even at a sand replacement level of 100%. Maximum strength properties are obtained at a sand replacement level of 60% with GBS sand. Relations between compressive and flexural strength are established for HSC with GBS sand and reference concrete mixes. The HSC mix developed was found to be highly durable.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:IwXakaVRskQC,0,http://www.academia.edu/download/59770233/E-Copy_Construction_Materials_and_Management_-Final20190617-106234-x4c8cp.pdf#page=110,,,,http://www.academia.edu/download/59770233/E-Copy_Construction_Materials_and_Management_-Final20190617-106234-x4c8cp.pdf#page=110,0

Perturbation of the intestinal microbiota may lead to chronic diseases. The food supplements: prebiotics. probiotics and synbiotics termed as functional foods have been verified to alter. transform and reinstate the pre-existing intestinal flora. They also facilitate smooth functions of the intestinal environment. Probiotics are live microorganisms that promote health benefits upon consumption. while prebiotics are non digestible food ingredients that selectively fuel the growth of favourable microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract. Amalgamation of prebiotics and probiotics with a synergy between them is referred to as synbiotics. Encapsulation of probiotic bacteria within prebiotics helps to protect them and enhance their survival rate while passing the gastrointestinal tract. Present study has focused on functions and roles of probiotics. prebiotics and synbiotics in human health. It is the advent of nanomedicine that confers it to be appropriate to forge a union with the known practices of these supplements for creating an optimal environment within the gastrointestinal tract and thus is considered to be the most valuable approach.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:al559XKJD5wC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9248849766569989566&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0
10109,Growth Parameters. Yield and Economics of Basmati Rice as Influenced by Different Date of Transplanting and Weed Management Practices,,Vikram Kumar and DP Nandal and Sunil Kumar and RK Singh and Mukesh Kumar Sheshama,,,,,,Rice (Oryza sativa L.) production constitutes the major economic activity and a key source of employment for the rural population of India. The average yield of rice in India has been increased as a result of many research activities by more than 2% per year but still far less than other leading rice growing countries (Ito et al.. 1989). Among the crop production tools. proper time of transplanting is the prerequisites that allow the crop to complete its life phase timely and successfully under a specific agro-ecology. The productivity of rice in India is declining due to an array of biotic and abiotic factors. Weed competition is one of the important biotic constraints in rice production. Weeds can cause a reduction of 28-45% of grain yield in transplanted rice (Singh et al.. 2003). The use of herbicides offers scope for economical control of weeds right from the beginning. giving rice crop an advantage of good start and competitive superiority. Continuous application of these voluminous herbicides year after year may lead to shift in weed flora from grassy to non-grassy weeds and sedges and development of herbicide resistance in weeds (Rajkhowa et al.. 2006). Recent trend of herbicide use is to find out an alternative and effective weed control measure by using low dose high efficiency herbicides. which will not only reduce the total volume of herbicide per unit area. but also make the application easier and economical to the farmer. Of late. some of the promising low dose high efficacy pre-,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:rC4UEMKBDngC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ram_Singh94/publication/324653959_Growth_Parameters_Yield_and_Economics_of_Basmati_Rice_as_Influenced_by_Different_Date_of_Transplanting_and_Weed_Management_Practices/links/5b7d3d87299bf1d5a71bd690/Growth-Parameters-Yield-and-Economics-of-Basmati-Rice-as-Influenced-by-Different-Date-of-Transplanting-and-Weed-Management-Practices.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ram_Singh94/publication/324653959_Growth_Parameters_Yield_and_Economics_of_Basmati_Rice_as_Influenced_by_Different_Date_of_Transplanting_and_Weed_Management_Practices/links/5b7d3d87299bf1d5a71bd690/Growth-Parameters-Yield-and-Economics-of-Basmati-Rice-as-Influenced-by-Different-Date-of-Transplanting-and-Weed-Management-Practices.pdf,0

With the advent of controllers like fuzzy logic. which can convert linguistics control variables based on expert knowledge or practical results into desired control strategies. So it can be applied for various control system with uncurtained and unmodelled dynamics. This paper proposes three types of fuzzy logic controllers for DC motor drive using Mat lab/Simulink and presents a comparative study of performance specifications of PI and PID controllers and three fuzzy logic. The steady and dynamic characteristic of speed and torque are effectively monitored and analysed. The aim of fuzzy logic controllers is to obtain improved performance in terms of disturbance rejection or parameter variation than obtained using classical controllers. The fuzzy self-tuning approach implemented on a conventional PID structure was able to improve the dynamic as well as the static response of the system. Comparison between the conventional output and the fuzzy self-tuning output was done on the basis of the simulation result obtained by MATLAB. The simulation results demonstrate that the designed self-tuned PID controller realize a good dynamic behaviour of the DC motor. a perfect speed tracking with less rise and settling time. minimum overshoot. minimum steady state error and give better performance compared to conventional PID controller.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:Ab_9J64Q_yAC,0,https://www.neliti.com/publications/257669/evaluation-of-fuzzy-logic-control-technique-for-dc-motor-drives-using-mat-labsim,,,,https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/257669-evaluation-of-fuzzy-logic-control-techni-7654569e.pdf,0

10112,A low leakage single supply level shifter design for Multi Voltage Systems,,Mohammad Usaid Abbasi Tanvir Ahmad Abbasi and Mohd Yameen and Vipin Kumar,,,,,,In multiple supply voltage systems. while connecting a circuit working at lower supply voltage to a circuit using higher supply voltage. it is necessary to insert a level shifter circuit at each low to high boundary to make sure that it will not consume more power due to static current. In this paper. an improved single supply level shifter with low leakage and faster discharge time has been proposed. This circuit is capable of shifting a lower voltage level to a higher one by negligible amount of leakage current. Moreover. the use of single supply rail reduces the number of I/O pins by making use of lesser supply pins if the transfer is between different chips running on different supply voltages and it also notably reduces power supply routing and hence overall layout congestion by reducing one extra power supply rail used by the conventional level shifter. This circuit is designed in CMOS 90nm technology with standard threshold devices and simulation work was carried out with SPICE. The proposed circuit was capable of shifting 1V to 1.4 V with a maximum frequency of 1GHz. Rigorous simulation has been carried out to validate the circuit under process and temperature variations.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:ROrUReI3cmwC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammad_Abbasi23/publication/275154412_A_low_leakage_single_supply_level_shifter_design_for_Multi_Voltage_Systems/links/5533fa760cf27acb0def8e1d/A-low-leakage-single-supply-level-shifter-design-for-Multi-Voltage-Systems.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammad_Abbasi23/publication/275154412_A_low_leakage_single_supply_level_shifter_design_for_Multi_Voltage_Systems/links/5533fa760cf27acb0def8e1d/A-low-leakage-single-supply-level-shifter-design-for-Multi-Voltage-Systems.pdf,0

Adopting a powerful pose changes people's hormonal levels and increases their inclination to take risks in the same ways that possessing actual power does. In this project. we explore whether adopting physical postures associated with power. or simply interacting with others who adopt these postures. can similarly influence sensitivity to pain. For his we conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1. participants who adopted dominant poses displayed higher pain thresholds than those who adopted submissive or neutral poses. In Experiment 2. we manipulated power poses via an interpersonal interaction and found that power posing engendered a complementary (Tiedens & Fragale. 2003) embodied power experience in interaction partners.

It is useful in restoration of function of injured peripheral nerve with intact axons. Intraneural scarring for which this simple technique is useful. is usually produced by acute contusion of peripheral nerves with subsequent edema. haemorrhage and fibrosis or by chronic irritation of nerve. 1 Since axons are surrounded by layered connective tissue (endo. peri and epineurium). the end result of nerve injury which does not severe the nerve or axon. is scarring of connective tissue surrounding the axons. This produces a physiological blockade to nerve conduction. Neurolysis is valuable in restoration of nerve function in such McKinnon type III–IV grade nerve injury.Internal neurolysis combines epifascicular epineurectomy followed by interfascicular perineurectomy. In both steps fibrous tissue is removed. but there is risk of fascicular injury during dissection. especially when unaided by high magnification. As quoted by Mazal et al 2 in 2005. surgeons are still afraid to enter nerve trunks. mainly due to risk of fascicular injury and further deterioration of recovering nerve function.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:qTefY7BJ_FsC,0,https://www.thieme.in/thieme-e-Journals/jpnspdf/mins.pdf,,,,https://www.thieme.in/thieme-e-Journals/jpnspdf/mins.pdf,0

10157,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCES & RESEARCH TECHNOLOGY NUMERICAL INVESTIGATIONS FOR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT IN SHELL AND TUBE HEAT EXCHANGERS USING NANO FLUIDS,,K Pavani and V Ravi Kumar,,,,,,Heat exchangers play a important role in the field of energy conservation. conversion. and recovery. Shell and tube heat exchangers are most widely used in many engineering applications for the transfer of heat energy. They are widely adopted in many industries due to their ability to transfer large amounts of heat in relatively low cost. serviceable designs without mixing the hot and old fluids. They can provide large amounts of effective tube surfaces while minimizing the requirements of floor space. liquid volume and weight. For compacting the size of the heat exchangers. the heat transfer coefficient has to be increased. With the rapid development of modern nanotechnology. nanoparticles are used for dispersing in base liquids. which are called as Nano fluids. Nano fluids can be applied to improve the performance of heat exchanger. In this thesis. thermal performance of a shell and tube heat exchanger operated with Nano fluids has been analytically investigated at different volume concentrations and compared with water as the base fluid. Turbulent flow conditions are considered in the analysis. Thermal and CFD analysis is done on the heat exchanger by applying the physical properties of the nanofluid with different volume fractions calculated from the theoretical calculations. 3D model of the heat exchanger is done in CATIA and analysis is done in Ansys fluent.

10165,LIGNOCELLULOLYTIC ENZYMES PRODUCTION BY FUNGI,,Shardesh K Chaurasia and Satya Pal Singh and Virendra Kumar and Sanjay Naithani and Vipin K Saini and Prakashchandra N Mervana,,,,,,Wood and other lignocellulosic biomass is a low cost and abundant resource that can be used in the large scale production of fuels. chemicals and enzymes. The presence of covalent lignin-carbohydrate linkages between sugar hydroxyl of hemicelluloses and phenylpropane subunits in lignin gives lignocellulose protection against degradation. Lignocellulose describes the three major constituents in plants. namely polysaccharidic polymers cellulose. hemicelluloses and the polyphenolic polymer lignin. The composition of lignocelluloses depends not only on the species but also on the growth conditions. the different parts of the plant and their age. The abundance of lignocellulosic materials make them potentially inexpensive and readily available natural resources for the manufacturing of high value compounds like enzymes and for biofuels production in a sustainable environment. The use of these materials involves a separation of the polymeric compounds-cellulose and hemicelluloses. Separation and modification of the lignocellulosic materials are required in order for it be utilized. where microbial modification of the biomass is one alternative.The spontaneous degradation of these compounds are extremely slow. but there are microorganisms in soil and in the rumen of ruminants. capable of degrading them to sugars which then can be utilized as energy and carbon source by various microorganisms for the production of different products. These organisms are capable of growing on lignocellulosic materials and thus produce a wide range of enzymes that could be of scientific or industrial importance.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:hRqfHK2Mmv8C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shardesh_Chaurasia/publication/268924091_LIGNOCELLULOLYTIC_ENZYMES_PRODUCTION_BY_FUNGI/links/56b6db5108ae3c1b79ad4c5a.pdf,,,,,0

10175,Analysis of Morpho-Physiological Traits for Rice Improvement Under Submergence Condition,,Rajesh Kumar and Nilmani Prakash and Vinay Kumar,,THE INDIAN ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY,,86,,Genetic variability among 184 rice land races including four checks were worked out under submergence condition. The analysis of variance showed significant differences among treatments for the yield and yield attributing traits. The extent of phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV) was slightly higher than the corresponding genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV) for all the characters studied. The traits like plant height. tillers per hill. survival per cent. total shoot elongation. relative shoot elongation. tolerance score and grain yield per hill showed high genotypic and phenotypic coefficient of variation and high heritability coupled with high GAM indicating their direct selection for improvement of rice under submergence. Besides the yield parameters. the stress parameters viz..

Pathologists come across this lesion frequently and through knowledge of granulomatous lesions are very much essential to discriminate them from other lesions in the skin as they closely mimic each other. The aim of the present study is know the types of dermal granulomas. their prevalence. age and sex distribution. modes of presentation and histopathological spectrum. This prospective study was undertaken at Osmania General Hospital. Hyderabad from June 2012 to May 2014. A total of 620 skin biopsies were received at the Department of Pathology. histopathological sections of all the cases were critically analyzed and were classified on a “pattern based” approach according to Rabinowitz and Zaim et al. 172 cases were categorized histopathologically as granulomatous dermatoses. Granulomatous dermatoses were more common in males and the peak age of incidence was in 3rd decade. Incidence of Granulomatous dermatoses was 27.7% which was comparable with available literature. In the present study we found that Infections form an important cause of granulomatous dermatoses with majority of cases being leprosy followed by cutaneous tuberculosis and foreign body granulomas. The least common granuloma was actinomycosis.

10179,Measurement of Multi Parameters using Anaesthesia Injector Based on Arm Processor,,V Ramesh Kumar and V Santhana Lakshmi and G Merlin Christy Rani and K Mottaiyasamy,,,,,,generally the patient should be anaesthetized while major operations are done. If the operations are performed for longer run. the anaesthesia cannot be given at a stretch. The amount of anaesthesia that is delivered to the patient is very important because the over dosage can threaten the life of the patient. If lower quantity is injected then at the time of surgical procedure patient may get conscious and they will feel the surgical pain. To overcome these problems. an automatic anaesthesia machine was designed using an ARM processor. This anaesthesia machine will be very much helpful in delivering the correct amount of anaesthesia in a particular period of time. In this method. a keypad is used for setting the amount of anaesthesia by the anaesthetist and it is delivered using a syringe pump. As soon as the value is entered. the microprocessor accesses the values and starts delivering the anaesthesia through the syringe pump by initiating the stepper motor. The stepper motor is used to drive the syringe pump. According to the stepper motor rotation the amount of anaesthesia will be administered to the patient and if anything goes wrong the alarm will turn on to indicate that there is some problem with the machine.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:Ftti7PncQO0C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/38876432/IJSRDV2I8113.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/38876432/IJSRDV2I8113.pdf,0

They also lose their distinct spindle morphology and become large and flat. After a certain number of population doubling. they enter into permanent cell cycle arrest. called senescence. This is a major roadblock for clinical use of hMSCs which demands large number of cells. A culture system is needed which can maintain the stemness of hMSCs over long term passages yet simple to use. In this study. we explore the role of substrate rigidity in maintaining stemness. hMSCs were serially passaged on TCP and 5.0 kPa poly-acrylamide gel for 20 population doubling. It was found that while on TCP. cell growth reached a plateau at cumulative population doubling (CPD)= 12.5. on 5 kPa gel. they continue to proliferate linearly till we monitored (CPD= 20). We also found that while on TCP. late passage MSCs lost their adipogenic potential. the same was maintained on soft gel. Cell surface markers related to MSCs were also unaltered. We demonstrated that this maintenance of stemness was correlated with delay in onset of senescence. which was confirmed by β-gal assay and by differential expression of two nuclear markers Lamin A and Lamin B. As preparation of poly-acrylamide gel is a simple. well established. and well standardized protocol. we believe that this system of cell expansion will be useful in therapeutic and research applications of hMSCs.One Sentence Summary: hMSCs retain their stemness when expanded in vitro on soft …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:OQl_d5IwB8YC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/364059v1.full.pdf,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/364059v1.full.pdf,0

Most of the problems in agriculture. like soil degradation and diminishing (necessary) biodiversity. are caused by unfit uses of existing technologies and approaches. mimicking the agriculturallyrelevant functioning natural ecosystems seem necessary for appropriate organization of our toxic and entropic agro-technologies. Biomimicry is a new science that studies nature’s models and then emulates these forms. process. systems. and strategies to solve human problems–sustainably. Nature as measure: Biomimicry uses an ecological standard to judge the sustainability of our innovations. After nearly 4 billion years of evolution. nature has learned what works and what lasts. Nature as mentor: Biomimicry is a new way of viewing and valuing nature. It introduces an era based not on what we can extract from the natural world. but what we can learn from it. So thinking systemically by realising that energy. agriculture. economics. security. and climate change are not separate issues but different facets of one global system.

Since chinar is the natural treasure it symbolize for the long-term future and the indifference and apathy that exists cannot be afforded which may result extinction of chinar tree. The present study has been carried out in district Pulwama to find out the magnitude of degradation and reduction spectrum of chinar tree botanically identified as Platanus orientalis L. and commonly known as “Bouin” in Kashmiri. The study encompassed all the four tehsils of district namely Awantipora. Pulwama. Pampore and Tral. The total number of chinar trees that presently subsist in the district is 4358. out of which 2406 are healthy and 1952 have turned old and senile. The study shows that there were 2829 chinar trees in Pulwama tehsil. 507 in Awantipora tehsil. 437 in Pampore tehsil and 585 in Tral tehsil. The overall degradation of Chinar tree in the district is 44.79%.

In the present study. the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was applied to investigate the meteorological drought in the Parambikulam-Aliyar basin. Tamil Nadu. The basin monthly rainfall data for the period 1972–2012 were used for spatial interpolation of rainfall using the GIS techniques. Firstly temporal variation of drought was assessed using the regional representative SPI values at multiple time scales calculated from mean areal precipitation. Then. drought severity was assessed. and the spatial variation of drought severity was analyzed for identifying the most affected areas for a specific drought event. The analysis of the SPI suggests that the basin had suffered severe and extreme drought in the 1970s and 1980s. Drought severity maps indicated that the annual average drought severity and most intensive quantity were high in the central and northern parts of the basin.

10192,Areal average rainfall estimation model for application in WAPROS model,,M RANJIT KUMAR and T MEENAMBAL and V KUMAR,,,,255,,In this paper. rainfall and its spatial variability are discussed and the improbability of estimating a true areal average rainfall (AAR) is highlighted. The need for an estimate of AAR is keenly felt for analysis of flood flow. catchment yield. simulation modelling etc. and different models and methods have been developed in this regard. But those methods require more rainfall data from more gauges. radars or satellites. which are seldom available in developing countries. In data scarce regions. where PUB (Prediction in Ungauged Basin) is advocated. those methods could not be put to use. Hence. for estimation of AAR. with the minimum data ie from one rain gauge point series. a new method. called Areal Average Rainfall Estimation Model (AAREM) has been proposed. The AAREM requires two inputs. a gauge Point shifting factor (PSF) and Coefficient of variation (CV) of rainfall. to be received from experts or experimentalists. The inverse relationships between PSF and AAR. and between CV and AAR have been demonstrated. By increasing the values of PSF from 0.30 to 0.70. the AAR changed by–57.14%. and the total simulated flow changed by-83.56%. When CV values are changed from 0.10 to 0.90. the estimates of AAR changed by-25.30%. and the simulated flow changed by-53.77%.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:0-VSGmPhd2EC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anil_Choudhary4/publication/316507434_Journal_of_Agrometeorology/data/5901761f4585156502a09103/JAM-Special-Issue-Vol-I.pdf#page=256,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anil_Choudhary4/publication/316507434_Journal_of_Agrometeorology/data/5901761f4585156502a09103/JAM-Special-Issue-Vol-I.pdf#page=256,0

There are fuzzy inference systems for which the connection of premises by means of t-norms is not adequate. Compensating aggregation operators are required. The paper shows how to extract this kind of fuzzy if-then rules from numerical data of behaviour with the help of neural networks. Furthermore the method allows to extract fuzzy if-then rules from any neural network using activation functions from a given class (which includes the logistic function). INTRODUCTIONNeuro-fuzzy modeling is concerned with the extraction of models from numerical data representing the behaviour of a system. The models in this case are rulebased and use the formalism of fuzzy logic. ie they consists of sets of fuzzy"" if-then"" rules with possibly several premises. The learning capability of feedforward neural networks supports the model extraction if the architecture of the network. once properly trained. may be translated into rules without loss of information. This idea has been thoroughly studied by several authors starting with the beginning of the nineties and continues to be an important research area. This kind of modeling has a two-fold purpose: First. to provide a model that allows to control and possibly to forecast the behaviour of the underlying unknown system.

10219,Heterocyclyl linked a-alkoxy carboxylic acids as novel antidiabetic agents: design synthesis and computational validation studies,,Vijay Kumar,,,,,Patiala,The discovery of the crucial role of Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) as regulators of lipid and glucose metabolism has raised interest in the development of synthetic ligands as potential tool for therapeutic intervention in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome.  newlineAn important class of compounds currently under focus in the same category is dual activators of Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (.). Each of these subtypes appears to be differentiated in a tissue-specific manner and to play a pivotal role in glucose and lipid homeostasis. Special efforts to design multiple activating molecules can be successfully made using computational methods. Knowledge of the 3D structure of all the targeted receptors is of an advantage. PPAR agonists enhance insulin action and promote glucose utilization in peripheral tissues. PPAR agonists improve insulin sensitivity associated with obesity and mediate their effects on lipid metabolism. Therefore PPAR/ dual activators provide superior profile toward the control of hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. So. we first aimed to work on the hypothesis that PPAR/ dual agonism must provide additive and positive synergistic pharmacology. and laid down certain objectives to meet and fulfill the issues facing the development of dual activating agonists: a balance between and activity.  newlineThe fact that dual PPARand#945;/and#947; activators though highly potent agonists of PPARand#945; and and#947;; they lead to various undesirable adverse effects (cardiovascular. hepatic. carcinogenic etc.) came into picture in the due course of time during the research …,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:ybgmOu3m07wC,0,https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/10230,,,,,0
10220,A review on the concept of inbreeding and its impact on livestock,,Aayush Yadav and Asit Jain and Jyotimala Sahu and Ashutosh Dubey and Rajkumar Gadpayle and Deepti Kiran Barwa and Vikash Kumar,,,,,,Inbreeding is the breeding between more closely related animals than the average relationship of animals within the population of interest and shares a common ancestry for the last five to six generations. Though it develops inbred lines. prepotent progenies and unmasks and removes recessive deleterious alleles from the population. it is found to reduce the reproductive. fitness and survival performances of offspring due to the inbreeding depression. The more negative outcomes of inbreeding than the positive ones have evolved various ways of avoiding inbreeding. However. it is unavoidable and may occur at the farmers’ level during selective breeding programmes. Therefore. it is advised to use the optimum breeding strategies to minimize the rate of inbreeding to within the sustainable levels.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:Liyi5BL3lGIC,0,http://www.faunajournal.com/archives/2019/vol6issue5/PartA/6-4-23-520.pdf,,,,http://www.faunajournal.com/archives/2019/vol6issue5/PartA/6-4-23-520.pdf,0

High accuracy in segmentation of lung results in high accuracy of detection of diseases from lungs. For the past four decades multiple techniques were proposed for automatic segmentation of lungs. In this paper. we propose a hybrid segmentation technique based on Bat optimized fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. The output of the fuzzy c-means is given to level set to finalize the segmentation of the lungs. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated using two public chest x ray datasets: JRST and Montgomery County. JRST contains 247 chest X-rays and MC dataset contains 138 chest X-rays. The Jaccard coefficient for the proposed segmentation technique is 95.1 which is on par with the state of art segmentation techniques.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:MBnQv3n-1h8C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rajesh_Dwivedi4/publication/335396223_ebenezer1212/links/5d637ed9458515d610253992/ebenezer1212.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rajesh_Dwivedi4/publication/335396223_ebenezer1212/links/5d637ed9458515d610253992/ebenezer1212.pdf,0

The standard EER is calculated at 35 C ambient temperature; moreover. it does not consider varying weather conditions prevailing over a season. Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) gives a better representation of AC efficiency because it considers seasonal temperature variations also. A comparative analysis is performed for inverter AC vs. conventional AC using standard tests data from the manufacturers to compare EER and SEER values at different ambient temperatures. The effect of temperature differential on AC performance is also studied. The test result indicates SEER values to be more consistent.

10257,Determents of Customer Satisfaction Towards Herbal Products in selected area of Tamilnadu,,M VIJAY and V SURESH KUMAR,,,,,,The ever-changing marketing scenario and heightened competition over the globe has amplified the role of herbal brand at unparalleled level. Every person is a consumer of different brands at the same time. The choice and usage of a particular herbal brand by the consumer over the time is affected by the quality benefits offered by the brand especially when it comes to brand of eatables and cosmetics. Consumer satisfaction is derived when he compares the actual performance of the product with the performance he expected out of the usage. Philip Kotler (2008) observed that satisfaction is a person's feelings of pressure or disappointment resulting from product's perceived performance (outcome) in relation to his or her expectations. If the perceived benefits turned out to be almost same as expected. customer is highly satisfied and that is how the company achieves loyalty of the customer towards the herbal products.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:BJrLMYCRBhgC,0,http://infokara.com/gallery/99-oct-3116.pdf,,,,http://infokara.com/gallery/99-oct-3116.pdf,0

10261,The Kherwar Movement: Continuity and Contrast,,Vikash Kumar and Kavita Prasad,,,,,,“Kherwar” is an ancient name of the Santhal tribe. and carries overtones of the tribal golden age. The term was used after 1875 to describe any person who practised the new Santhal religion. The Kherwar also called themselves''SaphaHor''. or pure Santhals. The Kherwar movement is not related to the hinduized Kharwar tribe of Palamu district adjoining Ranchi district to the northwest. Kherwar movement refers to all concerted. political and religious activities by the Santhals between 1858 and 1900 for the sake of convenience. The Kherwar abandoned the violence of 1855 rebellion as a way to restore Santhal solidarity and continued their efforts in post-independence era too despite issues of divergence owing to inter-tribal and intra-tribal conflicts. The continuity is reflective of the recoil capacity of their tradition and persistence.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:VXkaQG_c9EQC,0,http://www.the-criterion.com/V8/n4/HM08.pdf,,,,http://www.the-criterion.com/V8/n4/HM08.pdf,0

Public demands for colour-free discharges into water have given decolorization of a variety of industrial wastewater the top priority. The oxidative enzymes approach is believed to be a promising technology. since it is cost-effective. environment friendly. highly specific and does not produce sludge. An industrial application of laccase for dye decolorization requires large amounts of readily available laccase at low cost. which is stable under operational conditions. and recyclable. Therefore. the first goal of this study was the search for an efficient production and purification system of the laccase enzyme. Sixteen fungal species were obtained from various culture collection centers in India. and screened for laccase activity by the indicator plate method; of these five species were found to be laccase-positive. Growing laccase utilization in numerous biotechnological applications encourages the search for high benefit/cost ratio purification methodology such as Three Phase Partitioning (TPP). The next goal of the present study was to develop an immobilization protocol for laccase enzyme. and its further use in dye removal. Cross-Linked Enzyme Aggregates (CLEAs) is a simple and effective methodology for laccase immobilization. The biodegradation of dyes and effluents was monitored by UV vis spectroscopy and HPLC. The results showed that color was removed by UV-visible spectroscopy. The HPLC analysis confirmed the biotransformation of dyes and effluents into several degradation products.

The selenocysteine amino acid contributes to the structure of this protein. Here a comparative study on sequence based methods and property based methods is carried out on all curated sequences of Glutathione Peroxidase for Human. Swiss Prot database was explored and only 65 protein of GPx family was obtained out of which 18 curated sequences were used for further analysis. Sequence based Distance method of Multiple Sequence Analysis is used for finding similar groups. Then all 18 sequences were studied for number of cleavage sites analysis followed by hierarchical clustering which represents cleavage sites based similar groups. Further. these sequences were computed to find amino acid composition and various properties like theoretical PI. Instability Index. Alipahtic Index and Hydropathy. followed by Hierarchical clustering. The interesting fact obtained in this study is that on comparison with the cleavage sites based clustering and amino acid composition with properties based clustering is having similar type of groups. These similar groups are having no relation sequence based methods groups.

10281,Cranial Fasciitis of Childhood with Underlying Solid Aneurysmal Bone Cyst of Temporal Bone,,A Jassar and VK Kumar and A Kumar,1017,Ann Infect Dis Epidemiol. 2017; 2 (2),,,,Cranial fasciitis is a rare variant of pseudosarcomatous fibroblastic/myofibroblastic proliferation. seen almost exclusively in children. Most cases are idiopathic. though in some a history of trauma has been elucidated. Cases of suspected cranial fasciitis must be worked up radiologically to rule out intracranial extension. We present a case of cranial fasciitis in a ten-year old girl that showed involvement of temporal bone radiologically and subsequently turned out to be a solid aneurysmal bone cyst of the temporal bone on biopsy. It is likely that extralesional stromal hemorrhages from the cyst incited a reactive fibroblastic response in the form of cranial fasciitis in this case.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:E2dP09oujfMC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=726983833669440819&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0
10282,ALL UNIT INTERCONNECTION ALGORITHM FOR VEHICULAR AD-HOC NETWORKS,,SAURABH SRIVASTAVA and OPINDER KUMAR and SARVESH KUMAR and VIJAY KUMAR,,,,,,Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is a very new and blooming technology which takes care about the transportation system of ground level. The most important function of VANET is to broadcast or send emergency message to each and every vehicle in range of danger zone. such that vehicles can get out of that area without any further problems. There are several broadcast schemes which are used but they are not efficient enough to prevent shadowing or intersection problem. broadcast storm and connection hole problem.

The working is based on Arduino Uno. Servo motor. Ultrasonic sensor. The idea is to first code the entire working using our previous knowledge of programming. The code will then be simulated on software and later be interfaced with the hardware or Arduino Uno. The ultrasonic sensor movement is maintained by the servo motor fixed within it. The servo motor is made to revolve through fixed angles; if object is detected then the angle position is sent as the input to the launcher fixed servo motor. The launcher will release the missile fixed within it.

10289,A Study on Geotechnical Properties of Flyash Mixed with Bentonite,,P Pandey and V Prakash and V Kumar,,,,,,In this study commercially available bentonite was mixed with locally available nearby thermal plants fly ash in different proportion (ie 0%. 2%. 4%. 8%. 12% & 20%). Fly ash are non plastic & possess very low shrinkage. With the addition of bentonite in the mixture. the plasticity is expected to increase & the fly ash is expected to reduce the swelling & shrinkage. preventing formation of any cracks. Due to its swelling properties. bentonite in the mixture is expected to act as a self sealing. low permeability hydraulic barrier. To determine the viability of fly ash–bentonite mixture as a liner material. the laboratory tests were conducted to obtain the various geotechnical parameters such as plastic limit. liquid limit. plasticity. shrinkage limit. differential free swell index & linear shrinkage. It was found that a mixture of bentonite with fly ash with the percent of bentonite in the mixture between 12-20%. induced plasticity in the fly ash–bentonite mixture which led to better bonding between particles upon compaction.,True,-AOlxRAAAAAJ:tntj4plCNvAC,0,https://www.krishisanskriti.org/vol_image/06Aug201706084013%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20P%20Pandey%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20796-800.pdf,,,,https://www.krishisanskriti.org/vol_image/06Aug201706084013%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20P%20Pandey%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20796-800.pdf,0
