0,"Stereolithography is a solid freeform technique (SFF) that was introduced in the late 1980s. Although many other techniques have been developed since then, stereolithography remains one of the most powerful and versatile of all SFF techniques. It has the highest fabrication accuracy and an increasing number of materials that can be processed is becoming available. In this paper we discuss the characteristic features of the stereolithography technique and compare it to other SFF techniques. The biomedical applications of stereolithography are reviewed, as well as the biodegradable resin materials that have been developed for use with stereolithography. Finally, an overview of the application of stereolithography in preparing porous structures for tissue engineering is given.",Ferry PW Melchels and Jan Feijen and Dirk W Grijpma,1502,6541872660049310383,,24,6121-6130,Elsevier,A review on stereolithography and its applications in biomedical engineering,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961210005661,31,2010
1,"This review covers new experimental and theoretical physical research related to the formation of polymeric membranes by phase separation of a polymer solution, and to the morphology of these membranes. Two main phase separation processes for polymeric membrane formation are discussed: thermally induced phase separation and immersion precipitation. Special attention is paid to phase transitions like liquid-liquid demixing, crystallization, gelation, and vitrification, and their relation to membrane morphology. In addition, the mass transfer processes involved in immersion precipitation, and their influence on membrane morphology are discussed.",P Van de Witte and PJ Dijkstra and JWA Van den Berg and J Feijen,1301,13732209564217571805,,1-2,1-31,Elsevier,Phase separation processes in polymer solutions in relation to membrane formation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0376738896000889,117,1996
2,"Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on aqueous solutions of polyCZV-isopropylacrylamide-co-butyl methacrylate-co-X), with X being hydrophilic, hydrophobic, cationic, or anionic comonomers, to elucidate the mechanism of temperature-induced phase separation and the effect of comonomer content, hydrophilicity, and charge on the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The endothermic heat of phase separation, which is related to the breaking of hydrogen bonds between water molecules surrounding hydrophobic moieties on the polymer, was a linear, decreasing function of the LCST. This suggests that the hydrophobic interactions between polymer side groups, which are the major driving force for phase separation, are enhanced at elevated temperatures due to a decrease in the structuring of water around hydrophobic side groups. It is concluded that the changes in LCST caused by the …",Herman Feil and You Han Bae and Jan Feijen and Sung Wan Kim,1132,10538482510930661980,Macromolecules,10,2496-2500,American Chemical Society,Effect of comonomer hydrophilicity and ionization on the lower critical solution temperature of N-isopropylacrylamide copolymers,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ma00062a016,26,1993
3,"In the past decade, polymersomes (also referred to as polymeric vesicles) have attracted rapidly growing interest based on their intriguing aggregation phenomena, cell and virus-mimicking dimensions and functions, as well as tremendous potential applications in medicine, pharmacy, and biotechnology. Unlike liposomes self-assembled from low molecular weight lipids, polymersomes are in general prepared from macromolecular amphiphiles of various architectures including amphiphilic diblock, triblock, graft and dendritic copolymers. Polymersomes exhibit very unique features highlighted with high stability, tunable membrane properties, versatility, and capacity of transporting hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic species such as anticancer drugs, genes, proteins, and diagnostic probes.

5,"In the past few years, protein biochips have emerged as promising proteomic and diagnostic tools for obtaining information about protein functions and interactions. Important technological innovations have been made. However, considerable development is still required, especially regarding protein immobilization, in order to fully realize the potential of protein biochips. In fact, protein immobilization is the key to the success of microarray technology. Proteins need to be immobilized onto surfaces with high density in order to allow the usage of small amount of sample solution. Nonspecific protein adsorption needs to be avoided or at least minimized in order to improve detection performances. Moreover, full retention of protein conformation and activity is a challenging task to be accomplished.

6,"A cross-linking method for collagen-based biomaterials was developed using the water-soluble carbodiimide 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EN). Cross-linking using EDC involves the activation of carboxylic acid groups to give 0-acylisourea groups, which form cross-links after reaction with free amine groups. Treatment of dermal sheep collagen (DSC) with EDC (E-DSC) resulted in materials with an increased shrinkage temperature (T5) and a decreased free amine group content, showing that cross-linking occurred. Addition of N-hydroxysuccinimide to the EDC-containing cross-linking solution (E/N-DSC) increased the rate of cross-linking. Cross-linking increased the 7, of non-cross-linked DSC samples from 56 to 73 C for E-DSC and to 66 C for E/N-DSC samples, respectively. For both cross-linking methods a linear relation between the decrease in free amine group content and the increase in Ts was observed. The tensile strength and the high strain modulus of E/N-DSC samples decreased upon cross-linking from 18 to 15 MPa and from 26 to 16 MPa, respectively. The elongation at break of E/N-DSC increased upon cross-linking from 142 to 180%.",LHH Olde Damink and PJ Dijkstra and MJA Van Luyn and PB Van Wachem and P Nieuwenhuis and J Feijen,882,12014178595900017569,Biomaterials,8,765-773,Elsevier,Cross-linking of dermal sheep collagen using a water-soluble carbodiimide,https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/6862443/Olde_Damink96cross.pdf,17,1996
7,"Meshes of collagen and/or elastin were successfully prepared by means of electrospinning from aqueous solutions. Flow rate, applied electric field, collecting distance and composition of the starting solutions determined the morphology of the obtained fibres. Addition of PEO (M w= 8× 1 0 6) and NaCl was always necessary to spin continuous and homogeneous fibres. Spinning a mixture of collagen and elastin resulted in fibres in which the single components could not be distinguished by SEM. Increasing the elastin content determined an increase in fibres diameters from 220 to 600 nm. The voltage necessary for a continuous production of fibres was dependent on the composition of the starting solution, but always between 10 and 25 kV. Under these conditions, non-woven meshes could be formed and a partial orientation of the fibres constituting the mesh was obtained by using a rotating tubular mandrel as …",Laura Buttafoco and Nico G Kolkman and Paula Engbers-Buijtenhuijs and Andreas A Poot and Pieter J Dijkstra and Istvan Vermes and Jan Feijen,661,13610862239659866655,Biomaterials,5,724-734,Elsevier,Electrospinning of collagen and elastin for tissue engineering applications,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961205005910,27,2006
8,The in vitro interaction of human endothelial cells (HEC) and polymers with different wettabilities in culture medium containing serum was investigated. Optimal adhesion of HEC generally occurred onto moderately wettable polymers. Within a series of cellulose type of polymers the cell adhesion increased with increasing contact angle of the polymer surfaces. Proliferation of HEC occurred when adhesion was followed by progressive flattening of the cells.,PB Van Wachem and T Beugeling and Jan Feijen and A Bantjes and JP Detmers and WG Van Aken,636,13936616111210333494,Biomaterials,6,403-408,Elsevier,Interaction of cultured human endothelial cells with polymeric surfaces of different wettabilities,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.987.9631&rep=rep1&type=pdf,6,1985
9,"The formation of Schiff bases during crosslinking of dermal sheep collagen (DSC) with glutaraldehyde (GA), their stability and their reactivity towards GA was studied. All available free amine groups had reacted with GA to form a Schiff base within 5 min after the start of the reaction under the conditions studied (0.5% (w/w) GA). Before crosslinks are formed the hydrolysable Schiff bases initially present were stabilized by further reaction with GA molecules. An increase in shrinkage temperature (T s) from 56°C for non-crosslinked DSC (N-DSC) to 78°C for GA crosslinked DSC (G-DSC) was achieved after crosslinking for 1 h. From the relationship between the free amine group content and the T s during crosslinking it was concluded that higher GA concentrations and longer reaction times will result in the introduction of pendant-GA-related molecules rather than crosslinks.

The fibrils were deposited on glass substrates that are partly coated with Teflon AF®. A modified AFM tip was used to accurately deposit epoxy glue droplets on either end of the collagen fibril that cross the glass‐Teflon AF® interface, as to such attach it with one end to the glass and the other end to the AFM tip. Single collagen fibrils have been mechanically tested in ambient conditions and were found to behave reversibly up to stresses of 90 MPa. Within this regime a Young's modulus of 2–7 GPa was obtained. In aqueous media, the collagen fibrils could be tested reversibly up to about 15 MPa, revealing Young's moduli ranging from 0.2 to at most 0.8 GPa.

In the early 1950's, serious environmental problems were iden tified with the discovery of the persistence of chlori nated pesticides in the ecosystem, ably pUblicized by Rachel Carson in her book, The Si lent Spring. About the same time, the widespread use of automatic dish washers and laundry machines required the use of syn thetic detergents in place of conventional soaps. These early detergents were not completely degraded in municipal sewage plants, and caused foaming and other related problems in the downstream water effluent. As a result, soap companies quickly developed so-called"" biodegradable"" detergents in which the branched alkyl chains used in detergent synthesis were replaced by linear alkanes, thus accelerating the rate of biodegra dation of these compounds in the biologically active sewage process. The success of this new chemistry gave t-be impression to the general pUblic that something that was"" biodegradable"" was inherently good for the natural environment.This simplistic notion gained further momentum as a result of an advertising campaign initiated by the paper industry about the same time, in a desperate at tempt to retain their markets in the packaging industry against the expanding use of plastics.

Development of simple, convenient initiators for controlled ring-opening polymerization of cyclic esters is important from a practical as well as a fundamental point of view. Recently, it was reported that trivalent rare earth alkoxides can initiate living polymerization of monomers such as ϵ-caprolactone, lactide, and-butyrolactone with activities unprecedented in coordination polymerization of these monomers. 1-5 We now report a highly efficient catalyst system for the preparation of polyesters based on lanthanide tris (2, 6-di-tert-butylphenolate) s and various alcohols, allowing excellent control over molecular weight and end-group identity.

A prerequisite for further development is the design and synthesis of novel multifunctional biomaterials that are biocompatible and biologically active, are biodegradable with a controlled degradation rate, and have tunable mechanical properties. In the past decades, different types of α-amino acid-containing degradable polymers have been actively developed with the aim to obtain biomimicking functional biomaterials. The use of α-amino acids as building units for degradable polymers may offer several advantages: (i) imparting chemical functionality, such as hydroxyl, amine, carboxyl, and thiol groups, which not only results in improved hydrophilicity and possible interactions with proteins and genes, but also facilitates further modification with bioactive …",Huanli Sun and Fenghua Meng and Aylvin A Dias and Marc Hendriks and Jan Feijen and Zhiyuan Zhong,177,9683543236385288211,,6,1937-1955,American Chemical Society,"α-Amino acid containing degradable polymers as functional biomaterials: rational design, synthetic pathway, and biomedical applications",https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bm200043u,12,2011

The ability of CNS to produce slime has been suggested to play a critical role in the adhesion onto surfaces of implants and medical devices [2] and in the course of medical device-associated infections [3]. Staphylococcus aureus, the pathogenic counterpart of CNS, can be encapsulated [4]. Such strains possessed increased virulence in comparison with their non-encapsulated variant strains [5, 6]. Characterization of CNS has been advocated [7, 8], but no special attention has been given to the presence of a capsule, although encapsulated CNS have been reported [9]. Bacterial adhesion onto surfaces is also regarded to be an important virulence factor [10]. Bacterial interaction with mammalian cells and artificial surfaces is promoted by the hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell surface [11-13].

Immobilization of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to substrates used to coat or fill porous prostheses may enhance the formation of a confluent monolayer of ECs. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were grown on bFGF‐loaded albumin–heparin conjugate bound to CO2 gas‐plasma‐treated polystyrene. In the order of 2–3 ng/cm2 bFGF had to be immobilized to form a confluent monolayer of HUVECs. The most prominent effect of surface‐immobilized bFGF was stimulation of the proliferation shortly after seeding, resulting within 3 days in confluent cell monolayers with high density.

168,"Polymers and copolymers of different methacrylates were synthesized and coated on glass slides. The surfaces of the polymer films were characterized by their water contact angles and~"" potentials using the Wilhelmy plate technique and streaming potential measurements, respectively. From contactangle measurements information was also obtained about mobility of surface polymer chains. Receding contact angles of methyl methacrylate (MMA) copolymers containing hydrophilic or charged units were decreased as compared to the MMA homopolymer. When charged hydroxyethyi methacrylate (HEMA) copolymers were compared with the HEMA homopolymer, the advancing contact angles increased, probably due to reorientation of surface polymer chains. The receding contact angles of poly (alkyl methacrylates) first increased and then decreased with increasing side-chain lengths. These changes were related to the mobility of the different polymers. Incorporation of positively or negatively charged groups in MMA or HEMA polymers accordingly changed the~"" potential of the polymers.© 1985 Academic Press, Inc.",AH Hogt and DE Gregonis and JD Andrade and SW Kim and J Dankert and Jan Feijen,88,7680538253423388078,Journal of colloid and interface science,2,289-298,Academic Press,Wettability and ζ potentials of a series of methacrylate polymers and copolymers,https://research.utwente.nl/files/6881087/Hogt85wettability.pdf,106,1985

193,"Highly transparent (>80%) and conductive layers (10-6 S/cm) were obtained by the pulsed plasma polymerization of thiophene. The influence of power, pressure, pulse time, duty cycle, and position in the reactor on the conductivity of the resulting plasma polymerized thiophene (PPT) layers was evaluated. In the used ranges, only pressure had a significant influence on the conductivity of the deposited layer. The results could be correlated to the effect of the deposition parameters on the fragmentation of the thiophene monomer. At high pressure there was less fragmentation of thiophene, resulting in a higher conductivity of the layer. It was shown that the use of a pulsed plasma as a means to minimize fragmentation is most efficient when the off time is chosen such that the reactor is replenished with new monomer during the off period.

The unique properties of poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (N-isopropylacrylamide)(PEG-PNIPAAm) block and graft copolymers in water have recently attracted a lot of attention. 1-3 Part of the interest concerns the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAAm in water that can be tuned close to body temperature by copolymerization and may therefore be applied in the biomedical field as a stimulus-sensitive material.

For an intermediate block ratio (66/33), the stereocomplex form is obtained at high crystallization temperatures while a coexistence region with homocrystal phase exists at low temperatures. In addition to the transition enthalpy, size effects and kinetic routes play a role in the competition between the stereocomplex and the homocrystalline forms.

238,"Synthetic biodegradable polymers are of great value for the preparation of implants that are required to reside only temporarily in the body. The use of biodegradable polymers obviates the need for a second surgery to remove the implant, which is the case when a nondegradable implant is used. After implantation in the body, biomedical devices may be subjected to degradation and erosion. Understanding the mechanisms of these processes is essential for the development of biomedical devices or implants with a specific function, for example, scaffolds for tissue-engineering applications. For the engineering and regeneration of soft tissues (e.g., blood vessels, cardiac muscle and peripheral nerves), biodegradable polymers are needed that are flexible and elastic. The scaffolds prepared from these polymers should have tuneable degradation properties and should perform well under long-term cyclic deformation …",Erhan Bat and Zheng Zhang and Jan Feijen and Dirk W Grijpma and André A Poot,60,7184103300088592517,Regenerative medicine,3,385-398,Future Medicine Ltd,Biodegradable elastomers for biomedical applications and regenerative medicine,https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/abs/10.2217/rme.14.4,9,2014

240,"Glutaraldehyde fixation of bioprosthetic tissue has been used successfully for almost 40 years. However, it is generally recognized that glutaraldehyde fixation of bioprostheses is associated with the occurrence of calcification. Accordingly, many efforts have been undertaken to develop techniques for the fixation of bioprostheses, which will not lead to calcification. Here we describe a new improved carbodiimide based cross-linking method. Rather than cross-linking the tissue through its free primary amine groups, these groups were first blocked with butanal and the tissue was then cross-linked by means of carbodiimide activation of tissue carboxylic acid groups followed by a reaction with a poly(propylene glycol)bis 2-(aminopropyl) ether, (Jeffamine™).

Characterization with electrophoresis on polyacryl gel and immunoelectrophoresis did not reveal differences between labeled and nonlabeled HSA. The release of the label from labeled proteins in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was studied as a function of time. 125I-labeled proteins were stable and 99mTc-labeled proteins showed different stabilities depending on the labeling method which was used. The adsorption behavior of labeled HSA and HSA onto polystyrene (PS) and silicon rubber (SR) was studied by using two methods. It appeared that all labeled HSA compounds showed a preferential adsorption onto PS (and SR) substrates. The 99mTc-labeled HSA showed a high value of the preferential adsorption factor (φ ⪢ 1).

Human plasma fibronectin was shown to bind heparins in both the solution and adsorbed states. Fibronectin was shown to have six active binding sites for heparins which may be stericaUy blocked in some adsorbed states. 125I-Fibronectin monolayer concentrations were shown to be significantly different on polyvinyl chloride surfaces when compared to hydrophilic/hydrophobic silica, Biomer, Silastic, and polystyrene surfaces. Preadsorbing fibronectin to various substrates and then allowing heparins to interact with the protein monolayer made it possible to bind up to 0.2 t~ g/cm 2 heparin in a plasma environment. This fibronectin-heparin complex was at least 85% stable in plasma and buffer solutions for up to 8 h time. The complex was observed to prolong blood clotting times two to three times over that of controls as assayed by Activated Partial Thromboplastin Times. All of the bound heparin was observed to be active by its ability to bind Factor X, in plasma. Monolayers of blood proteins adsorbed from human serum were not observed to be active in binding heparins.

307,"In order to introduce carboxylic acid groups at the surface of poly(ethylene) (PE) films, an attempt was made to covalently link a preadsorbed layer of poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) on a PE film by an argon or tetrafluoromethane (CF4) plasma treatment. Surface analysis was performed by XPS (X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and water contact angle measurements. It was shown that by treatment of a PAAc layer preadsorbed on PE with an argon or a CF4 plasma, a small amount of carboxylic acid groups was introduced at the surface. A similar amount of these groups was obtained by plasma treatment of PE films without a preadsorbed PAAc layer. A comparison of the etching rates of PAAc and PE by either an argon or a CF4 plasma, showed that PAAc is etched much faster by both types of plasmas than PE.

Interventions of distal left main (LM) disease generally require stenting across the LM bifurcation with inherent vessel tapering along this segment and a high likelihood of stent malapposition, which can be avoided by such postdilations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen DES (four 3.5 mm-samples of Cypher Select Plus, Taxus Liberté, Endeavor Resolute, Xience V) were deployed in water; 12 samples were then proximally postdilated with noncompliant 5.0 mm balloons at 18 atm. All samples were examined by micro-computed tomography. Taxus Liberté, Endeavor Resolute, and Xience V, showed increased cell areas in the transitional region (just distal to postdilated region), while Cypher Select showed its largest cells inside the postdilated region. Overall, the largest maximum cell area was observed in Endeavor Resolute, while Cypher Select showed the smallest (p< 0.001, for both). In addition, the size of the very proximal postdilated cells was relatively small in most DES except Xience V.

The hydrophilicity of the networks could by varied by mixing NVP and VAc at different ratios. The prepared network extracts were compatible with NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.

Young's moduli of single elastic fibers immersed in water, devoid of or containing fibrillin–microfibrils, were determined using bending tests. Bending freely suspended elastic fibers on a micro-channeled substrate by a tip-less AFM cantilever generated a force versus displacement curve from which Young's moduli were calculated. For single elastic fibers, Young's moduli in the range of 0.3–1.5 MPa were determined, values not significantly affected by the presence of fibrillin–microfibrils.

Endothelial cells lining the inner side of blood vessels can provide the graft lumen with an antithrombogenic surface. One of the remaining problems is cell detachment after restoration of blood flow, because of infiltration of leukocytes that respond to an inflammatory‐like activation of the endothelial cells. This endothelial activation is possibly caused by the surface characteristics of the underlying polymer. To get more insight into the effects of the polymer surface on endothelial cell activation, we seeded human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in various densities and subsequently grew them on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS; hydrophilic) and polystyrene (PS; hydrophobic) surfaces.

For rapidly crystallizing polymers, solid–liquid demixing processes also generate porous morphologies. In this study, the interference of both phase transitions has been analyzed theoretically using the Flory–Huggins theory for ternary polymer solutions. It is demonstrated that four main thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are important for the structure formation in solution: the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization, the ratio of the molar volumes of the solvent and the nonsolvent, the polymer–solvent interaction parameter, and the rate of crystallization of the polymer compared to the rate of solvent‐nonsolvent exchange.

After exposing polymer films to high pressure CO2, the wave number of the absorption maxima of the polymer carbonyl groups shifted to higher values. Also, due to the interaction between CO2 and the carbonyl groups of the polymers, a new broad peak in the bending mode region of CO2 appeared.

The development of synthetic pathways and catalyst/initiator systems to produce pre-designed polylactides, as well as the fundamental understanding of the  polymerization reactions, has continuously been an important topic. Here, we will address the recent advances in the ring-opening polymerization of lactides, with an emphasis on the highly versatile in situ generated initiator systems and single-site stereoselective initiators. The in  situ generated initiators including in situ formed yttrium, calcium and zinc alkoxides all have been shown to bring about a rapid and living polymerization of lactides under mild conditions, which facilitated the preparation of a variety of advanced lactide-based biomaterials.

354,"Cellulose triacetate (CTA) ultrafilters and cellulose acetate blend (CAB) desalination membranes were treated with a radiofrequency gas plasma (tetrafluoromethane (CF4) or carbon dioxide (CO2), 47–49 W, 0.04–0.08 mbar). Treatment times were varied between 15 s and 120 min. The plasma-treated top layer of the membranes was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and contact angle measurements to obtain information about surface structure, chemistry, and wettability, respectively. The membrane properties (e.g., permeability, selectivity, fouling) were studied by waterflux measurements, molecular weight cutoff measurements, and fouling experiments with bovine serum albumin. CO2 plasma treatment resulted in gradual etching of the membrane's dense top layer. Permeation and selectivity changed significantly for treatment times of 0–15 min for CTA and 5–60 …",MB Olde Riekerink and GHM Engbers and M Wessling and J Feijen,31,4409854105667076864,Journal of colloid and interface science,2,338-348,Academic Press,Tailoring the properties of asymmetric cellulose acetate membranes by gas plasma etching,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979701980294,245,2002
355,"Poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) films were treated with either an argon or a tetrafluoromethane (CF4) plasma and subsequently analyzed with X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). PAAc films were decarboxylated during both types of plasma treatments. In addition, during the CF4 plasma treatment, the PAAc films became fluorinated. The plasma phase during the argon plasma treatment of PAAc films was investigated with optical emission spectroscopy. It was shown that during this plasma treatment carbon dioxide, water, and possibly hydrogen were liberated from the PAAc surface. By covering the surface of PAAc films with different materials (lithium fluoride, UV fused silica, and glass) during the plasma treatment, it was possible to differentiate between photochemically induced and particle‐induced changes of the surface. This method was used to show that decarboxylation during the argon plasma treatment was …",Johannes GA Terlingen and Gijsbert AJ Takens and Frederik J Van Der Gaag and Allan S Hoffman and Jan Feijen,31,10108033507738946283,Journal of applied polymer science,1,39-53,"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company",On the effect of treating poly (acrylic acid) with argon and tetrafluoromethane plasmas: kinetics and degradation mechanism,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/app.1994.070520105,52,1994

357,"Cellular fibronectin is deposited on tissue culture polystyrene during the adhesion and spreading of cultured human endothelial cells (HEC). Following the seeding of HEC upon this polymer, larger amounts of fibronectin are deposited as both cell density and incubation time increase. Our results indicate that the ability to deposit cellular fibronectin onto a polymeric surface is a condition for the spreading and proliferation of HEC.",PB Van Wachem and T Beugeling and BWL Mallens and A Dekker and J Feijen and A Bantjes and WG Van Aken,31,6227069555737756154,Biomaterials,1,121-123,Elsevier,Deposition of endothelial fibronectin on polymeric surfaces,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014296128890083X,9,1988
